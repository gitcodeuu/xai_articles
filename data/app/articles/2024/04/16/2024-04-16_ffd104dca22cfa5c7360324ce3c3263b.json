  "content": "RAWALPINDI, Apr 16 (APP): The 264th Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) presided over by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarters on Tuesday took serious notice of the baseless propaganda against the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and the security forces, and resolved to launch strict legal action against the perpetrators.\n“The forum noted with concern the malicious propaganda campaign meant to demoralise the armed forces and underscored that unfounded and baseless allegations on law enforcement agencies and security forces have become a fashion and are part of the larger design to drive a wedge between the people and the Armed Forces of Pakistan. We will not allow such efforts to succeed and as per the law and Constitution, stern action will be ensured,” an Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) news release said.\nThe forum paid rich tribute to the supreme sacrifices of Shuhada (martyrs) including officers and men of the armed forces, law enforcement agencies and the citizens who have laid their lives for peace and stability in the country.\nThe COAS appreciated the untiring efforts of Pakistan Army and LEAs in successfully thwarting several terrorist attacks and neutralising key terrorist commanders during the ongoing counterterrorism operations.\nHe directed the commanders to pro-actively deny any space to the terrorists.\nThe Army Chief said, “The Armed Forces and LEAs of Pakistan, fully backed by the resilient nation, remain determined to permanently eliminate this menace from Pakistan, INSHA’ALLAH”.\nThe forum condemned the heinous terrorist attack against Chinese nationals in Besham as well as the killing of innocent civilians in Balochistan.\nIt was briefed on how terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan pose a threat to regional and global security, besides acting as proxies against Pakistan and its economic interests, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\nThe forum expressed serious concern over the ongoing Indian aggression in the Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), and reaffirmed that Pakistan would continue to provide political, diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri brothers and sisters.\nIt expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and condemned serious human rights violations, war crimes and genocide being perpetrated in Gaza.\nThe forum also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East and noted that a wider regional conflict could ensue if both sides did not de-escalate immediately.\nThe forum resolved to provide full support to the government towards achieving sustainable socioeconomic growth in the country, including wholehearted assistance in countering the illegal spectrum, particularly smuggling, hoarding, electricity theft and safe repatriation of all illegal foreigners.\nThe COAS directed the field commanders to ensure the highest standards of operational preparedness and motivation within their outfits and to pursue professional excellence through objective training.",
