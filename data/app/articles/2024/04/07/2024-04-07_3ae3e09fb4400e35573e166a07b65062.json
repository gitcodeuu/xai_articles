For instance, in 2019, we exhibited restraint by returning an Indian pilot as a goodwill gesture, despite India’s incursion following the Pulwama incident.”\nHe further asserted that terrorism in Pakistan had ties to India, suggesting that India was seeking to escalate tensions for political gain.\nHe accused Indian ministers of making statements aimed at securing political benefits.\nHe reiterated Pakistan’s determination to defend its sovereignty and protect its citizens against any hostile actions from India.",
