The teams from the CDA, MCI, and ICT were actively involved during heavy rainfall in Islamabad.\nThey responded promptly to complaints of standing water in various areas and ensured the clearance of water accumulated on highways.\nFurthermore, the special measures were undertaken on the highways, as per the CDA administration’s directives, to mitigate the impact of heavy rains on traffic flow and prevent issues such as traffic congestion.\nThe joint teams from CDA, MCI, and ICT were mobilized across CDA’s sectorial and non-sectorial areas, including housing societies and other low-lying regions.\nThe teams provided assistance, including the use of dewatering pumps, to drain water from low-lying areas, including residential properties.\nIt’s worth noting that in light of the rainy conditions, the holidays of relevant staff have been canceled. Additionally, the duties have been assigned to staff members at various intervals, and stringent monitoring of low-lying areas is being upheld.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
