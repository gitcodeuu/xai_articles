Our current level of bilateral trade relations doesn’t match the excellent ties between our two brotherly countries,” Prime Minister Shehbaz wrote in response to his Malaysian counterpart’s post.\nMalaysia’s Anwar Ibrahim said that in their meeting, they had expressed their commitment to strengthen bilateral cooperation and strategic partnership, including increasing trade relations which currently stood at US$1.4 billion.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz expressed his pleasure as both sides committed to unpacking the true potential and taking the Pakistan-Malaysia partnership to new heights. I look forward to building on our discussion in the days to come, he added.\nAnwar Ibrahim referred to the bilateral agreement on holding further discussions to develop cooperation in the industry and halal certification, particularly through JAKIM and the Pakistan Halal Authority.\nHe said Malaysia and Pakistan also intend to continue more cooperation in education, defense, tourism and human resources.\nIbrahim said that their discussion also touched on the ASEAN chairmanship next year. Malaysia through ASEAN is open to exploring the ASEAN-Pakistan cooperation space that can benefit regional countries.",
