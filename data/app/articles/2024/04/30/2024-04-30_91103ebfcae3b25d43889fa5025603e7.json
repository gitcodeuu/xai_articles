With a global workforce of more than 207,000 in 170+ countries and regions, Huawei has dedicated 55% of its personnel to research and development. The focus on R&D has resulted in more than 140,000 active patents worldwide.\nHuawei is working closely with carriers and partners around the world and in Pakistan to strengthen digital infrastructure, build out the ecosystem, and unleash the full value of connectivity.\nThe new Huawei 5.5G uses ultra-broadband as a foundation, determinacy as a differentiator and autonomy as an enabler. Having showcased the extensive portfolio of 5.5G, F5.5G, and Net5.5G products and solutions for multiple scenarios at MWC Barcelona 2024, the visitors experienced how this diverse offering empowers operators to build ubiquitous, efficient, and collaborative networks that pave the way for the intelligent world of tomorrow.\nYu Shaoning, Vice CEO of Government and Public Affairs, Huawei, said, “Huawei has served and collaborated with public and private sector partners over the past 25 years as the leading global carrier, enterprise solution provider and creator of cutting edge consumer products. In Pakistan, our objective is to support the Government in building a robust ICT talent ecosystem and accelerate the digitalization progress. We work closely with our partners to create solutions that optimize the outcomes for them.”\nPersonalized user experience, versatile business models, and scalable industrial applications are key success factors as customer demands continue to evolve. Use cases for Cloud and AI solutions demonstrate how innovative strengths can align with development objectives, and push the boundaries of the digital and intelligent era.\nHuawei Cloud is on the cutting edge of global technologies due to the rapid advancement of AI and foundation models, offering collaborative heterogeneous computing architecture, cloud-native computing with superlative performance, mass data storage, security compliance, lean governance, and flexible deployment.\nThe attention to green solutions and low-carbon and carbon-neutral alternatives of physical infrastructure drew the attention of many stakeholders as Pakistan is deeply affected by climate change. Green antennas will help build efficient 5.5G networks especially as there are no limits to deployment with optical and electromagnetic transparency reduce the site acquisition time and increase capability. Moreover, there is improved coverage and energy saving.\nThe shift to solar power solutions that are being optimised to limit the effect of shadow due to congestion is a key component of greening the entire network.\nWith customer-centricity as the core value proposition, Huawei delivers cutting-edge and innovative, highly reliable, low-latency, and secure cloud services. Huawei Cloud is becoming a solid cloud foundation and a robust engine for intelligence, delivering innovative, resilient, and trustworthy cloud services and industry solutions across different sectors in a more innovative, inclusive, and open approach.\nCoupled with top-notch networks and infrastructure, high-performance computing and AI solutions tailored to various industries such as e-commerce, automotive, finance, and government are the hallmarks of Huawei’s approach.
