He recalled the contribution of the Bandung Conference to the international community’s subsequent efforts for global peace as well as cooperation among the developing countries.\nHe particularly highlighted Pakistan’s whole-hearted support for the liberation struggles of African nations and Pakistan’s contribution to Africa’s peace and security through consistent participation in the UN peacekeeping operations since 1960.\nHe added that Pakistan’s overall engagement with Africa had been growing in recent years. In 2019, Pakistan expanded the scope of collaboration within the framework of its “Engage Africa” policy aimed at enlarging its diplomatic footprint in Africa and deepening economic partnership with the Continent.\nAmbassador Sohail concluded by saying that for Pakistan, deeper engagement with Africa remained a strategic imperative. Forging a strong and effective partnership for peace, progress and prosperity was an indispensable goal, which should be advanced through a clear vision, consistent policy, and a long-term strategy.\nSenator Mushahid, in his address, said that the launch of PAIDAR coincided with the 69th anniversary of the Bandung Conference, emphasizing Africa’s pivotal role in the South with 54 African Union members.\nHe underscored Pakistan’s longstanding ties with Africa, dating back to pre-independence when Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah initiated relations with Egypt in 1946.\nSenator Mushahid outlined PAIDAR’s objectives, aiming to reinvigorate Pakistan-Africa relations through people-to-people and business-to-business exchanges.\nHe said,”PAIDAR seeks to prioritize mutual interests, promoting cooperation in education, environment, trade, energy, and sustainable development goals.”\nMohammed Karmoune said that the relations between Pakistan and Africa were based on the principles of mutual respect, cooperation, and solidarity. Pakistan and Africa needed to work together to launch joint ventures in different economic sectors.\nHe said that development could be achieved mainly through science and technology, agriculture, industrial cooperation and the promotion of trade and investments.\nJemal Beker said that the ‘Look Africa’ and ‘Engage Africa’ policies of the Government of Pakistan were the steps in the right direction, which had led to the establishment of Ethiopia’s Mission in Islamabad as well as the commencement of Ethiopian airline direct flights to Pakistan.\nHe also highlighted mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides in various sectors.\nMary Nyambura Kamau highlighted the historical cooperation between Africa and Pakistan, which, she said, “is characterized by multifaceted collaboration at various levels, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the bond.”\nFor fortifying Pakistan-Africa cooperation, she stressed the importance of active exploration of various collaboration areas and engagement with Regional Economic Communities in Africa, such as ECCAS, ECOWAS, AMU, SADC, and EAC.\nShe urged Pakistan to focus on enhancing economic cooperation in trade, investment, joint ventures, tourism, and technology through regional blocks and bilateral levels.\nAmbassador Aftab Hassan said that Pakistan enjoyed historical and cordial relations with African countries under the ‘Bandung Spirit’ of solidarity.\nHe said that there was a pressing need for developing robust high-level contacts between Pakistan and African nations as well as strengthening institutional mechanisms to sustain long-term cooperation. In this context he suggested practical measures to further deepen diplomatic, economic, and people-to-people engagement with Africa.\nAmbassador Atif Sharif Mian stated that Ethiopia was one of most influential countries in Africa.\n“Pakistan attaches high importance to its relations with Ethiopia in recognition of her geo-economic potential and in line with Pakistan’s ‘Engage Africa’ policy. The Ethiopian leadership also espouses closer relations with Pakistan, which is evident by their decision to establish Ethiopian Mission in Islamabad in 2022.”\nAmbassador Arshad Jan Pathan said that the 21st century belonged to the Afro-Asia continents. “It is not the political will that is lacking; it is the will of the bureaucracy that is lacking to make the ‘Engage Africa’ policy a success. All stakeholders, particularly the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Commerce have to work together to make the policy a collective success.”\nHe also highlighted the challenges in the way of Pakistan’s increased collaboration with Africa-related regional platforms and proposed that PAIDAR should suggest solutions for addressing them.\nZafar Bakhtawri stressed the need for exploring business opportunities and increasing the presence of African missions in Pakistan and Pakistani Missions in Africa.\nHe highlighted the necessity for comprehensive exploration across various sectors to foster stronger ties between Pakistan and Africa.\nDr Bashir Bahar and Dr. Ismail Adaramola talked about the important role Pakistan had played in providing quality education to students from Africa in various Pakistani universities. They further highlighted that they both were products of Pakistani universities and now have the privilege of teaching in the universities they graduated from.\nShehryar Akbar Khan said that under the ‘Engage Africa’ policy, Pakistan remained committed to promoting peace, prosperity, and shared progress between the people of Pakistan and Africa. Under the policy, Phase-I had been successfully executed.\nHe said Pakistan’s more diplomatic missions in Africa would be established incrementally. In the last seven months, he said, the MOFA had processed 10 memorandums of understanding on establishing bilateral political consultations with various African countries.\nThe event concluded with the unveiling of PAIDAR’s official logo and a group photo. A large number of academics, area studies specialists, heads of think-tanks, students and members of Parliament, civil society, and the media attended the event.",
