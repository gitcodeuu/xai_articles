  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 18 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Attaullah Tarar, criticized Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Thursday, stating that individuals involved in last year’s May 9 attacks are now jeopardizing national interests.\nSpeaking to the media, Tarar emphasized that those who undermined the country’s interests were adversaries of Pakistan.\nHe expressed dismay at prioritizing political agendas and ego over national interests, highlighting the regrettable pattern of PTI leadership disowning statements against the country’s interests.\nTarar noted that PTI leaders were embroiled in corruption cases, lamenting that enemies of Pakistan struggle to accept investments in the country. He prayed for divine guidance for such individuals to speak in the country’s favour.\nThe minister condemned the actions stooping to anti-national levels, stressing that while criticism of the government and its policies is acceptable, criticizing Pakistan is intolerable. He acknowledged the support of friendly countries in investing and cooperating with Pakistan, expressing optimism for progress with Allah’s grace.\nAttaullah Tarar also affirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthen relations with friendly countries.",
