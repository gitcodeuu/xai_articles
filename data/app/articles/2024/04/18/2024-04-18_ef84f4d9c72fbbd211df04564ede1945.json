ecosystem,” she said.\nShe said that this was not a mere interaction of enthusiasm for technology, but it was a collection, it was a point to deliberate how IT was becoming the linchpin for transforming the world, societies, governance, economies, and transforming future.\nThe minister said: “The opportunities that the IT holds for us, for our nations, for our people come with challenges that we are ready to face and ready to overcome”.\nShe said that Pakistan’s digital progress and Pakistan’s position as a global stakeholder was underscored by its vibrant youth as tens of thousands

which is conducive to your growth,” the minister ensured.\nShe said: “Our IT vision is also driven by a whole-of-government approach that involves and trickles down from the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif whose main statement to us in every meeting and gathering is that the government has no business doing business as the government’s business is to support businesses, is to facilitate businesses, and to help businesses grow.”\nShe added that: “It is all supported by our whole-of-government institution, which is the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) , which is providing

gathered support and approval from the prime minister is the formulation of National Digital Commission that will be driving Pakistan’s efforts towards a digital ecosystem in three verticals – economy, governance, and society.\nShe expressed her hope that the national effort would also provide a lot of opportunities for the private sector to grow with the help of the government and to support the government.\nShe said that the government also recognized the potential of startups and the startup ecosystem that was here in Pakistan.\nShe said that the country had  absolutely brilliant minds, adding that she can quote such wonderful, innovative examples of the young people that she met during her previous portfolio as the special assistant to prime minister for youth

in the recent budget, the prime minister highlighted the importance of the IT sector, entrusting her with the task of formulating a dedicated budget to promote IT and added that this led to the establishment of startup funds to support innovation and entrepreneurship.\nThe minister said that the startup fund support from the government served as a crucial incentive for both local and international venture capitalists to invest in Pakistani startups.\nShe said that this initiative reflected the government’s unwavering trust in the potential of these startups to overcome financial and technical hurdles in product development and scaling.

And these E-Rozgar Centers and E-Learning Centers are initially created in Punjab when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif  was the chief minister Punjab.”\nShe said that these E-Rozgar Centers and E-Learning Centers at that point played a critical role in providing office spaces and plug-and-play opportunities for young, small, medium, and micro enterprises.\nSimilarly, she said the vision of the government, to make digital devices available was also something that she would like to mention.\n“We intend to carry forward those efforts now in order for us to be able to increase internet penetration, to increase access to digital devices, “ she said and added that in this regard, the government was also right now focused on ensuring a conducive policy for manufacturing of these devices in Pakistan and hopefully in near future also contributing to the export of these devices.\nThe minister said that the freelancing sector of Pakistan was another icon that can not be ignored.\nShe mentioned Pakistan’s top five freelancing economy status, highlighted tax reliefs, and emphasized future infrastructure like Erosgar centers and co-working spaces. She envisions freelancers evolving into micro, small, and medium enterprises, boosting Pakistan’s economy and exports.\nShe lauded the Prime Minister’s Youth Program for skilling 100,000 youth since 2013, with a recent focus on IT-driven skills.
