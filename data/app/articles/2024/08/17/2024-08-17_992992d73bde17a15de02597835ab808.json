He added that this can occur through handling or consuming meat from infected animals or through contact with contaminated animal products.\nHe emphasized the importance of proper handling and cooking of animal products to prevent the transmission of the virus.\nIn addition to animal-to-human transmission, Dr. Mashhood noted that Monkeypox can be spread through human-to-human contact.\nThis can occur through respiratory droplets, such as those produced by coughing or sneezing, or through contact with infected bodily fluids or skin lesions, he said.\nHe stressed the importance of practising good hygiene, such as frequent hand-washing and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), to prevent the transmission of the virus.\nThe expert also highlighted the importance of early detection and isolation of cases to prevent the spread of Monkeypox.\nHe noted that symptoms of the virus can include fever, headache, muscle aches, and skin lesions and that prompt medical attention is essential for effective treatment and prevention of complications.",
