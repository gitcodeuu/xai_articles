The medicine also treated infected rat, he went on to say.\nLater in the third stage, clinical trials were taken both in KMU and Gomal University by applying medicine on different patients.\nSome trials were also conducted in Chakdara area of Dir and almost all the patients expressed great satisfaction over result of the medicine, showing very encouraging results within a month period.\nLeish-Nat Z is easy to apply and is not painful as Glucantime, a pentavalent antimonial, serving as first line drug for treatment of CL, administered through injecting directly in infected skin, Momin explained.\n“I had sever pain and itching in my right leg due to infection of CL and despite of getting few injections from hospital, was not getting required results,” shared Abdul Shakoor, a security guard at KMU who dwells in Khyber District of KP, a hotspot of Leishminiasis.\n“After getting treatment of Leish-Nat Z therapy, the infection disappeared within a one period, giving me a great relief,” said Shakoor while showing healed portion of his infected skin.\nA number of other patients including a pharmacist, Fawad shared the benefits of newly discovered medicine in the treatment of CL and demanded its large scale production because of demand from several people within his neighborhood in Warsak area near Mohmand District.\n“We have applied for `Patent’ for registration of the invention and after approval will approach the Drugs Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) for large scale production of medicine through involvement of any pharmaceutical industry,” said Dr. Adnan Ameen of Gomal University.\nHe also disclosed that a project for large scale production of Leish-Nat Z is submitted to Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan and is in the final stages of approval.\nDr. Adnan also requested the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to extend support to the initiative by arranging its large scale production as a number of CL patients are in the thousands.\nAccording to data of Public Health Department of KP, the number of CL infection registered in province in 2023 is around 25,300. Due to an acute shortage of glucantime vials in government hospitals for the last several months, patients are facing great hardship in getting free treatment on regular basis.\nGlucantime injection in the open market are being sold at exorbitant rates of around Rs. 2000 per one and poor people can’t arrange more than 20 shots for treatment of patients, observed Dr. Momin.\nIn some hotspots of CL in KP including Mohmand, Khyber, Karak, Waziristan, there are three to four patients in each home who cannot afford purchase of medicine from market.\nThe cost of locally manufactured drug even at low scale production has been estimated as around Rs. 850 and one bottle can be used by more than one patient, he claimed.\n“If Leish-Nat Z is prepared on large scale and government provided some subsidy in its price, it will be very affordable, effective, easily available, pain free treatment and will provide relief to thousands of CL infected patients in Pakistan and even in Afghanistan,” Momin remarked.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
