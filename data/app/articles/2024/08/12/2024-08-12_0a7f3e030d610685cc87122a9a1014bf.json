The ambassador praised Pakistan’s skilled workforce and noted that South Korean IT companies were eager to invest in Pakistan, taking advantage of the country’s young talent.\nHe suggested that both nations could expand cooperation in areas like energy and infrastructure.

He expressed a strong desire to strengthen cultural ties, especially South Korea’s interest in Pakistan’s Gandhara heritage.\nThe ambassador announced plans for a Korea-Pakistan Gala in October, which will be held in Islamabad.\nThe event will bring together government officials and artists from both countries to celebrate and strengthen the relationship between South Korea and Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
