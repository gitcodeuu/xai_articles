  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 3 (APP):Chairperson Peace and Culture Organization, Mushaal Hussein Mullick on Saturday said that India failed to weaken the Kashmiris’ spirit of freedom and right to self-determination despite its tyranny and unilateral move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019.\nIn an exclusive interview with Radio Pakistan, she was wife of illegally detained Hurriyat leader Yasin Malik, said that the international community and world human rights organizations should ban terrorist organizations like RSS.\nShe said that immense discussion was held on the Indian initiative of August 5, 2019, at the global level and in India itself, adding that India wanted to resettle non-state residents, including retired army officers in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu Kashmir (IIOJK).\nMushaal said that India was leasing Kashmir’s land to foreigners and giving a false impression that the situation had returned to normal IIOJK, adding that Kashmiri people had mentally prepared themselves by looking at Indian illegal actions.\nAfter August 5, she said that the direct control of religious and tourist places and forest land had been taken over by the New Delhi government. Kashmiri people were being deprived of jobs quota and bank accounts of Kashmiris were also sealed.\nShe added that India was violating international laws in IIOJK and perpetrating gruesome human rights violations. Kashmiris had never attacked tourists in Kashmir like RSS, India has been trying to spread religious hatred in Kashmir by using the card of religious extremism, she added.\nIn response to a question, she said in the recent election, the Kashmiri people rejected the leadership that supported India for their survival. She said that the plight of IIOJK was very bad and pathetic as compared to the past and Pakistani and Kashmiri people should raise effective voices against Indian barbarism.\nIn response to another question, she said that after August 5, legislation was also passed regarding the targeting of minorities and the steps taken by India to promote the ideology of RSS and Hindutva.\n“India is badly trapped and its narrative badly broken,” the chairperson.\nShe expressed that the opinion of the world had now changed regarding the human rights situation in IIOJK as big voices were being raised in the United States (US) and other countries against India. She concluded that India’s relations with its neighbouring countries were also suffering from conflicts.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
