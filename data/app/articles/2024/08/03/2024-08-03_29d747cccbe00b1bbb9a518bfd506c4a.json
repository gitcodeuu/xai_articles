  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 03 (APP): Prime Minister’s (PM) Coordinator for Climate Change, Romina Khurshid Alam on Saturday vowed to table the draft legislation on prevention and protection of HIV AIDS in the National Assembly to get the law enacted for the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).\nThe Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and the UN AIDS jointly organised a consultative dialogue for drafting HIV legislation in ICT here which has been participated by a diverse number of participants hailing from civil society, officials from the Ministry of Health, National Services Regulations and Coordination, National Highways and Motorway Police, health experts, academia and media.\nSpeaking as chief guest on the occasion, the PM’s Coordinator for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Romina Khurshid Alam extended her gratitude to UNAIDS and SDPI for the endeavour and shared her arduous experiences while enacting HIV legislation for the transgender community which is considered as taboo in the society.\nShe while volunteering to table the legislation at the lower house of the Parliament demanded the forum to develop synergies and collaborations with the provincial governments to come up with a holistic piece of legislation that could be made a model at the national level to be replicated by the provinces.\nRomina Khurshid mentioned that it is necessary to adopt a proactive and out-of-the-box approach to devising solutions to cope with the HIV AIDS disease spread. She also demanded strict proposals for manufacturers of surgical and inoculation equipment including needles, syringes, gloves and others that could cause disease spread for poorly handling the infected materials.\nShe added that it was crucial to address HIV AIDS disease spread as it could be used as a weapon of biological warfare and a threat to the nation’s security if left unattended.\nIn his special remarks, Executive Director, SDPI, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said the Institute is welcoming and beneficial in catalyzing the efforts for sustainable development. He hoped that the lead role of the PM’s aide on Climate Change in taking forward the legislation at the forum of the National Assembly would help drive the process further.\nNational Coordinator, UN AIDS, Dr Syed Kaleem Imam delivered a detailed presentation on the draft legislation prepared by the UN AIDS team under his leadership.\nHe said the objective is to draw legislation for ICT which is aligned with global best practices and SDG3.3 (End the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases).\nThe legislation, he said will help in the prevention, treatment and protection of the disease and the infected masses. “37.7 million people are living with HIV globally, whereas in Pakistan from 2010-19, there has been an 84% increase in HIV cases” he added.\nHe said the UN AIDS through the legislative endeavour intends to eliminate stigma and discrimination towards the disease and infected and ensure access to treatment and dignity and respect of HIV infected.\nThe draft titled “ICT HIV and AIDS Act 2024”, he said comprised 38 sections prepared through a consultative process with a meticulous focus on the local, national and international laws enacted on the subject.\nThe legislation, he said once enacted would come into force at once and would also entail the formation of a Commission headed by a chairperson nominated by the prime minister to ensure implementation of the legislation.\nNational Coordinator, Strengthening Common Management Unit (CMU) for TB, HIV/AIDS and Malaria, Dr Razia Kaniz Fatima said the HIV Aids has been always a priority for the government which is no more a taboo as many milestones have been achieved in addressing disease spread and prevention.\nShe added that Pakistan is in the phase of transition in the realm of HIV AIDS disease management programme which has always been under the stewardship of the government. Dr Fatima suggested that the HIV testing should be integrated with other disease tests to gauge the disease prevalence ratio in the population and local level resources are required at the local level as the HIV infected are the most neglected and need support at the grassroots level.\nUN AIDS Country Director, Yuki Takimoto, on the occasion, said the draft legislation marked a crucial step towards the growing HIV epidemic in Pakistan. UN AIDS in support of the government and other relevant quarters is improving responses to reduce discrimination hindering HIV response, she added.\nFormer DG Health ICT, Dr Hassan Arooj proposed the forum to consider making the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) a part of the implementation body of the legislation, whereas the individuals discriminating against the HIV infected should also be addressed in the legislation as it is not only a medical but rather a social and cultural issue in Pakistan.\nExecutive Director COMSATS, Ambassador Nafees Zakaria said the diplomatic missions should be guided through this legislation to ensure check on illegal immigrants carrying HIV positive entry from abroad into the country.\nFormer Justice Lahore High Court and Member Supreme Court Bar Council, Hassan Raza Pasha suggested the forum to clarify the qualification for the chairperson of the Commission to ensure that relevant experts will head the critical law implementing body.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
