  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 3 (APP): The convener of All Parties Hurriyat Conference AJK Chapter, Ghulam Mohammad Safi Saturday appealed to the international community to intervene and help free the Kashmiri people from Indian rule as Kashmiris have been subjected to unbearable suffering under Indian occupation.\nTalking to PTV news channel, Safi emphasized that the international community has a moral obligation to act, citing the numerous UN resolutions that have recognized Kashmir’s right to self-determination.\nSafi’s appeal comes as Kashmiris prepare to mark August 5, the anniversary of India’s revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy. He called on the international community to stand in solidarity with the Kashmiri people and demand that India respect their fundamental rights and freedoms.\nHe urged world leaders to take concrete steps to pressure India to end its brutal suppression of dissent and allow the Kashmiri people to determine their own future.\nThe APHC leader also highlighted the dire human rights situation in Kashmir, where arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings have become commonplace.\nHe stressed that the international community’s inaction has only emboldened India to continue its atrocities, and that decisive action is needed to break the cycle of violence.\nThe APHC convener also expressed gratitude to those countries and organizations that have already spoken out against India’s actions in Kashmir, and urged others to follow suit.\nHe emphasized that collective action is needed to bring about a just and lasting resolution to the Kashmir conflict.\nGhulam Mohammad Safi emphasized that India’s adoption of the Hindutva ideology has severely damaged its reputation as a secular and democratic state.He noted that the international community has taken notice of the rising tide of Hindu nationalism, which threatens the very fabric of India’s pluralistic society.\nSafi warned that the Hindutva ideology is inherently exclusionary and discriminatory, seeking to establish Hindu supremacy at the expense of minority rights. He highlighted the alarming increase in hate crimes, lynching, and forced conversions, which have become commonplace in India under the current regime.\nThe APHC leader also drew attention to the systematic marginalization of minority communities, including Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and Dalits, who are being denied their basic rights and freedoms.\nHe stressed that the international community must recognize the grave threat posed by Hindutva and take concrete steps to hold India accountable for its actions. He urged world leaders to take a strong stance against India’s egregious violations of human rights and international law, and to support the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination.",
