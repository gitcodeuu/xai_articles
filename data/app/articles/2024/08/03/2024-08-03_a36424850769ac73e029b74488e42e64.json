  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 3 (APP):The Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) on Saturday collected water samples from Rawal Dam to ascertain causes of mass fish die-off sparked serious environmental concerns among the civic circles.\n“The recent fish die-off in Rawal Dam has raised alarm bells as the reservoir’s water levels continue to drop drastically. This situation has prompted swift action from the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), highlighting significant environmental concerns,” the EPA news release said.\nUnder the direction of Director General Pak-EPA, Farzana Altaf Shah an inspection was conducted in the supervision of Dr. Zaigham Abbas, Director (Lab/NEQS), and Ashiq Nawaz, Director (EIA/Mont) of EPA.\nThe team visited Rawal Dam to assess the current conditions and collect water samples from five critical points, including three inlet points: Kashmir Chowk Point, Diplomatic Enclave near Lake View Point, and AQ Khan Road Korang Point, as well as the center of the dam and the outlet spillway point.\nAt each location, the team conducted an on-site physiochemical analysis, measuring key indicators such as dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, turbidity, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Electrical Conductivity (EC) and water temperature.\nThese parameters are crucial for understanding the immediate environmental factors impacting aquatic life.\nTo ensure a comprehensive evaluation, samples have been sent to the CLEAN laboratory Pak-EPA for detailed chemical and microbial analysis. The results will provide insights into the potential causes of the fish die-off and help formulate necessary interventions.\nAn EPA official told APP that allegedly the main reason of contamination is untreated municipal effluent from surrounding areas of Bani Gala and Bahrakahu, whereas in addition, it is the responsibility of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to install waste water treatment plants for the effluent of sewage water.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
