  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 20 (APP): Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik said on Wednesday that while every political party has the right to protest, it must be conducted peacefully and within the bounds of the law.\nTalking to a private news channel, he said that no one would be allowed to take the law into their hands under the guise of political demonstrations.\nResponding to a question about the denial of permission to PTI for a political rally, Minister said, “How can we permit those who openly talk about coming to Islamabad and seizing control?”\nHe warned that inciting people and attacking state installations and disrespecting martyrs cannot be associated with peaceful protests.\nThe minister made it clear that any attempt to repeat the events of May 9, when violent protests erupted, would be thwarted.\n“The state will take action against those who break the law,” he added.\nMalik also highlighted the ongoing organized campaigns against the heads of state institutions, stating that the entire nation stands united in strengthening these institutions.\nHe said that reducing polarization and overcoming despair was needed and strengthening state institutions was crucial for national unity and stability.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
