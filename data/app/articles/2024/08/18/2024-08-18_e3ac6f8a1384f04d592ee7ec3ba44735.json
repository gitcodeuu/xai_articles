  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 18 (APP):A child on Sunday died after falling into an open drain in Khanna East area, sparking outrage among local residents who have warned the district administration of blocking the highway if construction of the drain does not commence soon.\nThe police talking to APP said that  the incident occurred in Khanna East, an area plagued by open drains and deteriorating infrastructure.\nDespite multiple incidents in the past where citizens have fallen into these drains and sustained injuries, the authorities have failed to address the issue.\nFor over 10 years, residents of the area have repeatedly submitted written requests and held meetings with officials, including National Assembly members Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Raja Khurram Nawaz, but the problem remained unresolved. The locals are growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of action, stating that the situation has reached a breaking point.\nMohammad Nasir Kiyani, General Secretary of the Islamabad Young Traders Organization, expressed deep sorrow over the incident. He mentioned that the deteriorating condition of roads and open drains is making it difficult for traders in Khanna East to conduct business.\nThe local community has now warned that if their concerns continue to be ignored, they will stage a protest on the highway.\nThey also plan to seek support from trade unions across the city to amplify their demands.\nThe residents are urging the authorities to take immediate action to address the issues, emphasizing the need for a swift resolution to prevent further tragedies.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
