When the then Chinese president visited Pakistan, he visited the industry in Lahore and was stunned to see the progress in Pakistan’s engineering sector. Pakistan gave a loan of 140 million dollars to Germany in 1967,” he said.\nHe added that since 1971 Pakistan continued its journey of development despite being facing separation.\nHe said that today our youth should work tirelessly to utilize the country’s resources. “We have progressed in every field, be it industrial sector or engineering. Be it sports or agriculture, Pakistan has raised flags of success in every field. The youth should realize that despair is disbelief. India, whose economy is 640 billion dollars, has 2.5 million citizens going abroad for jobs every year while 0.5mln of our citizens travel abroad for better employment. There is nothing wrong with that.”\nGul said that every citizen has to contribute to the development of the country like the citizens of other countries so that the name of our beloved motherland can shine.",
