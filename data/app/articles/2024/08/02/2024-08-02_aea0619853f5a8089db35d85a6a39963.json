  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 2 (APP): Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi made a surprise visit to Khanna Police Station, where he found the investigating officers absent from their offices, while complainants were present.\nThe duty sub-inspector was unable to respond to any questions and the front desk room smelled of cigarettes. Around 1500 motorcycles and several cars were parked at the police station.\nMohsin Naqvi expressed displeasure at the deplorable condition of the police station.\nHe visited the front desk, clerk’s room, and lockup and inquired about the cases of the accused in the lockup. He ordered the release of four individuals who were arrested for parking their carts in the wrong place after completing necessary legal proceedings.\nThe interior minister emphasized that there is no justification for parking such a large number of motorcycles in the police station. The motorcycles belong to citizens and must be returned to them.\nHe directed the immediate hearing of complainants and warned that making them wait unnecessarily would not be tolerated.\nChief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, was also present on the occasion.",
