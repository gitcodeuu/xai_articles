She recounted her journey through Beijing, Chengdu, Kashgar, and Urumqi, where she was deeply moved by the warmth and hospitality of the Uyghur people and their socio-economic development, which starkly contrasted with the negative portrayals often carried by the Western media.\nSenator Mushahid Hussain Sayed congratulated Naz Parveen for her exceptional work and commended the book for its communicative style and insightful content.
