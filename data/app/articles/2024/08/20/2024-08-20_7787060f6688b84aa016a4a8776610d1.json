All prior actions have been completed,” he assured.\nHe further said the government was doing all the efforts to support low-income electricity users.\nThe federal government has already reduced the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) and provided subsidies to low-income users consuming up to 200 units of electricity, he said.\nHe also praised the Punjab government’s initiative to protect users consuming between 201 and 500 units, suggesting that other provinces could follow suit using their National Finance Commission (NFC) allocations. “We will welcome any such initiatives,” he added.\nAddressing concerns about the temporary nature of these measures, he acknowledged that they are indeed short-term solutions but emphasized their importance.\n“Given the increased consumption during these two months, they have reduced the burden of additional bills,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
