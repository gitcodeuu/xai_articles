In a pioneering move, the Speaker of the Punjab Assembly has teamed up with the Pakistan Wildlife Foundation (PWF), Himalayan Wildlife Foundation, WWF-Pakistan, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB), and the AJK Wildlife Department to spearhead an ambitious conservation project aimed at revival of the Alexandrine parakeet.\nThe Alexandrine parakeet, scientifically known as Psittacula eupatria, is one of the largest parakeet species in the world, with adults measuring up to 40 centimeters in length. The parakeets are also known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities, which have been observed in both their wild and captive environments. This intelligence, coupled with their striking appearance, has made them popular pets, further intensifying the pressures of the illegal pet trade.\nThis vibrant species, crucial for its role in seed dispersal, forest regeneration, and maintaining ecological balance, has seen its numbers plummet due to habitat destruction, poaching, and the illegal wildlife trade. Rapid urbanization and deforestation have eradicated key nesting sites, particularly old trees with cavities essential for breeding. Additionally, the bird’s presence in markets across the Middle East has added to its decline, driven by a lucrative exotic pet trade that remains largely unregulated.\nIn response, the coalition has embarked on several strategic efforts. Restoration projects are underway to plant native tree species, creating vital nesting sites and food sources in areas most affected by habitat loss.\nThe Himalayan Wildlife Foundation has deployed local patrols around Deva Vatala National Park, effectively dismantling illegal poaching networks and arresting offenders.\nThe Psittacula Breeders Association, led by a prominent breeder, is committed to ethical breeding practices, ensuring adherence to conservation standards and distancing itself from the illegal wildlife trade.\nSafwan Shahab Ahmed, a leading conservationist, talking to APP highlighted the need for a targeted approach in Kasur district. He advocates for a concentrated effort involving civil administration, law enforcement, and relevant organizations rather than dispersing resources across multiple regions. This focused strategy aims to plant indigenous trees and combat poaching, promising more significant and sustainable outcomes.\nDespite these advances, challenges remain. Inconsistent enforcement of wildlife protection laws, especially in rural areas, continues to undermine conservation efforts. Enhanced collaboration between Pakistan and neighboring countries is crucial to tackle the illegal smuggling of parakeets, which persists as a major issue.\nMalik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, a dedicated advocate for nature conservation, has played a key role in rallying support from crucial law enforcement agencies, including the Pakistan Rangers, the Civil Administration of Kasur, and the Punjab Wildlife Department. His efforts have been pivotal in mobilizing these agencies against illegal poaching and ensuring their commitment to protecting the Alexandrine parakeet.\nThe conservation of the Alexandrine parakeet is a significant test of Pakistan’s dedication to preserving its biodiversity. Led by Safwan Shahab Ahmed and supported by a coalition of organizations, government figures, and local communities, these efforts represent a promising pathway to saving the species. By addressing the root causes of its decline and implementing effective strategies, there is hope for the parakeet’s recovery. This initiative serves as a model of collaborative conservation, aiming to ensure that the Alexandrine parakeet not only survives but thrives, contributing to broader biodiversity goals in Pakistan and beyond.\nAs Pakistan embarks on this ambitious conservation journey, the success of this initiative will not only determine the fate of the Alexandrine parakeet but will also reflect the nation’s dedication to preserving its rich biodiversity. Through collaborative effort and sustained action, there is renewed hope for the parakeet’s recovery and the broader goals of environmental conservation.",
