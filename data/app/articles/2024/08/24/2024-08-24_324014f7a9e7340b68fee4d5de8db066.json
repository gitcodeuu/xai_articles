  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 24 (APP): Executive Director of the State Bank of Pakistan, Syed Sohail Jawad, said on Saturday that the government intends to integrate overseas Pakistanis into the national system.\nTalking on PTV news, he mentioned that overseas Pakistanis faced problems related to sending money to families living in Pakistan, as it was a very expensive and time-consuming process.\nThe State Bank of Pakistan launched the Roshan Digital Account scheme under the National Payment Strategy designed to help those overseas Pakistanis with remittance-related issues, he added.\nHe stated that the government is committed to addressing remittance-related issues to boost the confidence of overseas Pakistanis, as these remittances account for approximately 8 to 9 percent of the economy.\nTo solve this problem, a Raast payment system based on international standards was adopted, he added.\nHe said that the government initiated collaboration with Buna which was backed by the 22 GCC Gulf countries.\nThe Buna-Raast connectivity project will facilitate overseas Pakistanis in Arab countries in sending remittances through a swift, affordable, and effective mechanism, he added.\nThe project would not only simplify the digital remittance process but also help boost Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves to approximately 5 to 6 billion dollars.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
