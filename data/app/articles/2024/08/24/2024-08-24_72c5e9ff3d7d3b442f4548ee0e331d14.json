Ms. Candler underlined the need for collective efforts and find solutions to improve situation of education in Pakistan for all, and reaffirmed UNHCR’s commitment to support the development of policies and programmes that benefit both refugee and host communities’ children.\nNaoaki Miyata, Country Chief of JICA said that Pakistan stands at a critical juncture where 67 percent of its population is under the age of 30. He added that JICA has been focusing on human capital development through enhancing access to quality education and this conference will pave the ways for advocating impactful measures through accelerated education policy in Pakistan to address the out-of-school challenges.\nSpeaking at the occasion, Sohail Akhtar Malik, Senior Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training, highlighted the urgency of the situation, including the declaration by prime minister of an education emergency, and underscored the need for adopting innovative, cost-effective solutions and approaches to provide right to education to out-of-school children especially through digital technology, namely through the acceleration learning programme.\nDuring the workshop, participants also shared good practices and efforts underway to address the education crisis, including Allama Iqbal Open University delivering ALP (Middle-Tech) to around 3,000 children across the country.\nProvincial level consultations will now get underway, followed by national technical level discussions in September with a goal to agree on a unified approach to accelerated education, ensuring these programmes are accredited and effectively support children in need, regardless of their status.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
