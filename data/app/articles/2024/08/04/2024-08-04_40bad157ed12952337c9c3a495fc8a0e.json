  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 4 (APP):Senior All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leaders from Azad Jammu and Kashmir Chapter on Sunday vowed that Kashmiris’ struggle for self-determination and freedom from Indian yoke will continue till its logical conclusion.\nTalking to APP,  APHC leaders Ghulam Mohammad Safi, Syed Yousaf Naseem and Advocate Pervaiz Shah termed the fascist Indian regime’s unilateral decision to abolish Article 370 and 35-A on Aug 5, 2019″ constitutional terrorism”.\nThey believed August 5 (Youm-e-Istehsal) was a day of exploitation, mourning and a black day for not only the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) but Kashmiris living all over the world.\nThey appealed to the United Nations, the international community, OIC, European Union and human rights organizations to take cognizance of the violations of human rights being committed in the state of Jammu and Kashmir by Indian occupation forces.\nThey said that India annexed  Kashmir by violating all the agreements and international law on August 5, 2019.\nThe convener of All Parties Hurriyat Conference AJK Chapter, Ghulam Mohammad Safi, said that India has been trying to justify its usurpation of Jammu and Kashmir since day one. In a cynical attempt to make Jammu and Kashmir a part of itself, the provisions included in the Constitution of India regarding the special status of Kashmir were abolished.\nOn August 5, 2019, India, he said the Modi government abolished the special semi autonomous status of Kashmir, and this day was now marked every year as Youm-e-Istehsal where voice was raised against oppression at every forum around the world. He said India had an illusion that after this move it had succeeded in its nefarious objectives and the special status of Kashmir has been abolished.\nHe said now under the conspiracy to change demography of the state, Kashmir’s land was being allotted to Indians and they were allowed to become citizens of Kashmir.\nMoreover Indian army was being allotted strategic areas and the Kashmiris were being deprived of their land. Encroachment is being done, the names of Muslim schools.\nHe said the curriculum was being changed and religious freedom was being abolished.\nAll Party Hurriyat Conference Azad Jammu Kashmir  Chapter Secretary General Advocate Pervez Shah said on August 5, 2019, India terminated the special status of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in violation of all international laws and the UN Charter, including the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.\nThis special status was given to Kashmir on the occasion of the formulation of the Constitution of India under the United Nations resolutions considering it as disputed territory, he added.\nIn this regard, an agreement was reached between the Kashmiri leadership of that time and the government of India, after which 35A was added, he maintained.\nHe said following the repeal of Article 35A and Article 370, over 43 lac state subjects were issued to non-Kashmiris to resettle them in Kashmir.\n“These measures aim to bring demographic change in Kashmir. We salute Kashmiris for not allowing India to succeed in its nefarious plans, this move is not accepted by either the Kashmiris or the international community,” he said.\nHe said that after failing in its plans, India started firing Kashmiris from their jobs. He said that BJP launched eight political parties in Kashmir in five years, but they could not get any candidate in the previous elections.\nKashmiris rejected all oppression and succeeded the human rights advocates like Engr Rasheed, Aga Ruhullah and such candidates who protested for the removal of Kashmir’s special status in the House. Building more than 50,000 temples in Kashmir did not help, he said.\nAs long as Kashmiris are alive, they will continue their struggle and one day Kashmir will be free, he said adding,\n“We are grateful to Pakistan for its political, diplomatic and moral support for Kashmir. We are grateful to Pakistani nation and the political parties for marking August 5 as Youm-e-Istehsal.”\nHurriyat leader Syed Yousuf Naseem termed August 5, 2019, as the darkest day in Jammu and Kashmir’s history.\nHe said on this day, the Indian government, having failed in its attempts to forcibly seize control of the Kashmir issue, unilaterally abrogated all past agreements and resolutions, including two dozen United Nations resolutions, the Simla Agreement, The Tashkent Declaration and The Lahore Declaration. India deployed over 1 million troops in Kashmir, thereby occupying the region, he said.\nHe said that on August 5, 2019, India abrogated Articles 35A and 370 of its constitution which was a constitutional terrorism by India. He said that the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, during an address at Lal Chowk, Srinagar had announced that the resolution of the Kashmir conflict would be done as per the wish of Kashmiris.\nHe had said India would not force Kashmiris to join India, they would decide through a free and fair plebiscite whether they want to join India or Pakistan.\nPakistan has been highlighting the Kashmir dispute as an advocate on every platform worldwide, he said and added that the Indian army has been imposed in Kashmir under black laws but it cannot usurp the state of Jammu and Kashmir through these coercive measures.\nHe said for Kashmiri masses August 5 was the day to renew pledge for the continuation of the freedom struggle till liberation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir from the illegal and immoral occupation of India.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
