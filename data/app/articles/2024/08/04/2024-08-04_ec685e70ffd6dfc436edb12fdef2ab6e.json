  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 04 (APP):The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)’s National Emergencies Operation Center anticipated that the latest hydrometeorological conditions suggest that high to very high-level flash flooding is likely in Balochistan.\nThe hill torrents of and local nullahs of Zhob, Kalat, Nasirabad and Sibbi divisions are likely to experience high to very high levels of flash flooding which may result in damage to infrastructure. Similarly, the hill torrents and local nullahs of D.G. Khan are likely to experience high to very high levels of flash flooding which may result in damage to infrastructure, a news release said.\nIt added that all villages and towns or settlements near nullahs, especially along the floodplain, can be affected by increased flows. On the Northern side, the catchment areas of Kabul River and its tributaries have received significant rainfall, which will likely result in medium to high floods in Nowshera as well as in the tributaries of River Kabul.\n“Medium to high flows in Nowshera may inundate low-lying areas and may cause damage to the infrastructure. The GLOF event in Chitral will also increase flows in the Panjkora River and ultimately in the Kabul River,” it said.\nThe NDMA has issued instructions to all relevant departments to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and extreme weather.\nThe population at risk is advised to avoid flood waters, find a safe location away from flood-prone areas and use alternative routes to avoid areas prone to flooding.\nThe NDMA has launched the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert application, available on Google Play Store and iOS App Store, to provide timely alerts, advisories, and guidelines to the public.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
