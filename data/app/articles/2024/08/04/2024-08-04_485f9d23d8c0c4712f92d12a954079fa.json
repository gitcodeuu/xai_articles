Indians wanted to change the only Muslim majority state into a minority which India has miserably failed.\nThe speakers said that after scrapping Article 370 in IIOJK, legislation was also passed regarding the targeting of minorities and the steps taken by India to promote the ideology of RSS and Hindutva but this narrative was broken.\nDirector AMBLEM School System, Lt. Col (r) Murtaza Ali Shah, emphasized the importance of Uswah-al-e-Hasanah as the sole path to achieving ultimate success. He highlighted that following the exemplary conduct and principles of Uswah-e-Hasanah provides a clear and definitive direction for individuals striving for meaningful and lasting accomplishments in life.\nLt. Col (r) Murtaza Ali Shah’s statement underscores the belief that true success is rooted in adhering to the moral and ethical standards set by Uswah-e-Hasanah. By embracing these values, individuals can navigate their personal and professional lives with a sense of purpose and integrity, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful existence.\nConvenor APHC AJK Ghulam Muhammad Safi said that the Indian government was trying to convince the world that Jammu and Kashmir was an undisputed part of its territory which was not true.\nHe maintained that India’s brutal and illegal occupation of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir was not only a violation of international laws, but also a mockery of internationally recognized principles of human rights.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
