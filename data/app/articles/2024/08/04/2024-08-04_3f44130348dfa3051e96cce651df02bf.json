  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 4 (APP):An academician, multi-disciplinary scholar and peace activist Dr Sheikh Waleed Rasool has criticized Indian political parties for their handling of the situation in Kashmir, accusing them of bullying and deceiving the Kashmiri people.\nAccording to Kashmir Media Service, Dr Sheikh Waleed Rasool in a media interview in connection with Youm-e-Istehsal-e-Kashmir, argued that the Indian government had sought to erode the property rights of Kashmiris and undermine their ability to self-govern.\nHe exposed the true face of Indian political parties in occupied Kashmir, adding the Indian government’s actions would not extinguish the Kashmiri people’s desire for freedom.\nHe said Youm-e-Istehsal will be observed to express the Kashmiri people’s rejection of India’s illegal occupation and to protest the Indian government’s decision on August 5, 2019, to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThis day serves as a reminder of the Kashmiris’ ongoing struggle for self-determination and their refusal to accept the Indian government’s unilateral actions, which they deem a violation of their rights and a threat to their identity, he said.\nTo a question, Dr Waleed Rasool strongly criticized the Modi government’s policies in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, particularly the imposition of Hindu nationalist ideology (Hindutva). He also condemned the government’s decision to change the names of places, languages and curriculum of students, which he sees as an attempt to erase the cultural identity and heritage of the Kashmiri people.\nHe said that even Hitler, notorious for his brutal suppression of minority groups, did not attempt to alter the cultural identity of the regions, as the Indian government is doing in Kashmir. He vehemently criticized the Indian government’s policies towards minority communities, particularly Muslims, Christians and other marginalized groups.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
