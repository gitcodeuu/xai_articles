  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 4 (APP):All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Information Secretary Mushtaq Ahmed Butt described August 5 as one of the most painful and agonizing days in Kashmir’s history.\nTalking to APP,  he said that on this day, the Modi regime, in severe violation of international laws, unconstitutionally abrogated the special status of the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir by repealing Articles 370 and 35A. This action split the state into two territories and turned it into an open prison, where ten million unarmed Kashmiris faced the oppressive presence of a million heavily armed Indian soldiers. The regime stripped the Kashmiri people of all their fundamental, political, religious, and social rights, dehumanizing them in the process.\nMushtaq Ahmed Butt stated that the Narendra Modi regime unleashed an unprecedented wave of oppression, arresting thousands of pro-freedom leaders and activists, who remain detained in distant Indian prisons. Hundreds of homes have been demolished, and numerous people have been dismissed from their government jobs. Freedom of expression has been heavily curtailed across social, electronic, and print media, creating an atmosphere of silence and fear throughout the state.\nIn today’s modern and digital world, Kashmir is experiencing rapid demographic changes, with efforts to erase its Muslim identity. People’s homes and lands are being confiscated, and non-state residents are being rapidly settled in Kashmir to transform it into a Hindu state.\nDespite these injustices, the Kashmiri people remain determined to continue their struggle for the right to self-determination until their goal is achieved. Mushtaq Ahmed Butt appealed to the international community, Islamic countries, and human rights organizations to take action against the increasing Indian atrocities in Kashmir. He urged them to declare all illegal measures taken by India as null and void, pressuring India to resolve the Kashmir issue in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and fulfill the promise of self-determination.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
