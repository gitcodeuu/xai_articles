  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 19 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has halted the Accountability Court’s decision on the 190 million pounds reference against the PTI founder, citing that the trial court’s proceedings are still ongoing.\nThe IHC division bench, comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Babar Sattar, heard the PTI founder’s petition and the registrar office’s objections.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, argued that the trial court had already testified 35 witnesses and that the cross-examination of the last witness, the NAB investigation officer, was still pending. The court noted that out of the eight individuals named in the reference, six were absconders, and the trial was only proceeding against two individuals.\nThe lawyer stated that the petitioner was accused of facilitating the 190 million pound scam, and that the NAB case claimed the amount was supposed to arrive in a bank but instead came into the Supreme Court’s account.\nThe court also observed that the Al-Qadir Trust was not a registered trust. The lawyer assured the court that they would provide information on this matter during the next hearing.\nThe reference was filed on December 1, 2023, and charges were framed on February 27. The court served notices to NAB and sought comments by Wednesday, warning the PTI founder’s lawyers not to use delaying tactics or the stay order would be withdrawn.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
