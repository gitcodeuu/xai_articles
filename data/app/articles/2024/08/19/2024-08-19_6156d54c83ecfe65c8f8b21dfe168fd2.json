  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 19 (APP): Pakistan has witnessed the first Super Blue Moon on Monday night offering a rare opportunity to the stargazers and space enthusiasts to enjoy this celestial treat.\nThe event occurred at 11:26pm in Pakistan, according to the national space agency-Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).\nThe Super Blue Moon left astronomy enthusiasts and photographers in awe while Suparco has also received an overwhelming response from the astrophotographers who took stunning photographs from across Pakistan.\nThe photographs not only highlighted the beauty of the moon but also demonstrated the talent and creativity of Pakistan’s astrophotography community.\nThis blue moon was the first supermoon of the year, with three more expected on September 18, October 17, and November 15.\nA supermoon happens when the moon is closest to Earth, at a distance of 363,300 kilometres, making it 30 percent brighter and 14 percent larger than usual. Although “supermoon” is not an official astronomical term, it describes a full moon that appears larger due to its proximity to Earth.\nThe term “blue moon” refers to the second full moon in a single calendar month, not its colour.\nThis year’s blue moon is classified as the third full moon in a season of four. The name can be misleading, but it reflects a rare alignment rather than an actual blue hue.\nAstronomers clarify that the name “blue moon” can also describe a seasonal occurrence, where it is the third full moon in a season that has four.\nTonight’s super blue moon offered a perfect opportunity for enthusiasts to enjoy a dazzling lunar display.",
