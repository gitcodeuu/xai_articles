She cautioned against trusting any messages from other numbers, as they are fraudulent.\nThe delegation requested that BISP coordinate with the minority communities in remote areas to ensure their enrollment in the program.\nSenator Rubina Khalid assured her full cooperation and directed BISP staff to take the necessary steps in this regard.",
