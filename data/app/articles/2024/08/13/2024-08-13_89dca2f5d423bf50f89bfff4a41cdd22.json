  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 13 (APP): In today’s world, the unseen yet powerful forces driving carbon emissions are not just shaping our environment but also jeopardizing our future.\nIn July 2023, an unprecedented heatwave gripped Europe and North America, pushing temperatures beyond 50°C (122°F). This extreme heat, driven by rising carbon emissions, fueled devastating wildfires and a severe public health crisis, highlighting the urgent need for developed nations to address climate change and curb emissions effectively.\nHistorically, the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries marked a significant turning point with economic growth and technological advancement. However, it also led to a surge in carbon emissions due to the widespread use of coal and fossil fuels.\nThis period set the stage for the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and environmental consequences. According to “Nature Reviews Earth & Environment,” global CO2 emissions for 2022 increased by 1.5% relative to 2021 and by 2.0% relative to 2019, reaching 36.1 GT CO2. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 1.1% in 2023, hitting a record high of 37.4 billion tonnes, an increase of 490 MT from 2022. Coal emissions accounted for more than 65% of this rise. Major CO2 emitters include China, the EU, India, Japan, and the US.\nThe emissions from these countries significantly impact third-world nations, often feeding environmental and economic challenges. For instance, the adverse effects on low-income communities, especially in terms of health and economic stability, are substantial. To tackle these issues, various international agreements have been established.\nThe Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to about 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Pakistan, as a signatory, has also contributed to the Kyoto Protocol, which sets binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Developed countries are listed in the Annex, while developing countries, including Pakistan, India, China, and Brazil, are in the Non-Annex category.\nThe United Nations (UN) plays a vital role in climate change mitigation through various initiatives. The UN hosts the Conference of Parties (COP) for negotiations on climate action. Additionally, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) promotes global sustainable practices and policies. Evaluating how developed nations meet or fail their commitments under these agreements provides further insight into their roles and responsibilities.\nProfessor Sanabil Sibtain of Bahria University, an expert in Global Governance and Development, talking to APP highlighted the China Unified Carbon Market launched on July 16, 2021, which aims to help China meet its carbon reduction targets. India pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2070 at COP 26 in Glasgow. COP27 faced challenges where many countries prioritized energy security over aggressive emission reduction targets.\nProfessor Sibtain also discussed the Clean Energy House Programme introduced by the Pakistan government in 2018, designed to enhance environmental quality, green spaces, and carbon footprint awareness. Climate Justice events link climate crises to social, racial, and environmental issues, such as the disproportionate effects on low-income and BIPOC communities in California’s Bay Area Oil Corridor, underscoring the need for equitable solutions.\nAn often-overlooked aspect of climate change is the economic transition for industries dependent on fossil fuels. As countries move towards cleaner energy, it’s essential to support affected workers through retraining and economic diversification. This ensures those reliant on traditional energy sectors are not disproportionately impacted.\nAdditionally, advancing to a low-carbon economy requires innovation in renewable energy and international cooperation. Developed nations must lead by investing in green technologies and supporting global climate initiatives. Their active role in fulfilling climate commitments and fostering innovation is crucial for achieving long-term climate goals and ensuring a widely shared sustainable future.\nDeveloped nations have often failed to meet their carbon emission commitments, as seen in agreements like the Paris Accord. Their inconsistent adherence, driven by shifting political priorities and economic interests, complicates global climate action. This noncompliance prolongs environmental degradation badly affecting the poor and vulnerable countries.\nAddressing climate change demands not only environmental action but also a commitment to social and racial equity. Developed nations, with their historical and ongoing contributions to carbon emissions, carry significant responsibility. Incorporating Climate Justice principles into international agreements is essential for equitable outcomes and a sustainable future, particularly for the most affected countries.",
