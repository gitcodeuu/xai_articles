  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 13 (APP): As another gang of individuals possessing a highly radioactive and toxic substance Californium, worth US$ 100 million in quantity was arrested in India, Pakistan on Tuesday expressed its grave concerns over the reports of recurring incidents of theft and illicit sale of nuclear and other radioactive materials in the country.\nForeign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, in response to a question about the arrest of a gang in India with radioactive material, said that three incidents of theft of Californium were also reported in 2021. Last month, five individuals with a radioactive device reportedly stolen from Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) were also found in Dehradun, she added.\n“These recurring incidents call into question the measures taken by New Delhi for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material. These incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India,” she remarked.\nSpokesperson Baloch said that the international community sought an earnest disclosure from the Indian authorities as to how a sealed Radioactive Source (SRS) material, like Californium, was in the possession of the apprehended individuals.\n“It is dangerous for such sensitive material in India to be routinely found in the wrong hands. Pakistan reiterates its call for a thorough investigation of these incidents and for adequate measures to prevent their recurrence, the spokesperson added.",
