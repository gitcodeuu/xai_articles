Declaration.\nDuring the meeting, participating delegates affirmed their commitment to making all-out efforts and mobilizing political will to address gender inequality and empower women to achieve green economy goals in Asian countries.\nChair of the meeting and Coordinator to Prime Minister on Climate Change Romina Khurshid Alam, after the conclusion of the meeting of the 20 parliamentarians from different Asian countries, said, “Tackling causes of gender inequality and addressing them through political collaboration and cooperation among the parliamentarians of the Asian countries and development of regional policies and their implementation in true spirit is inevitable to boost women’s empowerment for achieving green economy goals.”\nAll participating parliamentarians from 20 Asian countries including Japan, Indonesia, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Cambodia, Jordan, Mongolia, Maldives and Egypt reiterated their support for the Prime Minister (PM) Shehbaz Sharif’s climate aide Romina Khurshid’s call to work together and assured their respective government’s the fullest support to improve socio-economic empowerment in all spheres of the life.\nThe two-day regional meeting was co-organised by the Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development (AFPPD) and the Asian Population and Development Association (APDA), with support from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) through the Japan Trust Fund (JTF).\nThe meeting also brought together more than 300 participants from, governments, international organizations, NGOs, youth organizations and academia, involving 20 countries, to share and discuss good practices in policies, legislation and programmes on The International Conference on Population and Development-30 (ICPD30), aiming to address gender equality, women empowerment and climate change.\nThe meeting agenda included deliberations on the policies, systems and services that could strengthen investment in youth and eliminate gender inequality, including through empowering women and girls and engaging them in decision-making processes.\nAddressing the media, PM’s climate aide Alam said, “It is deeply heartening to note that participating parliamentarians from the 20 Asian countries unanimously voted for the declaration, demonstrating political will and commitment of their respective governments to implement it letter and spirit for enhancing women’s empowerment in, among others, education, health, energy, water, agriculture, technology, research and industrial sectors for achieving the green economy goals.”\nShe warned that without achieving women’s empowerment and addressing gender equality in Asian countries, which are extremely vulnerable to climate risks, achieving the green economy goals was not possible.\n“Because, for being geared to support sustainable consumption and production, low-carbon economic growth, resource-conserving, diverse and circular, the green economy goals particularly focus on the socio-economic empowerment of women and tackling gender equality in all sectors of the economy and society,” PM’s climate aide emphasised, adding, “It embraces new models of sustainable and green economic development that address the challenge of creating prosperity within planetary boundaries.”\nSpelling out key causes of persisting gender inequality and inadequate women empowerment in societies in almost most Asian countries including Pakistan,  Romina Khurshid said that uneven access to education, uneven access to education lack of employment opportunities, job segregation, poor medical care, poor medical care, absence of pro-women empowerment and gender equality societal mindsets are among the key roadblocks to achieving the socio-economic women empowerment and gender equality.\nShe urged the parliamentarians from Asian countries, particularly those highly vulnerable to exacerbating climate risks and characterized by poor socio-economic empowerment and gender equality indicators to strengthen their role as legislators to deal with the drivers of the gender inequality and poor representation of women in socio-economic sectors.\n12–point Islamabad Declaration on Gender Empowerment for Green Economy\nIn line with our role as parliamentarians,
