  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 13 (APP):Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar has extended warm congratulations to the nation and overseas Pakistanis on the occasion of Pakistan’s 77th Independence Day and said that the Day reminds us relentless determination of our forefathers, led by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who established a separate homeland where every citizen regardless of faith, ethnicity, or background could live with dignity and freedom.\nIn a message on Tuesday, the federal minister said our national flag, with green representing the Muslim majority and white symbolizing the protection of religious minorities, embodies our unwavering commitment to unity in diversity. As we commemorate this momentous day, we also reaffirm our steadfast support for the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their rightful struggle for self-determination.\nWe also strongly condemn Israel’s aggression in Gaza and term it a barbaric act and grave violation of human rights. Pakistan stands in unyielding solidarity with the people of Palestine, he said.\nOn this significant day, the minister said let us renew our collective resolve to build a society where rule of law and justice, equality and human dignity are paramount.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
