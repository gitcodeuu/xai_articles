It has been said in the resolution that it should be kept in mind that the United Nations has passed several resolutions on the Kashmir dispute. The House reiterates its unwavering moral, political and diplomatic support to the struggle of the Kashmiri people for the right to self-determination and pays tribute to the courage and bravery of the Kashmiri people,” he added.\nThe resolution further stated that this House reiterated its rejection of unilateral and illegal actions taken by India since August 5, 2019 and was deeply concerned about its continued efforts to change the demographic structure and political landscape of IIOJK.\n“This House emphasizes that any political process under the Indian Constitution cannot be a substitute for the exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of Jammu and Kashmir, as defined in the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The resolution has expressed serious concern over the presence of millions of Indian forces, which has made India’s illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir one of the most militarized regions in the world.\nThe resolution states that this House condemns the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir and expresses deep concern over the continued imprisonment of thousands of Kashmiri political prisoners.\nThis House condemns the impunity with which the Indian forces continue to commit human rights violations in the illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir under the usurpation laws that deny justice,” the Minister said.\nHe also mentioned that the resolution further stated that this House rejected the irresponsible statements of Indian leaders regarding Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, which were a threat to regional peace and stability. “The Pakistani nation will not allow any aggressive action to be thwarted and reiterates the unwavering commitment of supporting the Kashmiris indigenous freedom struggle,” he added.\nDuring her point of order, MNA Shazia Marri of Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) said that she regretted that MNA Achakzai opposed the Kashmir Resolution. “UN’s 1948 Resolution number 47 has a clear content that state that a plebiscite be held and Kashmiris facing Indian atrocities should be asked for their will to decide their fate. Kashmiris have not been able to get it so far,” she added.\nMarri underlined that it was not the matter of a territory but a humanitarian crisis where mass voices have been crushed blatantly by the occupant Indian forces in IIOJK. “We strongly condemn the human rights violations and abuses in IIOJK and will continue to condemn it,” she said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
