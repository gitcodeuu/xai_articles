If dengue larvae were found, the area was immediately sealed.\nMeanwhile, the business outlets were also shut down for failing to implement the required anti-dengue measures. These closures were part of a broader effort to ensure compliance with health regulations aimed at preventing the breeding of dengue-carrying mosquitoes, he added.\nOn the occasion, the DC emphasized the need for city-wide efforts to stop the growth of dengue larvae.
