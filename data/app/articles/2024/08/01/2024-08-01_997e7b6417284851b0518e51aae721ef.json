Among the first cohort of 20 graduates from 2023, more than 60 per cent of the participants secured jobs and internships in the public and private energy sectors.\nReflecting on the power of inclusion in fighting climate change, Acting Mission Director James Fleming said: “To address the world’s climate crisis, we need to harness the talents of everyone. Youth from diverse backgrounds – especially young women – bring fresh perspectives, skills, and talents to climate mitigation, where innovative and sustainable clean energy solutions are needed to transform the high-emitting global energy sector.”\nIn addition to the program, USAID is hosting a career expo for STEM graduates to network with national and international companies to explore career opportunities.",
