  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 01 (APP):The International Labor Organization (ILO) is committed to ensure that all children, particularly those at risk from child labour, have safe and healthy working conditions, said ILO official Manawar Sultana here Thursday.\nShe said that the ILO was developing and implementing policies and programs that would support the transition to safe and healthy work for children. They are doing this by collaborating with governments, employers, civil society and other partners.\nWith the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7, the international community made a commitment to the elimination of child labour in all its forms by 2025, said Munawar Sultana and added, while much progress has been made in reducing child labour over the years, recent years have seen global trends reverse and now more than ever it is important to join forces to accelerate action towards ending child labour in all its forms.\nShe said that all stakeholders and media should create an awareness to eliminate the child labour across the country  on social media platforms.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
