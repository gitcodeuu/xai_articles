He emphasized that there was corruption in every sector during PTI regime.\n“We will once again bring the country out of darkness and make it free from terrorism along with the armed forces,” he said.\nMeanwhile, speaking on the occasion, Wajiha Qamar said that PTI is trying to put the judiciary and other institutions under pressure, while on the other hand, they are begging for NRO.\nShe said the armed forces have separated themselves from politics.
