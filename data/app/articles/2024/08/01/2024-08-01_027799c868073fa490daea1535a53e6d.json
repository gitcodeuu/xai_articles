  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 01 (APP): Leader of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Mustafa Kamal said that the issue of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) was not a political matter, rather some disgruntled elements were politicizing it for their vested interests.\nAddressing the joint press conference along with Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Attaullah Tarar after his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif here Thursday, the MQM-P leader said that over-billings in the electricity tariffs and the payment of non-development charges to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) were illegal.\nHe said that electricity supply was concern of the entire nation, whereas the rising inflation had diminished the common man’s affordability of electricity that further aggravated the depleting economic situation.\nHe said that the electricity consumers of 200 units were given a subsidy of Rs 50 billion for three months by the government. However, the economic reforms agenda aims at creating fiscal space to make electricity cheaper for the poor consumers, he added.",
