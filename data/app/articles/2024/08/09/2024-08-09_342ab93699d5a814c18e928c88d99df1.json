She also instructed the women to visit the office to collect their money only after receiving a message from 8171.\nSenator Rubina Khalid planted a sapling under the Benazir Plantation Campaign in the lawn of the District Office in Mardan and prayed for the prosperity of the country.\nAddressing a public gathering at Gulli Bagh, Senator Rubina Khalid emphasized that the BISP provides educational stipends to the children of deserving families under the Benazir Taleemi Wazaif Program, with more scholarships allocated for girls’ education. Under Benazir Nashonuma, pregnant women and infants are provided with cash grants and nutritious food.\nAdditionally, a unique skills program is being launched for deserving women and their family members to help reduce poverty among these families.\nSenator Rubina Khalid also addressed the misconception that the program is creating dependency, stating that the BISP is providing additional financial support to alleviate the economic hardships of poor families.\nIn her address to a gathering of women, Senator Rubina Khalid highlighted that Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto laid the foundation of this program for the economic empowerment of poor women in the country while in exile in Dubai.\nThe program was implemented by President Asif Ali Zardari in 2008.\nShe informed the women that there is no fee to participate in the BISP survey and that dynamic registry centers have been established in tehsil offices for enrollment in the program.\nShe advised the women to ensure that they complete the necessary documentation to avoid any issues during the survey process.",
