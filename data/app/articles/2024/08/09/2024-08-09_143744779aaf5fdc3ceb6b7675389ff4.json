  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 09 (APP):The Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Commission (SUPARCO) has revealed that the earth planet is surrounded by a solar storm.\nGeomagnetic storms are on Earth’s path due to material and energy emitted from the Sun while satellites, power grids and space stations are at risk.\nThe Institute of Space Technology Islamabad has released special images of the surface of the Sun.\nAccording to the Spokesperson of SUPARCO, three Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are currently on their way to Earth.\nThe first two M-class solar flares were launched on August 07.\nInitial CMEs were relatively minor, but the third X1.3-class solar flare is much more powerful than these\nMore M-class flares have been released from the surface of the Sun.\nThe effects of plasma and magnetic waves from the Sun’s surface are expected to reach Earth over the next three to four days.\nAs the sun reaches the peak of its activity, earth also faces risks related to storms.\nSolar storms cause radio blackouts, disabled satellites, and cellular phone and GPS networks.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
