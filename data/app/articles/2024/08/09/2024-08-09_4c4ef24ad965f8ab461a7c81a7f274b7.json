  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 9 (APP): As the 16th martyrdom anniversary of Shaheed-e-Azeemat Shaikh Abdul Aziz approaches, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) and other pro-freedom organizations in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) are coming together to honor the legacy of this iconic Kashmiri leader, whose contributions to the struggle for self-determination remain etched in the annals of history.\nShaikh Aziz was martyred by Indian troops on August 11, 2008, while he was leading a massive march to Azad Kashmir in protest against the economic blockade of the Kashmir Valley imposed by Hindutva extremists in Jammu. His death became a rallying point for Kashmiris, further intensifying the resistance against the oppressive Indian occupation, said a press release issued on Friday.\nThe APHC has called for special prayer meetings on Sunday to commemorate the martyrdom of Shaikh Abdul Aziz and others who have sacrificed their lives for the Kashmiri cause. “His enduring legacy continues to inspire and fortify the resolve of those fighting for the rights and dignity of the Kashmiri people”, the APHC added.\nA coalition of voices within the APHC, including leaders like Ghulam Muhammad Khan Sopori, Syed Bashir Andrabi, Khawaja Firdous, Muhammad Yousuf Naqash, Javaid Ahmed Mir, Abdul Samad Inqilabi, Sleem Zargar, Maulana Musaib Nadvi, Muhammad Iqbal Mir, Yasmeen Raja, Ghulam Nabi War and others, along with organizations such as the Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party, Jammu and Kashmir Muslim League, Jammu and Kashmir National Front, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Freedom League and Kashmir Students Youth Forum, have pledged to continue the struggle until the complete liberation of Kashmir is achieved. They emphasized that the sacrifices made by Aziz and his associates during the 2008 uprising will never be forgotten.\nIn Srinagar, posters commemorating Shaikh Aziz serve as a powerful reminder of his courage, boldness, and unwavering commitment. These visual tributes reinforce his decision to embrace martyrdom rather than surrender, solidifying his status as a beacon of resistance against oppressive forces. The posters also underscore the collective determination of Kashmiris to persist in their struggle for freedom until they achieve their ultimate goal.\nThe message from these posters is clear: the Indian government’s attempts to crush the spirit of Kashmiris through massacres, oppression, and arrests are in vain. The resolve for freedom burns stronger than ever, with the sacrifices of martyrs like Shaikh Abdul Aziz continuing to fuel the movement toward ultimate victory.",
