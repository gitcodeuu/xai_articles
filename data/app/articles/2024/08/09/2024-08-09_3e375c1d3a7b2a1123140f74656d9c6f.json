The NHA encouraged the public to take advantage of this opportunity and requested them to obtain their\nM-Tags free of charge as soon as possible, said a press release issued by the NHA on Friday.\nIn the initial phase of implementation, M-Tags will be mandatory for the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway (M-11) starting\nAugust 16, 2024. Gradually, M-Tag will be mandatory for the vehicles plying on any of the motorways.\nThe NHA authorities highlighted that the M-Tag system not only saves time but also reduced costs for travelers. Additionally, this system ensured that public funds are handled  through transparent digital transactions.\nIn order to facilitate ease of access, the NHA has established multiple options for recharging M-Tags, including Customer Care Services, drive-through booths, and service areas, where payments can be made via credit/debit cards, EasyPaisa, and JazzCash.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
