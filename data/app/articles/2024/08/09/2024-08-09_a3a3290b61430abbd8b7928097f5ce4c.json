Inspired by Chinese wisdom and principles of peaceful coexistence, the GCI, introduced by President Xi Jinping in March 2023, focuses on respect for diversity, mutual learning, innovation, and people-to-people exchanges. These initiatives aim to foster lasting peace, stability, and development, with Pakistan being an early supporter, he added.\nSohail Mahmood reiterated the significance of cultural integration and social bonding for global progress, and quoted President Xi Jinping as saying “A single flower does not make spring, while one hundred flowers in full bloom bring spring to the garden.”\nThe keynote speaker, Masood Khalid, Pakistan’s former Ambassador to China, reflected on China’s integrated approach to global governance through the GDI, GSI, and GCI. He highlighted how these initiatives offer strategic guidance for building a global community with a shared future, embracing changes, and addressing challenges faced by humanity.\nHe also emphasized Pakistan’s steadfast support for China’s initiatives, acknowledging the deep-rooted and mutually beneficial relationship between the two nations.\nMs. Xiang Yang, Director of the China Study Centre at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST), shared insights into the practical application of the GCI principles. She discussed the collaborative efforts between China and Pakistan in cultural exchange and innovation, highlighting initiatives such as the establishment of Zhenghe College at NUST, which symbolizes the historical and ongoing cultural exchanges between the two countries.\nDr. Tahir Mumtaz Awan, Director of the China Study Centre at COMSATS University, focused on the significance of the GCI from the perspectives of China, Pakistan, and the broader region. He emphasized the need for Pakistan to align with the global narrative of peaceful development and leverage the GCI to deepen its relationship with China.\nHe called for enhanced cultural diplomacy, media collaborations, and educational exchanges to strengthen the bilateral ties between Pakistan and China.\nDr. Yasir Masood, Senior Research Fellow at China Global Television Network (CGTN), shared his insights on the GCI as an extension of China’s vision for a harmonious and multipolar world order. He highlighted the importance of the GCI in fostering mutual respect and learning among civilizations, while moving away from the zero-sum tactics of the past.\nYang Nuo, Minister Counsellor at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, praised the Institute of Strategic Studies for organizing the seminar on the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI). He emphasized the significance of Xi Jinping’s initiatives, including the GCI, Global Security Initiative (GSI), and Global Development Initiative (GDI), amidst global challenges like economic struggles and cultural clashes.\nYang highlighted China’s commitment to promoting cultural exchanges, fostering harmony, and supporting joint efforts with Pakistan in cultural heritage conservation. He stressed the importance of civilizational exchanges for global harmony and noted that the Chinese Embassy is working to build a China-Pakistan community as a model for the region and the world.\nEarlier, in his opening remarks, Dr. Talat Shabbir, Director of the China-Pakistan Study Centre at ISSI, highlighted the GCI as a call for a more inclusive and connected global community. He outlined its four key principles: respect for diverse civilizations, common human values, innovation, and people-to-people exchanges.\nHe emphasized that the GCI promotes a global environment where modernization is a collective goal, respecting and supporting each country’s unique path.",
