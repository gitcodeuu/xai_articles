  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 09 (APP):The Government of Pakistan has presented its progress on the Implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).\nThis review included a detailed response to the list of themes highlighted in the combined 24th to 26th periodic report by the CERD Committee, underscoring Pakistan’s continued dedication to addressing racial discrimination and its efforts to align with international human rights standards.\nThe delegation comprises Allah Dino Khwaja, Secretary Ministry of Human Rights, Samina Zahri, Chairperson of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights and Ambassador Bilal Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to Geneva. Their participation signified the government’s dedication to addressing racial discrimination and advancing human rights globally.\nDuring the review, the delegation provided comprehensive updates on significant progress since the last review in 2016. A major milestone has the integration of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), ensuring a uniform application of laws and the Constitution across the region. This step directly addressed a key observation made by the Committee during the previous review.\nIn line with the Committee’s recommendations, Pakistan successfully completed its first-ever digital census in 2023, with the country’s population now estimated at approximately 241 million. Notably, the population of key religious minorities, including Hindus and Christians, has shown an increase, reflecting the government’s commitment to inclusivity and equality.\nThe National Human Rights Institution has also been strengthened, with the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) recently accredited as an A-status institution by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI). Between 2018 and 2023, the NCHR received 2,455 complaints, of which 2,301 have been resolved, showcasing the institution’s effectiveness in addressing human rights concerns.\nThe report further detailed Pakistan’s efforts to combat hate speech, with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) registering 85 cases of hate speech in 2023, and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) initiating over 4,000 requests to international social media companies to block content targeting minorities.\nAdditionally, the government has undertaken significant legal and policy reforms to protect minority rights. This includes the enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act 2017, the Christian Marriage (Amendment) Act 2024, and the Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act 2018.\nThe government has also taken measures to prevent the misuse of blasphemy laws and has ensured robust protections for religious minorities. For example, in Punjab, 364 security personnel have been permanently assigned to protect places of worship, while in Sindh, PKR 900 million has been allocated for the renovation of Hindu temples.\nPakistan’s commitment to hosting Afghan refugees has also been highlighted during the review, emphasizing the country’s longstanding generosity despite economic and security challenges. The recent visit of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, in July 2024, further underscored Pakistan’s dedication to working with the international community on this issue.\nAs the review continues, the Government of Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to upholding the principles of the ICERD and to advancing human rights for all its citizens. The dialogue with the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination remains a critical component of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to build a fair and just society.",
