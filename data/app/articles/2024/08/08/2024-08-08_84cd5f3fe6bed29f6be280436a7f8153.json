  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 8 (APP):Additional Director General Health Services EPI, Dr. Samra Khurram said on Thursday that the authorities are leaving no stone unturned in their quest to make Pakistan a polio-free country saying that a comprehensive review of the existing polio drive strategy is underway with experts.\nIn an exclusive Interview with PTV news channel, she assured that the government’s determination to end polio is evident in its proactive approach where every possible measure is being taken to enhance the efficacy of the polio vaccination campaigns.\nBy leveraging the expertise of researchers and stakeholders, the government aims to plug the gaps in the system and ensure that no child is left unprotected against this debilitating disease, she added.\nWith renewed commitment and a robust strategy, Pakistan is poised to make a decisive push towards a polio-free future, she mentioned.\nDr. Samra Khurram also expressed her deep concern over the persistence of polio cases in Pakistan, despite the government’s efforts to eradicate the disease.\n“It is a tragedy that children in Pakistan continue to fall prey to a disease that can be easily prevented with a vaccine that the government brings to people’s doorsteps,” she lamented.\nShe emphasized that the polio vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect children from the debilitating effects of polio.   She urged parents to take responsibility for ensuring that their children receive the full course of vaccination, as prescribed by the government’s vaccination schedule.\nHer appeal to parents comes at a critical time, as Pakistan continues to grapple with the challenge of polio eradication. By ensuring that their children are fully vaccinated, parents can play a vital role in protecting them from the lifelong consequences of polio, and helping Pakistan move closer to a polio-free future.\nResponding a query, she mentioned the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health in Islamabad has confirmed the detection of WPV1 in a child from Miani UC of Chakwal.\nThe affected child showed symptoms of paralysis on July 16 and subsequent testing confirmed polio virus infection, she added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
