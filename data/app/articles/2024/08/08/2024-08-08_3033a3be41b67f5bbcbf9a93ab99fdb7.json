  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 08 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday clubbed the petition against arrest of PTI founder and his wife Bushra Bibi with identical cases.\nThe court sent the case file to chief justice to fix it before the available bench for hearing. A two-judge bench comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Auragzeb and Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the petition against the arrest of PTI founder and his wife in new toshakhana case.\nThe court noted that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has stated in its answer that PTI founder has refused to join the investigation in new toshakhana reference. It is unacceptable if the accused denied cooperation.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer said that the trial court didn’t grant interim bail to his clients in the matter rather it served notices to the respondents. The NAB arrested the petitioners despite the notice of the trial court, he said.\nThe court said that an identical case was already pending with IHC. The court said that it is sending the matter to the chief justice who would decide the bench to hear this case.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
