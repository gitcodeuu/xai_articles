  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 08 (APP):Pulmonologist/Lung Specialist Dr Matiur Rehman of Ali Medical Hospital ay advised parents to educate their children about the dangers of smoking and passive smoking and help them improve their quality of life.\nTalking  to APP scribe on Thursday, he said that Children who breathe passive smoking may have weaker and more sensitive lungs, leading to respiratory distress.\nHe further added that the Pakistan currently holds the highest proportion of young people, as 64% of the total population of Pakistan is below the age of 30. While 29% is between the ages of 15 and 29 years. Approximately, 1200 children initiate smoking every day in Pakistan. This number is growing rapidly every year and as responsible citizens and stakeholders we must all take action to protect our future generations from addiction .\nThese children can also have symptoms such as coughing, excess phlegm, wheezing, and breathlessness. Children whose parents smoke around them are more prone to bronchitis and pneumonia.\n“Passive smoking can cause asthma-like breathing problems without an official diagnosis, where the bronchial tubes swell, making it difficult for the child to breathe”, he added.\nThe primary causes of mortality for children under 5 years of age are varied. The top causes include neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections.\nHe further added that the Tobacco is deadly and tobacco-related illnesses are a significant burden on healthcare systems, annually taking lives of around 166,000 people in Pakistan.\nSo reducing tobacco consumption can alleviate some of this burden, freeing up resources for other areas of healthcare,he added.\nChildren who are exposed to passive smoking from their mother, father, or anyone else in the family have a greater chance of dying from SIDS during the first year of life than children who are not around secondhand smoke.\nDr Matiur Rehman has also said that “It is imperative to quit smoking and keep the home smoke-free. Don’t allow any relatives or visitors to smoke at home.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
