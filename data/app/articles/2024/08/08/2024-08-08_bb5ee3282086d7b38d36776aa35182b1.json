  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 08 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif Thursday urged the Ulema and Mashaikh to play an active role in countering propaganda, fake news, and disinformation, while aligning with core Islamic values and principles.\nHe stressed the significance of the role of Ulema and Mashaikh in guiding youth towards understanding the Quran, Sunnah, and character building, alongside academic knowledge and technical skills.\nHe was speaking to a large gathering of esteemed Islamic scholars (Ulema o Mashaikh) from diverse schools of thought convened at the Pakistan-China Friendship Center here for the National Ulema Convention. The prime minister graced the occasion as the Chief Guest, while the Chief of the Army Staff, General Syed Asim Munir NI(M), was the Guest of Honor.\nIn his address, the prime minister emphasized, “Islam is a religion of peace, and peace is the foundation of Islam. It teaches us coexistence, not confrontation. We must uphold these Islamic values firmly.” He further remarked, “Pakistan is a nation built on the principles of love, compassion, and acceptance. Our diversity, encompassing various cultures, religions, and ethnicities, is our strength. Let us embrace our differences and celebrate our unique identities.”\nHe also paid tribute to the brave security forces and law enforcement agencies, saying, “We salute those who risk their lives daily to protect the nation, offering the highest sacrifice for the motherland. We honor the sacrifices of our martyrs, who have given their lives to defend the nation.”\nIn his address, the Chief of the Army Staff stated, “We stand united and resolute in our commitment to eradicate terrorism from our soil. We will not tolerate extremism, violence, or fear-mongering.” He condemned “twisted ideologies that seek to divide us, senseless killings that aim to intimidate us, and inhumane tactics employed by Fitna Al Khawarij (FAK) that attempt to break our spirit.”\nHe emphasized, “Let us strive for a Pakistan where everyone can thrive in peace and prosperity. We are one nation, one people, and together we can achieve greatness.” He acknowledged the vital role of Ulema in promoting peace, tolerance, and inclusivity, countering extremist narratives, and educating society to reject hate and violence.\nThe forum unanimously expressed deep anguish over the ongoing brutalities against Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and the inhumane conflict in Gaza, terming these as crimes against humanity.",
