  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 8 (APP):Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) senior leader Khurram Dastgir on Thursday praised that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)’s respect for institutions is rooted in its belief in the importance of democratic norms and the rule of law.\nTalking to a private news channel, Dasgir argued that this approach has allowed the party to maintain a positive relationship with the army and other institutions, even when they have been in opposition.\nOn the other hand he criticised that the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had set up precedent of taking U-turns and maligned the state institutions’ image solely for his personal gains.\nDastgir’s scathing remarks exposed the PTI leader’s alleged hypocrisy and self-serving agenda and argued that such flip-flopping has become a hallmark of the PTI’s politics, undermining the trust of the people and the integrity of the political process.\nDastgir urged the people to recognize this reality and reject the PTI’s divisive and negative politics, which have hindered Pakistan’s progress and stability.\nThe PML-N leader questioned the PTI founder’s credibility, asking how someone who has consistently denounced the establishment can now seeking their favor.\nDastgir reaffirmed the PML-N’s commitment to serving the people and promoting democratic values, rather than pursuing power at any cost.\nHe alleged that PTI’s leadership has consistently employed divisive tactics, exploiting sensitive issues and fueling hatred to create a rift among the people.\n“PTI’s sole focus on gaining power has led them to abandon all sense of civility and decency, causing harm to the country’s social fabric and democratic norms”, he added.\nDastgir emphasized that PML-N, on the other hand, believes in inclusive politics and respectful dialogue, and will continue to promote a culture of tolerance and civility in politics.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
