  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 5 (APP): Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources Shahadat Awan on Monday said that Pakistan was the third largest country in the world in terms of extracting underground water.\nChairing the meeting of the Committee, he said “we as nation extract 9 percent of the total groundwater of the world, consequently making the ratio of recharge of ground water much lesser than its extraction.” “On the other hand, one third of natural water of Pakistan is wasted in the sea,” he said.\nBriefing the Committee on groundwater depletion in the country, DG PCRWR Dr. Hifza Rasheed said in Punjab, it was reported that the depth to the water table ranges from 5 to 140 feet. However, the Secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources interrupted and contested these figures, prompting the Chairman Awan to express his astonishment and annoyance.\nHe questioned how the committee could proceed with inaccurate data if the Ministry itself acknowledged the discrepancies therein.\nThe Chairman of the Committee highlighted that even the data concerning the capital city was flawed, while raising concerns about the accuracy of information for Punjab and Sindh provinces.\nThe Secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources attributed the inaccuracies to malfunctioning of piezometers and misreporting by the WASA.\nSenator Muhammad Humayun Mohmand inquired about the responsibility of the installation and maintenance of piezometers, to which it was clarified that this duty falls under the ambit of Irrigation Departments of concerned provinces. The Secretary further stated that the accurate data could not be provided until sufficient piezometers are placed/installed. Upon that, the Chairman Committee pointed out that the briefing had already included data from the reliable sources such as the PCRWR, Punjab Irrigation Department, and Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.\nThe Chairman lamented the inaccurate data presented by the Ministry before the Committee. With this the meeting was adjourned with a directive to the Ministry to conduct an internal review with all relevant departments responsible for data collection on this critical issue before re-presentation of the same before the Committee in its next meeting.\nThe meeting was attended by Senators Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, Poonjo Bheel and other senior officials of concerned departments.",
