  "content": "MULTAN, Aug 05 (APP):Chairman Kashmir Committee and former Speaker  National Assembly, Syed Fakhar Imam, stated that by illegally occupying Kashmir in violation of its own constitution, India had shown the world that it was a brutal nation.\nIn statement issued here in connection with Kashmir Exploitation Day on Monday, he informed that  recently, the International Court of Justice (ICJ)  ruled that what Israel was doing in Palestine was illegal, and India was doing the same in IIOJK.\nThe ICJ should take action against the atrocities committed by India in Kashmir and play its part in delivering justice to the Kashmiris.\nThe hearts of Kashmiris beat with Pakistanis and  we are one soul in two bodies, he said adding  Pakistan is incomplete without Kashmir.\nDue to China’s efforts, two meetings of the United Nations Security Council were held after 57 years, which proved that Kashmir was a disputed territory that India, in the context of the Shimla Agreement, called a regional issue.\nEx Chairman Kashmir Committee explained that with China’s cooperation, the Kashmir issue was highlighted internationally as a global issue. Debates on the Kashmir issue have taken place in major parliaments around the world, including the European Parliament. India has faced diplomatic, political, and moral defeat on all fronts. This is a significant achievement for Pakistan and the Kashmiris.\nOn Kashmir Exploitation Day, Syed Fakhar Imam further said that despite the severe curfew in Kashmir for the past five years, the courage of the Kashmiris has not waned and they are still standing firm against the 900,000 Indian soldiers.\nThey are fighting their own war for freedom Pakistan has always stood with the Kashmiris and will continue to provide moral, diplomatic and political support until the Kashmiris get their rights, he remarked.\nHe stated that Kashmir was the jugular vein of Pakistan and the  Kashmiris were fighting for their survival, and, God willing, they will succeed.\nHe added that the five-year curfew in Kashmir has made life unbearable, causing economic losses amounting to billions. The world must resolve the Kashmir issue according to the wishes of the Kashmiris.\nThe United Nations should implement its resolutions and grant the Kashmiris the right to self-determination, the statement  concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
