He denounced the move as a “crime against humanity” aimed at erasing the Kashmiri identity.\nThe minister praised the resilience of the Kashmiri people, highlighting the ongoing extrajudicial killings, arrests of leaders, and the region’s transformation into the “world’s biggest prison.” He urged the international community to address the crisis and support the Kashmir cause.\nNaqvi assured that Pakistan would continue to stand with the Kashmiri people, offering moral, political, and diplomatic support. He expressed hope for their eventual freedom, condemning India’s actions as violations of human rights and international law.",
