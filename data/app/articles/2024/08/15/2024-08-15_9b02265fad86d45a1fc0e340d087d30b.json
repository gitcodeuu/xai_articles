This is in response to a dual crisis in Pakistan’s education – 26.2 million children are currently out of school and 4 out of 5 children cannot read with comprehension by the age of 10.\nEducation is the bedrock of national development and the government has signalled its determination to tackle this issue, including through the formation of a high-level task force on the education emergency, led by the Prime Minister.\nThe MoFEPT is deploying a range of actions to tackle this crisis – including education technology, teacher education reform, assessment reform and addressing foundational learning – all of which were showcased at this event.\nThe event sees the launch of two major reports. Firstly, the MoFEPT and EdTech Hub launched the report, ‘Elevating Education at High Altitude: EdTech implementation in Gilgit-Baltistan’.\nThe presentation, by EdTech Hub’s Innovation Specialist, Nawaz Aslam, focussed on how educational reforms, particularly related to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) and Smart Schools interventions, were designed to help overcome some of the implementation challenges posed by Gilgit-Baltistan’s rugged terrain and socio-economic constraints.\nEducation reform was a particular triumph of the now Federal Secretary of Education, Mohyuddin Wani, when he was Chief Secretary, Gilgit-Baltistan. This was followed by reflection on EdTech implementation on the ground by leading EdTech entrepreneur Sajjad Haider of GBee TechHive.\nSecondly, the education ministry launched Pakistan’s first ever Foundational Learning Landscape Analysis, developed by the MoFEPT’s unit the Pakistan Foundational Learning Hub.\nThis follows the recent launch of the Federal Policy to ensure all children acquire basic skills in reading and mathematics. Project Director PFL Hub, Sam Wilson and Senior Associate, Research Dr. Zainab Salim provided important evidence insights into the causes of Pakistan’s learning crisis and what can be done to improve foundational skills.\nThis was followed by reflections on foundational learning from globally renowned scholar Dr. Tahir Andrabi, inaugural Dean of LUMS School of Education and Professor of Economics at Pomona College, whose work on the longitudinal LEAPS study is one of the most significant bodies of evidence on learning in South Asia.\nIn addition the MoFEPT event highlighted two crucial areas of reform: teacher education and assessment. The MoFEPT’s latest teacher education programme, the National Institute of Excellence in Teacher Education provides an induction and continuous Professional Development Program (CPD) tailored for today’s educators.\nNIETE Manager, Mahnoor Tanweer Butt, highlighted the aim to equip teachers with advanced pedagogical skills and content mastery through a state-of-the-art digital ecosystem.\nSimilarly, significant reforms are underway at the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education including recent improvements in the content and administration of exams. Chairman, FBISE, Syed Junaid Akhlaq presented a range of key reforms in this area.\nMohyuddin Wani concluded the event with the message for partners to tackle the education emergency, stating, “This is a great opportunity for us to highlight key research initiatives and interventions undertaken by the MoFEPT and to make collaborative efforts to address the gaps in children’s learning outcomes.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
