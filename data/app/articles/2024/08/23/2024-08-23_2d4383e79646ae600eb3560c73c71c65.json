  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 23 (APP):The International Rescue Committee (IRC) Pakistan marked a significant milestone on Friday with the inauguration of a rehabilitated large-scale water supply scheme and improved WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) infrastructure in schools across the Badin district, Sindh.\nThese initiatives are a crucial component of IRC’s ongoing post-flood recovery efforts, aimed at supporting communities impacted by the devastating 2022 floods in Pakistan, a news release said.\nThe rehabilitated water supply scheme is set to benefit over 1,500 households, providing much-needed access to clean water that was severely disrupted by the floods. Key improvements include the solarization of the system, the installation of a high-efficiency water pump, the construction of accessible pathways for use during flooding, and the reinforcement of a retaining wall to protect the water sources. The Water Supply Scheme was inaugurated by Sabir Ali Memon, Director Technical PHED, and Yasmeen Shah, Member of the Provincial Assembly.\nIn his remarks, Sabir Ali Memon emphasized the importance of rehabilitating the water supply scheme for the resilience of the community.\nHe assured that with the scheme now handed over to PHED, its ongoing operations and maintenance would be prioritized, ensuring reliable access to clean water that will support the community’s health and development for years to come.\nIn addition, a rehabilitated WASH infrastructure at the Government Girls Primary School was also inaugurated. This includes the installation of a borehole with a solarized water pump, construction of pathways for accessibility, establishment of a boundary wall, and refurbishment of facilities. These improvements are crucial in promoting the health, hygiene, and educational outcomes for girls, addressing the challenges that often lead to school dropout rates due to inadequate WASH facilities.\nYasmeen Shah said: “Ensuring access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities is not just about improving health and hygiene; it’s about empowering girls to stay in school and achieve their full potential. This intervention by IRC is a significant step towards creating an environment where our children, especially girls, can thrive.”\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony, IRC Provincial Head Shama Shaikh underscored the vital importance of WASH infrastructure in mitigating community vulnerability to climate impacts.\nShe emphasized that such infrastructure plays a key role in addressing gender disparities, enhancing health and education outcomes, and fostering economic inclusion. She also highlighted that climate-resilient WASH infrastructure is crucial not only for preparedness against climate-induced disasters but also for driving sustainable community development.\nSanullah Leghari, representative from the Rural Development Foundation, emphasized that these initiatives were driven by the local community’s needs, and upon completion, the community will take ownership and sustain these facilities.\nThe 2022 floods in Pakistan were among the worst in history, affecting one in seven of the population, resulting in loss of lives, livelihoods, and homes. Through the Disaster Emergency Committee’s (DEC) financial support, the International Rescue Committee Pakistan has, over the past two years, improved access to essential services, including clean water and healthcare, and supported livelihood restoration through training and grants, with an emphasis on longer-term recovery and resilience.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
