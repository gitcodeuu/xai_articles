By staying informed and taking proactive measures, citizens can minimize the risks associated with this weather event,” he mentioned.\nThe Chief Meteorologist’s prediction also highlighted the importance of preparedness and contingency planning. As the monsoon season was expected to continue, it was crucial for the relevant authorities and citizens alike to remain on high alert and take steps to mitigate the impact of severe weather events.\n“By working together, we can reduce the risks and ensure a safer, more resilient community,” he added.\nResponding to another query, Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfraz said, “The monsoon intensity is expected to gradually subside after September 10-12, marking the end of the rainy season.”\n“This transition will bring a welcome relief to the people, as the suffocating humidity and rainfall will give way to a more pleasant weather pattern,” he added.\n“As the monsoon withdraws, the region can expect a decrease in temperature and humidity, making the environment more comfortable for daily activities,” he said.\nChief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfraz also shared some reassuring news regarding the water reserves in the country’s dams that the water levels in two of the major dams are satisfactory, ensuring a sufficient supply of water to meet the needs of the population during the upcoming summer months.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
