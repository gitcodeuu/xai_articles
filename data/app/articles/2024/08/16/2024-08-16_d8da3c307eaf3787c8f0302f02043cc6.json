  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 16 (APP):The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and NADRA Technologies Limited (NTL) have successfully launched the biometric verification service for telecom companies and license applicants.\nAccording to the press release issued on Friday, the initiative is another step towards ease of doing business in Pakistan and this new facility will enable applicants to complete their identity verification process with ease and efficiency.\nAs of August 14, 2024, the nationwide network of NADRA e-Sahulat franchisees will be used for biometric verification of the officials of telecom service providers. This initiative follows a formal agreement between PTA and NTL, aimed at facilitating the identity verification process of telecom service providers applying for licenses.\nUnder this new mechanism, PTA will create a profile for each applicant, applying for a PTA license. Once the applicant receives their tracking ID, they will visit the nearest e-Sahulat outlet and present the tracking ID along with their original CNIC for biometric verification. The result will then be securely transmitted to PTA, ensuring a seamless and secure process.\nThis collaboration is expected to significantly expedite and simplify the licensing process for telecom services across the country, contributing to a more robust and efficient telecom infrastructure.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
