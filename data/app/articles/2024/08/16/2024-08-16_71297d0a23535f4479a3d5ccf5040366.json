Services available at the mobile center will include vehicle registration, transfer procedures, and payment of token taxes.\nThe facility will also handle the issuance of documents like domicile certificates, birth certificates, power of attorney, international driving permits, and fuel permits for both domestic and commercial needs.\nBy bringing these services to the local community, ICT is reducing the need for residents to travel to government offices, allowing them to manage their civic duties more efficiently.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
