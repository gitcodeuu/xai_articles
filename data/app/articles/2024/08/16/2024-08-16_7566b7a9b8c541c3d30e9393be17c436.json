  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 16 (APP):Following the Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed its appeal; M/s Options International deposited the PKR 6 million penalties under Section 40(8) of the Competition Act 2010 into national treasury.\nThis Supreme Court decision marks the end of a comprehensive legal battle that began with a formal complaint from STARBUCKS leading to an investigation and enforcement action by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).\nIn June 2024, the Competition Appellate Tribunal (CAT) dismissed Options International’s appeal, increasing the primary penalty from Rs5 million to PKR 6 million and prohibiting the company from illegally using the Starbucks brand name and logo.\nM/s Options International has filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the CAT’s order, which the court dismissed. The Supreme Court ruled that “Options International,” put itself forward by selling its products under the international brand name Starbucks and by using its logo, which amounts to deceptive marketing.\nSince the new management has taken over, CCP has effectively recovered fines of PKR 38 million, demonstrating substantial progress in its fight against cartel conduct.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
