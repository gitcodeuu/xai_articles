  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 16 (APP):The bilateral relations between Pakistan and the Russian Federation are forging ahead on an upward trajectory, with both nations actively exploring multifaceted cooperation opportunities in sectors such as trade, energy, and diplomacy,” said Sehar Kamran, Member of National Assembly, on Friday.\n“Whether in trade, energy, or diplomatic engagements, the relationship between Pakistan and Russia is strengthening across all dimensions. Both countries possess vast untapped potential for collaboration. Russia is a major energy exporter, and Pakistan can benefit from its oil and gas resources. Similarly, Pakistan can provide access to the Arabian Sea and the Middle East to Russian traders and suppliers,” she said, talking to APP.\nSehar Kamran, who has represented Pakistan at numerous international forums in Russia, including BRICS, SCO Women Congress, IPU Assembly, and others in recent years, noted that the past two decades have seen a significant enhancement in Pak-Russian diplomatic ties, driven by consistent high-level interactions.\nShe referred to a congratulatory letter from the Russian Ambassador in Islamabad, Albert Khorev, on Independence Day, which read: “The Russian Federation attaches great importance to its relations with Pakistan, and I am confident that their steadfast and consistent development serves the best interests of both our peoples. I appreciate your important and constructive role in our bilateral engagements.”\n“It underscores our strong friendship… It was truly heartening to see the colors of the Pakistani flag illuminated in Moscow. This reflects the deepening bilateral ties and the strong bond of friendship between our two nations,” she said in her reciprocal letter to the envoy.\nOn her X timeline, Sehar Kamran also responded to a congratulatory video message by the Russian ambassador on Pakistan’s 78th Independence Day, in which she reaffirmed her commitment to continuous efforts for stronger bilateral relations, emphasizing the potential for deeper collaboration in various fields.\nAmbassador Albert Khorev said in his message, “Russia and Pakistan have already been friends throughout the years, and I am sure that we will see our already robust and fruitful relations reach new heights and help both our countries thrive. Pakistan is home to incredibly talented, hardworking, and open-hearted people, and I’m confident that they are the nation’s greatest asset.”\nThe PPP parliamentarian, also the recipient of the Russian State Award in recognition of her efforts to promote bilateral relations, mentioned last year’s visit of former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to Russia and high-level interactions, which instilled new impetus into bilateral ties.\nCalling it a stepping stone in bilateral ties, she mentioned the shipment of Russian crude oil to Pakistan and said that Pakistan was also outlining a process to open barter trade with neighboring countries of Russia, Iran, and Afghanistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
