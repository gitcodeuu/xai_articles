  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 16 (APP): Secretary of the Women’s Parliamentary Caucus, Dr. Shahida Rehmani, strongly condemned the inappropriate and derogatory remarks made by PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi regarding a woman’s dress on Friday.\nIn her statement, Dr. Rehmani called on National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq to immediately suspend Iqbal Afridi’s membership and to file an FIR against him under the Workplace Harassment Act.\nExpressing her outrage, Dr. Rehmani said , “Both Islam and Pakistan’s Constitution grant women full freedom and equal rights. Iqbal Afridi’s disgraceful act reflects a regressive and criminal mindset that obstructs the pursuit of gender equality in Pakistan.”\nShe emphasized that such behavior must be condemned in the strongest terms. “Women should be judged based on their work, education, and competence, not their appearance or clothing. Such objections are a blatant violation of our societal values and constitutional rights, and they will not be tolerated under any circumstances.”\nDr. Rehmani also highlighted that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has always been at the forefront of protecting women’s rights and dignity.\n“We completely reject any actions or statements that aim to undermine the honor, dignity, and professional skills of women. Iqbal Afridi’s mentality and views mirror the ‘playboy’ mindset of his party leader, which is unacceptable in any civilized society”he added.\nThe Women’s Parliamentary Caucus stands firmly with the female officer, offering all possible legal and moral support. “We want to make it clear that the rights of women guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution will be protected at all costs, and strict legal action will be taken against such derogatory actions,” Dr. Rehmani concluded.",
