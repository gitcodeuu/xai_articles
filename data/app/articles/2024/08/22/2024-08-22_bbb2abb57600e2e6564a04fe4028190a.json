  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 22 (APP): The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) and the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination have jointly decided to support Pakistani students studying medicine and dentistry abroad.\nAfter a recent meeting, both bodies have come together to create a unified approach that will help these students make the most of their education while ensuring that Pakistan’s financial resources are effectively utilized.\nStarting from the 2025-26 academic year, the PM&DC and the Ministry will implement a new set of guidelines designed to streamline the process of integrating foreign-trained professionals into Pakistan’s healthcare system.\nThese changes aim to help students avoid enrolling in institutions with lower academic standards and to ensure a smooth transition upon their return to Pakistan.\nTo help guide students, the PM&DC will work closely with Pakistani diplomatic missions to make sure foreign universities meet the necessary criteria.\nFor the 2024-25 academic year, Pakistani students seeking admission to international medical and dental schools will need to meet specific requirements.\nThey must hold a valid Multiple Entry Visa for the duration of their studies and have completed F.Sc Pre-Medical with at least 60% marks, or achieved a minimum of 550 in each SAT-II subject, or 50% in foreign MCAT/UCAT exams in Biology, Chemistry, and either Mathematics or Physics.\nAdditionally, they need to score atleast 50% in the MDCAT conducted in Pakistan, with these results valid for three years.\nIt’s important that the foreign institution is recognized by the PM&DC, especially for enrollments before the 2024-25 academic year.\nThe medical qualification should be from a WFME-accredited institution, and students must secure a PM&DC Student Registration Certificate before starting their studies.\nThey will also need to complete at least 6,200 hours of study over five years, maintaining an 80% attendance rate.\nFor those studying in non-English-speaking countries, six months of language training is required.\nMoreover, passing the National Registration Examination (NRE) is essential for full PM&DC registration after qualification.\nStudents must also provide their residence and contact details in their host country before departure.\nThis policy is designed to help Pakistani students abroad achieve the highest standards in their education and ensure they are well-prepared to contribute positively to Pakistan’s healthcare system upon their return.",
