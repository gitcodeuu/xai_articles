The court remarked that it would suspend the order if the university didn’t find reasonable solution.\nThe university’s lawyer adopted the stance that there were vacations after the completion of semester due to which rooms were being evicted from students. He said that the decision is taken to stop the incidents of clashes between students’ groups.\nThe court said that the rooms should be allotted as per the merit, adding that the students have no right to choose the rooms themselves. It asked the university administration to re-allot the rooms to the students.\nThe lawyer requested the court to grant time to take instructions from administration. The further hearing was then adjourned till tomorrow.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
