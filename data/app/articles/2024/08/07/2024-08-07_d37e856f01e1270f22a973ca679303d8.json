The meeting decided that the Pakistani pilgrims would be issued visas by the Iraqi Embassy, bypassing travel agents and the quota for Pakistan pilgrims would be increased.\nIt was also decided that special flights would be operating from Pakistan for Pakistani pilgrims while a new consulate will be opened in Karachi and both sides initiate a crackdown on agents charging excessive fees from pilgrims. The meeting also decided Visa waiver agreement on diplomatic and official passports while it was requested for the visa fee waiver for the ordinary pilgrims.\nThe decisions aim to provide equal facilities to Pakistani pilgrims, ensuring a hassle-free experience.\nMohsin Naqvi thanked the Iraqi counterparts for their cooperation, while Ambassador Lafta extended an invitation to visit Iraq.\nIn a swift follow-up, Naqvi secured approval from Federal Aviation Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif to allow Iraqi airlines to operate special flights, with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) also set to announce its schedule soon.
