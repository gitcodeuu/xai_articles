  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 07 (APP): The Chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on Federal Education and Professional Training, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt on Wednesday directed the establishment of a grievance desk to assist students with document attestation and related queries.\nShe was chairing the Senate Standing Committee on Federal Education and Professional Training convened at the Old PiPs Hall, Parliament Lodges.\nThe meeting was attended by Senators Irfan-Ul-Haq Siddiqui, Falaz Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Ashraf Ali Jatoi, Syed Masroor Ahsan, Kamran Murtaza, and Khalida Ateeb. Senior representatives from relevant departments were also present.\nThe committee extensively reviewed several issues, including unregistered universities, the attestation of degrees for affected students, teacher reinstatement, and the affiliation policy introduced by the Higher Education Commission (HEC).\nThe committee also addressed the issue of unregistered universities. Representatives from the University of New Port Institute of Communication and Economics Karachi, South Asian University Lahore, and Preston Institute of Management Science and Technology Karachi, Lahore, and their affiliated branches presented their cases. The committee discussed mechanisms for degree attestation to prevent fraudulent degrees, as previously outlined in meetings with the HEC.\nFor attestation, a commission will draft a checklist for universities, including student fee details, which may include bank statements from the University, admission forms, transcripts, and other required documents and approval from the Board of Governors.\nUniversities must provide an affidavit guaranteeing the accuracy of the data. Once the data is verified, the checklist will be cross-checked with student records before attestation is granted.\nThe chairperson instructed the HEC and universities to collaborate on drafting the data form and student checklist, and to update the committee in the next meeting. Additionally, she directed the establishment of a grievance desk to assist students with document attestation and related queries, and sought a follow-up on this initiative.\nIn discussing the implementation of the notification dated October 27, 2023, regarding the reinstatement of 137 lecturers by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training, the committee provided an opportunity for all stakeholders to present their cases. Following a detailed review, it was determined that the October 27 notification for employee reinstatement was valid and should have been implemented fully. The chairperson emphasized the need for collaboration among institutions to avoid court delays. She noted that timely and collaborative action could prevent issues from escalating to the courts.\nThe ministry reported that of the 137 employees, the AGPR had released salaries for 87. The chairperson inquired about the non-release of salaries for the remaining employees and was informed that AGPR had not released these salaries due to court restrictions. The chairperson requested the presence of an AGPR representative, who was absent. Consequently, she directed that a letter be sent to AGPR requesting an explanation for their absence. The committee concluded by directing the ministry to provide updated information and to hold accountable those responsible for the eight-month delay in implementing the notification.\nAdditionally, the committee addressed administrative and operational concerns related to Punjab University and examined it’s revised policy for affiliating universities, which includes defining jurisdiction for granting affiliations, monitoring and evaluating affiliated colleges, and implementing HEC policies.\nThe university proposed amendments to the policy, but the chairperson emphasized that policy matters should remain free from any self-serving interests, ensuring that public educational entities operate transparently and effectively.",
