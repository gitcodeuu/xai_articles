  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 7 (APP):Dr. Musadik Malik, Federal Minister for Petroleum, emphasized the need for political sanity and tolerance to tackle Pakistan’s pressing issues. In an interview with a private news channel on Wednesday, he highlighted the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) economic policies, which he claimed reduced inflation from 38% last year to 12%.\nMalik criticized the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) regime, stating that it dragged the country into an economic crisis, which the current government has since recovered from. He accused the PTI’s former chairman of perpetuating chaos and lawlessness since losing power. Malik specifically cited the May 9 events, where he alleged that PTI supporters desecrated martyrs’ statues, as an example of this destructive behavior.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
