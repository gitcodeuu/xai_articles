There was also brain drain in the country, he added.\nDr Sattar said that the consumer tax ratio should not be beyond 2.5 percent.\n“There is more than 20 hours loadshedding in Karachi whereas it should not be more than 7.5 hours under the consumer management system amid high losses as per the power distribution laws,” he said.\nHe urged the Federal Government to give a special package to the middle class that would drive development and growth in the country. “A package should also be given to Karachi as it gives half of the Rs 8,000 billion’s total revenue being collected.”\nHe said the government should give special grants to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and domestic consumers for solar panel installation especially in  Karachi and Hyderabad.\n“Sales tax needs to be reduced on fuel and electricity, whereas tax on packaged milk should be limited to 5% instead of the proposed 18% as 40% of the nation’s child population is stunted,” he added.\nThe taxes on export sector and construction industry needed to be reviewd as the latter had 60 businesses associated to it, he said, adding, “The Construction sector gave Rs 50 billion tax last year and Rs 25 billion this year due to the 7E tax, which should be abolished along with tax on POS (point of sale) retailers,” he added.\n“Mark up rate of 22% needs to be reduced by the State Bank of Pakistan, whereas agriculture income tax needs to be introduced on bigger land owners to increase tax base instead of tax volume,” Dr Sattar said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
