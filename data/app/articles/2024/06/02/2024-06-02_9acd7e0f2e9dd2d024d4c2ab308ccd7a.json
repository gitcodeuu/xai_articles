The campaign will last seven days in Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad.\nHe said that in the other districts the campaign will run for five days. He further stated that over 40,000 polio workers will participate in the campaign, with more than 14,000 polio workers active in Lahore alone.\nHe said that the extensive participation underscores the commitment to eradicating polio from the region. He highlighted the urgency of the campaign by noting that the polio virus has been detected in environmental samples in Punjab.\nThe summer season poses a significant risk as it creates favourable conditions for the spread of the virus, he said adding that increased traffic during the summer and Eid holidays further heightens the risk of transmission.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
