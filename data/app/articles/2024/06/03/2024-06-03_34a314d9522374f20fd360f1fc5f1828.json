  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 3 (APP):As temperatures have soared to the unprecedented levels in the federal capital, like other parts of the country, the parents are contemplating on sending their kids to the summer camps to engage them in healthy activities or keep them indoors to stay safe from the impacts of scorching heat.\nWith start of summer vacation in most of the educational institutions of federal capital, different institutions have started offering innovative summer camps for keeping the students intact with the learning activities.\nDifferent schools have disseminated the information about the summer camp through social media to attract the parents with a variety of fun-filled activities and skills like gymnastics, swimming, creative writing, phonics and comprehension, confidence building exercises, music, sports, puppet play, baking and cooking and water games etc.\nThese schools are charging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 and more for offering summer camps of 10 to 30 days.\nSome parents consider the summer camps as a futile exercise and wastage of time and money however the others consider such activities highly useful for skill development and confidence building in the children.\n“Summer camps are just another tactic for the private schools to extract money from the pockets of the parents through charging hefty amounts by engaging them in ordinary activities contrary what they advertise”, Nosheen Fatima, a mother of two school going children said.\nTalking to APP, she said that “These summer schools are meant for a specific class which can afford spending too much money on such activities. Summer vacations are meant to keep the children indoors to save them from the intense summer heat at the peak time”.\nKamran Ali, another parent said, “For me, summer camps are highly beneficial for the kids in terms of boosting their confidence out of classroom environment. Some schools are offering excellent activities which are good to engage the students in healthy activities instead of giving them electronic gadgets.”\n“The kids usually finish their summer vacation work during the week or two and then they find nothing constructive to do at homes as the parents remain busy in the office and house chores. So, it is better to send our children to such camps to gain exposure and knowledge”, he said.\nDifferent studies have proved that the summer camps play good role in nurturing the self-confidence in the children, independence, environmental awareness and learning about different situations.\nAreeba Khalid, a parent of an eight-year child said, “My son is studying in Grade-II in one of the top-notch schools of the capital. After paying bimonthly school fee of Rs. 42,000, the school administration is asking for submitting Rs 12,000 for 15-day summer camp which is not affordable for me in prevailing price hike situation.\nBesides, it is not advisable by the experts to send kids to the schools during the hot weather conditions, she said. Another parent Amina Farrukh said, “I have selected one of the best institutions in the F-10 sector for my five-year daughter to attend their summer camp offering wide range of activities”.\nShe said summer vacations are the best time to inculcate skills among our children like swimming, creative writing, acting, music and others which ultimately determine their interest in specific fields which they pursue in future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
