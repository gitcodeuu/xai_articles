Climate change and global warming know no borders. I will ask young women journalists to work on climate change,” Romina Khurshid Alam said.\nShe added that women had done a great job in the field of journalism, and they should strive to project a positive image of the country, whereas such workshops, especially on climate change, should be conducted more frequently.\nRomina Khurshid said a small piece of news could destroy or make a life, adding, “So the duty should be rendered responsibly.”",
