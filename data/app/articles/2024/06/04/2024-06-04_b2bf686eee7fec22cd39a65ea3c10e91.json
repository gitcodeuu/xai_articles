The number and duration of droughts has increased by 29 per cent since 2000 – without urgent action, droughts may affect over three-quarters of the world’s population by 2050,” the United Nations official website wrote.\nThe Day was first celebrated in 1972 during the United Nations Human Environment Conference, held in Stockholm, Sweden on June 5.\nThe moot spearheaded important discussions on environmental protection and therefore, the first World Environment Day was celebrated in 1973 that continued the tradition for decades so far.\nThe WED helps in creating education, awareness, and spearheads action among the communities to upscale environmental sustainability through campaigns, events, and initiatives for addressing environmental challenges for a liveable future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
