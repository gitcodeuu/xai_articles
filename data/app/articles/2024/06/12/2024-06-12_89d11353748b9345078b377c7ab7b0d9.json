Additionally, taxes on large and luxury vehicles are being increased to balance the fiscal needs.\nHe highlighted the importance of fulfilling promises made to the public and steering the country’s affairs in the right direction by working as a team. He urged everyone to participate in the budget debate and put forward suggestions for the public welfare.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
