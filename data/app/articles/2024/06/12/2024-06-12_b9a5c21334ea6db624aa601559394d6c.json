He urged the government to establish a scientific mechanism for debt management.\nHe also recommended that the government should privatize loss-making organizations, emphasizing that business operations should fall under private entities’ jurisdiction rather than the government.\nFarooq suggested that the government should further enhance Karachi’s infrastructure, highlighting its importance as a business hub. He noted that investing Rs100 billion in the metropolitan city could boost the country’s annual growth rate by one percent.\nHe also called for a reduction in electricity, oil, and gas prices to improve the purchasing power of the common people. Additionally, he proposed providing small loans to help them become economically self-sufficient.\nFurthermore, Farooq advocated for the launch of the Benazir Income Generation Programme, stating it would financially empower the poor.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
