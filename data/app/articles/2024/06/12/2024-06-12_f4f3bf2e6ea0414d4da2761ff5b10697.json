  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP):The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training has eliminated the requirement of Form B for getting admission in federal government schools.\n“It has come to our attention that the previous requirement of producing Form B as a condition for admission in federal government schools has inadvertently restricted access to education for underprivileged children,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.\n“This practice has disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, including undocumented children,” it added.\n“In light of this, we have decided to correct this policy and remove the requirement of Form B as a prerequisite for admission. Effective immediately, all children living in Islamabad, regardless of their documentation status, will be eligible for enrollment in government schools,” the ministry said.\nAccording to the Ministry, “our goal is to ensure that every child has access to quality education, regardless of their background or circumstances. We believe that every child deserves an opportunity to shape their destiny, and we are committed to providing a supportive and inclusive learning environment.”.\n“This policy correction is a step towards creating a more equitable and just society where every child can thrive and reach their full potential,” the ministry further added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
