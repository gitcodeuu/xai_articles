He said that the event would be attended by prominent artists who shed light on Rahi’s life and career.\nMansoor Rahi was the leading abstractionist painter of Pakistan and his teaching and influence have led to the emergence of a larger number of prominent artists than any other teacher artist.\nIn earlier years of his career, Mansoor Rahi caught his eye for cubism paintings and adopted the discipline in his paintings.\nHowever, Mansoor Rahi’s painting style changed in various stages of his life. From 1969, his style changed, though it was evolving in the same direction.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
