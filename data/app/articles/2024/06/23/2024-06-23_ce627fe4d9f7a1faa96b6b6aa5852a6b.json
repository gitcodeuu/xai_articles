The number of male visitors was 762,101, while the number of female visitors stood at 641,539.\nThe authority noted that there are four stages in managing the influx of visitors to Al-Rawdah Al-Sharifa: verifying appointment bookings through the Nusuk and Tawakkalna applications, scanning the QR code through e-devices, directing visitors to waiting areas inside the Prophet’s Mosque, and then facilitating their entry into Al-Rawdah Al-Sharifa as per Saudi Press Agency (SPA).\nThe authority, in cooperation with security and service agencies at the mosque, has worked to ease the process for visitors and worshippers to pray at Al-Rawdah Al-Sharifa and visit the tombs of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his two companions. These efforts align with the leadership’s aspirations to serve the visitors and worshippers at the Prophet’s Mosque.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
