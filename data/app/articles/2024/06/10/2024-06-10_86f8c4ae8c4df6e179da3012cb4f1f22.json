However, Pakistan due to lying in the Himalyan foothills is most affected by climate change.”\nThe 2022 unexpected floods left 4.4 million acre crops damaged, one million livestock perished and millions of people affected by heatwaves, he said, adding, “ In order to redress the damages, Kisan package 2022, seeds and agricultural medicines on subsidized rates, climate resilient seeds, establishment of seed developing authority, water storage and drip irrigation mechanisms have been introduced.”\nHe informed that the National Adaptation Plan prepared that required the country $152 billion to implement the proposed plans by 2030.\n“Living Indus Initiative project has been started, and Recharge Pakistan project prepared to conserve rain and flood water is being initiated at a cost of $57 million whereas its first part is completed,” Tarar said.\nClimate Impact Agriculture research and planning project of $35 million was underway, whereas all these initiatives were started from the limited resources of the government, he added.\nSenator Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur while moving the motion said Pakistan has world’s second highest glaciers that were above 3000 and melting faster.\n“According to Economic Survey 2022-23, 34% of the arable land has been converted into non-agricultural land for development activities like housing societies.

We can benefit from global climate finance with increased share for Pakistan to build dams,” he added.\nHe said food security was an issue that would aggravate in the coming years as it was witnessed during wheat season and therefore, food security should be on the government’s top priority.\nThe Deputy Chairman Senate on completion of the debate disposed off the agenda.",
