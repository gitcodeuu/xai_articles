There is no destruction in the country, but rather investment is coming and nations are coming to Pakistan for investment,” he added.\nThe Opposition was here for the strengthening of this system and the treasury benches honoured them and it will be achieved with their cooperation, he said, adding, “They should not promote hopelessness in the country.”\nThe Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz requested the Chairman Senate to issue production orders for Senator Ejaz Chaudhry.\nLater, the quorum was pointed out which was not complete, and the session was adjourned to meet again on Tuesday July 11th, 2024 till 5pm.\nAPP/ajb-raz",
