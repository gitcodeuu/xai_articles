  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):A recent study by the Research & Innovation Centre at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) has shown the effectiveness of preventive measures taken to protect pilgrims from health risks associated with high temperatures during Hajj, according to SPA.\nDespite an average temperature increase of 0.4 degrees Celsius per decade in Makkah, the study found a 74.6% decrease in the number of heat stroke cases, and a 47.6% decrease in mortality rates. These positive outcomes can be attributed to the implementation of preventive measures, which create a safe and healthy environment for pilgrims.\nThe study, published in the Journal of Travel Medicine, examines four decades of meteorological data and records of heat-related illnesses during the Hajj season in Makkah, highlighting the relationship between rising temperature and the associated health risks.\nAccording to the study, Saudi Arabia has implemented several measures at individual, structural, and community levels to mitigate heat-related health risks for pilgrims during Hajj. These measures include using water mist sprays to cool the air in open spaces and reduce heat for the crowds, providing water and umbrellas to pilgrims, and ensuring the availability of air-conditioned transport, including metro lines operational since 2010, which offer comfortable transportation for pilgrims.\nMoreover, the Kingdom has focused on increasing awareness among pilgrims and healthcare providers about heat-related illnesses, ensuring access to free healthcare services during Hajj, and improving the surveillance and management of cases.\nThis includes implementing heat-related disease management guidelines set by the Ministry of Health, which outline specific procedures before and after hospital admission.\nThe release added that these measures enable quick identification and treatment of heat-related cases during Hajj for a better outcome. Additionally, environmental engineering strategies and building design have been integrated to enhance natural ventilation, decrease heat retention at the holy sites, increase shading areas, and reduce overcrowding.\nThe results of the study extend beyond the local context and can be generalized to the global population.  The Hajj serves as “a unique microcosm” for studying heat-related risks, as it is attended by millions of pilgrims from over 180 countries who perform rituals in a high-temperature desert environment. This aspect holds “immense scientific value” for planning and improving responses to rising global temperatures, according to the release.\nKFSH&RC has been ranked first in the Middle East and Africa and 20th globally, in the list of the world’s top 250 Academic Medical Centers for the second consecutive year, and recognized as the most valuable healthcare brand in the Kingdom and the Middle East, according to the 2024 Brand Finance rankings. Additionally in the same year, it was ranked among the world’s best 250 hospitals by Newsweek magazine,” the release said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
