He pointed-out that commercialisation of agricultural land without planning was also a threat to the environment.\nZeeshan Rafique said that it was necessary to regularise residential projects without approval. “A new law will be made to monitor the master plan of commercial projects. Under the proposed law, all matters will be monitored from a single platform,” he said. The real estate representatives agreed to the committee’s agenda and assured their cooperation, however they requested that there should be further consultation before taking a final decision, the minister added.\nZeeshan Rafique said that the employment of many people was directly or indirectly attached to the real estate business. “So it is equally important to safeguard investors’ capital”, he added. He further said that non-regularisation of illegal schemes harmed public interest and invited uncertainty. “Actions in this regard will be ensured and suggestions from the real estate sector will also be taken into consideration”, he pledged.\nAgriculture Minister Syed Ashiq Hussain Kirmani said that multiple government agencies’ involvement created complications for both buyers and sellers. He said that the aim of the Punjab government was to ensure the protection of the interests of the people under single authority.\nKirmani said that the practice of building high-rise buildings on a small area should be promoted so that the need of a large population could be met in a minimum use of land. He also said that it was important to take early steps for food security. “That is why the chief minister formed this committee”, he added.\nMeanwhile, the minister visited Islampura area of ??Lahore. He inspected ongoing development schemes at Union Council 73, Dataganj Bakhsh Town.
