  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP):Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC)/ Education Testing Council (ETC) has introduced the Undergraduate Studies Admissions Test (USAT) as a standardized tool for assessing student admissions to universities.\nAccording to HEC, USAT is designed to ensure quality in the admissions process by evaluating academic aptitude.\nIt has been noticed that there is misinformation circulating regarding the USAT. It is clarified that while HEC recommends USAT to universities, it is not mandatory for institutions to accept USAT scores. Each university retains the autonomy to decide whether to adopt USAT or conduct its own admission tests.\nHEC encourages universities to consider USAT as a valuable option for admissions assessment. However, the decision to use USAT rests solely with each university. All stakeholders are urged to understand this clarification to avoid any misunderstandings about the application of USAT in university admissions across Pakistan.\nFor further information and updates, please visit the HEC website or contact HEC ETC office directly.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
