  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 6 (APP): The International Labour Organisation (ILO), in collaboration with the US Department of Labour (USDOL), held a comprehensive training workshop to enhance the capacity of journalists.\nThe workshop was held at the ILO office here under the auspices of the BRIDGE project, an initiative focused on eliminating forced labour and promoting fair labour practices.\nThe two-day workshop brought together a diverse group of 25 journalists representing print, electronic, radio, and digital media platforms. National project coordinator at ILO, Dr Faisal Iqbal and renowned journalist Aoun Sahi jointly led the training workshop.\nDr Faisal Iqbal emphasised the significance of media in addressing the pressing issues of forced labour and fair recruitment. He explained the 11 indicators recognised by the ILO globally to identify forced labour, including abuse of authority, deception, movement, isolation, physical and sexual violence, intimidation and threats, and retention of identity thefts.\n“Globally, 28 million people were trapped in forced labour,” said Dr Iqbal. “Forced labour is a criminal offence and a serious violation of fundamental human rights.”\nHe also highlighted the importance of social protection measures by the government to combat forced labour effectively.\nAoun Sahi provided journalists with extensive training on forced labour, labour migration, on the role of media, story identification and pitching, finding relevant data and information, gender-sensitive and rights-based approaches and effective storytelling techniques for different media platforms.\nHe also discussed the importance of humanizing the story of forced labour and fair recruitment and interviewing survivors in light of ethical considerations. “Reporting on these subjects must be conducted with clarity and thorough research, and voices from all players must be included in the story,” Sahi stressed.\nAoun Sahi also shared insights from an ILO report “Profits and poverty: The economics of forced labour” issued in March 2024, revealing that the annual costs and profits of forced labour globally amount to a staggering $236 billion. He further highlighted that 3.5 out of every thousand individuals worldwide are involved in forced labour, with industries, services, and agriculture being the top three sectors affected, according to the report.\nEarlier, the ILO Country Director, Geir T. Tonstol in his opening remarks emphasised the crucial role of media in raising public awareness about forced labour and promoting fair recruitment practices. “Media can be key influencers in shaping public perceptions about forced labour and labour migration,” he said.\nHe expressed concern over the prevalence of forced labour and bonded labour in Pakistan, with an estimated 3.4 million individuals subjected to such conditions. Tonstol also briefed the journalists on the four goals of ILO in Pakistan, which include employment for youth, social protection, international labour standards, and occupational safety and health.\nThe workshop concluded with participants showing keen interest and actively engaging in discussions, group work, and practical exercises throughout the two days.",
