  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 6 (APP):A recent study conducted in the United States reveals a significant increase in stroke incidence among young and middle-aged individuals globally over the past decade.\nAccording to research published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the primary causes of stroke include obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and physical inactivity.\nThese factors, combined with lifestyle choices, have contributed to the rising stroke rates among younger populations, report said.\nSymptoms of a stroke can vary but often include sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body.\nOther symptoms include confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, vision problems in one or both eyes, difficulty walking, loss of balance and severe headache with no known cause.\nAmerican experts reviewed data from thousands of individuals across various states to analyze stroke rates and demographics.\nFindings of study indicated that the risk of stroke among younger individuals has increased by 15 percent in the last 10 years.\nIndividuals as young as 18 years old have been reported to suffer from strokes, a notable shift compared to past trends where strokes were more common in older adults.\nExperts attribute this change to various lifestyle and health factors, including poor diet, lack of physical activity, and increased stress levels.\nExperts recommend that individuals, particularly younger adults, adopt healthier lifestyles to mitigate stroke risk.\nRegular physical activity, a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, routine health check-ups, and stress management are crucial preventive measures.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
