  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 11 (APP):The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) Tuesday hosted the launch ceremony of Salman Faruqui’s book, “Dear Mr Jinnah: 70 Years In The Life Of A Pakistani Civil Servant.”\nThe memoir “Dear Mr. Jinnah” blends Faruqui’s personal reminiscences with first-hand accounts of developments in Pakistan in different domains from 1947 to 2017, said a press release issued here.\nDuring his long and distinguished career,  Salman Faruqui served in top civil service positions, including as Federal Secretary, Ambassador At Large, Secretary General to the President, Deputy Chairman Planning Commission, and Federal Ombudsman.\nThe discussants and reviewers for the book launch included: Senator Mushahid Hussain; Ameena Saiyid, Managing Director Lightstone Publishers; eminent civil servants Shakil Durrani and Ejaz Rahim; former Senator Farhatullah Babar; and prominent journalist Nasim Zehra.\nIn his welcome remarks, DG ISSI Ambassador Sohail Mahmood highlighted Salman Faruqui’s illustrious career and his valuable contributions. In his view, three aspects stood out about Salman Faruqui: his immense professional competence, humility, and wisdom.\nThese attributes were remarkable features for a person whose career had seen tremendous heights and who had spent much time in close proximity to absolute power. In his reckoning, there were many lessons for others in Faruqui’s life and career.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood added that  Faruqui’s letter to the father of the nation (contained in the book) is extraordinary in many respects, as it underscores his unshakable belief in the Quaid’s vision of a democratic and progressive Pakistan.\nHe pointed out that the book is neither a history of Pakistan nor a book of revelations about power politics by an insider. Rather, as aptly described by the author himself, it is a “memoir of governance conducted at the edge of a precipice” and the account is rendered, in author’s own reckoning, with “clinical objectivity.”\nHe stressed that the author is not a prophet of doom, but a messenger of hope.\nHe expressed the hope that most people, particularly the youth, would benefit from the experience and wisdom encapsulated in the book.\nAmeena Saiyid described “Dear Mr. Jinnah” as an outstanding and gripping memoir that showcases the author’s triumphs, struggles, and successes, as well as fascinating anecdotes. Saiyid advised that the book is particularly relevant for two groups: students and Pakistanis who struggle to make ends meet. She concluded by proposing that the duty on paper be reduced or waived, making books more accessible and readable for a wider audience.\nSenator Mushahid Hussain commenced his remarks by crediting Ameena Saiyid for promoting a strong culture of writing and reading, of which Salman Faruqui’s book represents an esteemed example.\nSenator Mushahid Hussain termed  Faruqui as a “doer, who delivers,”; someone who served with great distinction throughout his long career in public service. He appreciated  Faruqui’s initiatives, including his work for differently abled people, the actualization of the Gwadar Port with the Singapore Port Authority and China, and his crafting of important social and economic policies supporting Pakistan’s modernization drive. He concluded by appreciating Mr. Faruqui’s book as a memoir of legacy, dedication, commitment, and hard work.\nShakil Durrani introduced Salman Faruqui as an 8-year-old boy at the time of the partition who took the train from Patiala to Lahore, setting the stage for his remarkable journey.\nHe credited  Faruqui with several initiatives, including the telecommunications revolution in Pakistan and the Benazir Income Support Programme.\nDurrani advised  Faruqui to elaborate further on his analysis of significant developments in Pakistan that he personally witnessed such as the March-April 2019 events when Pakistan turned the tide in the fight against terrorism, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of his experiences.\nSenator Farhatullah Babar highlighted the salient points of the book and praised  Faruqui’s most notable contribution to the state and society during his tenure as Federal Ombudsman.\nHe also shared his personal experiences with various political leaders, including Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto and President Asif Ali Zardari, and provided his insights on several pivotal events in Pakistan’s history.\nSenator Babar advised that despite the challenges faced by Pakistan, one should remain hopeful and determined about the country’s future.\nEjaz Rahim highlighted the central theme of the book as an “exploration” of the various forms of power, including administrative, political, social, institutional, and individual power.\nHe emphasized that with power comes the responsibility to ensure justice and enhance human dignity.\nHe described the book as a “melody” that reflects  Faruqui’s lifelong struggle.\nNasim Zehra praised the book “Dear Mr. Jinnah” as a highly readable and timely contribution that serves as a reminder for Pakistan to break free from the vicious cycle of past mistakes.\nIn her view, the book is a journey that takes readers from Pakistan’s humble beginnings to its current status, providing valuable insights into the country’s development over the past many decades.\nThe launch event was attended by a large number of people from different walks of life including civil services, academia, civil society, and the media.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
