This project ensures that children working in workshops, hotels, and factories receive quality education from 7 to 10 am.\nThe secretary emphasized the need to discourage child labor in brick kilns, workshops, hotels, and forced begging. Due to the effective measures taken by the dept there has been a significant reduction in the number of out-of-school children, and special initiatives have been taken to educate working children and members of the transgender community.\nIn his message, he further stressed the need for collective efforts and raising public awareness to eliminate child labor from society.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
