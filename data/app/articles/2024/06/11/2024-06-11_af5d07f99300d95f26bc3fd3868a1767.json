  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 11 (APP): The Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) has issued a press release informing of its important projects and investments in Makkah, Madinah, and other holy sites for the 1445 AH Hajj season, which aim to improve the electricity network and provide a stable and reliable power supply for pilgrims and residents, boost the quality of service and ensure the comfort of pilgrims during Hajj.\nOne of the main projects  is automating the distribution networks at the holy sites by linking smart stations to the fiber-optic network.\nThis project costs SAR200 million and involves extensive groundwork and concrete closures, covering distances of 335 km and 312 km, respectively.\nOver 2,400 stations have been connected to the fiber-optic network, boosting the efficiency and sustainability of the electrical network in densely populated areas, and reducing emergency response times to fractions of a second. This ensures a seamless experience for pilgrims, stakeholders, and all other beneficiaries.\nAnother important project involves expanding the electrical networks, improving existing stations, and integrating mobile stations into the current network. Furthermore, a gantry station was launched on May 1, 2024, at a cost of over SAR2 million.\nIt connects the aerial transport network with the ground network and aims to connect the 380 kV mobile station to the network. The goal is to enhance the stability of the electrical network and ensure efficient energy delivery to key areas at the holy sites.\nSEC has also connected 110 kV mobile stations with an investment of SAR60 million.\nOperational since May 31, 2024, this project covers a network exceeding 4 km, with a total station capacity of 147 MVA, improving power distribution and meeting the increased demand during Hajj, thus preventing outages that could affect the comfort and safety of pilgrims.\nAccording to the release, further investments include projects, worth over SAR166 million, for subscriber connections in the central area of Makkah and the holy sites.\nProjects to enhance medium- and low-voltage networks cost more than SAR36 million, while network replacement and the automation of distribution stations in these areas cost SAR46 million.\nAdditionally, a project to connect subscribers in pilgrim housing areas, costing over SAR6 million, has been implemented, along with several specialized distribution projects to improve electricity distribution, ensuring a stable and reliable service for pilgrims.\nRegarding facility development at the holy sites, SEC has set up 22 launch centers in Arafat, at a total cost of over SAR25 million. Six launch centers in Mina and Muzdalifah have also been established, costing more than SAR9 million. These centers ensure prompt and efficient response from technical teams to address any issues that may arise. Additionally, a building adjacent to the operations and control center, costing over SAR18 million, and eight buildings for stationed staff accommodation at transformer stations, costing more than SAR8 million, have been constructed.\nIn Madinah, projects include enhancing medium-voltage networks in the central area for SAR14 million; they extend over 22 km and include three stations. Low-voltage network improvements, costing SAR21 million, have added 35 km of new networks with a total capacity of 56 MVA across 20 stations. These projects will strengthen the electrical infrastructure and provide reliable service for residents and visitors in Madinah.\n“These initiatives are part of SEC’s ongoing national efforts to develop and improve electrical infrastructure at the holy sites, which experience high density during the Hajj season. The goal is to provide sustainable and efficient electrical services to ensure the comfort and safety of pilgrims and visitors while enriching their overall experience,” the release read.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
