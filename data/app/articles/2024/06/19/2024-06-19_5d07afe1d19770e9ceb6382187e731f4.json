Helpline numbers for calls, WhatsApp messages, and SMS were launched for citizen convenience, receiving and swiftly resolving approximately 150 complaints over three days.\nThis cleanliness operation consisted of three phases: first, sanitary workers collected waste door-to-door and consolidated it at central points; second, mechanized collection was conducted using mini-tipper vehicles; and third, waste from large piles was disposed of using dump trucks and front-end loaders at designated sites.\nIn this regard, 1,750 tons of waste was collected and disposed of on the first day of Eid, 757.67 tons on the second day and 109.85 tons on the third day.
