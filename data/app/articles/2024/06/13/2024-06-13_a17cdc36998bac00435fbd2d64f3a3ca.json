It will bring more transparency and efficiency to our tax system,” said Ahmed Khan, a local businessman.\nKey measures in the budget include a significant increase in employee salaries and a 27% boost in the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).\nThese steps are expected to provide immediate relief to the general public.\n“The increase in Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) funds will greatly help families in need. It is a commendable move by the government,” remarked Ayesha Ali, a school teacher.\nThe budget also focuses on the IT sector, introducing reforms and schemes aimed at increasing exports and creating new opportunities for the youth.\n“These reforms will not only boost our IT exports but also open up new avenues for young professionals,” said Salman Raza, an IT specialist. “It is encouraging to see the government investing in the future of our youth.”",
