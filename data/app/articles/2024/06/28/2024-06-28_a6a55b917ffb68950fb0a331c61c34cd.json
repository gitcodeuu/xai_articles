Vawda answered in the affirmation.\nThe chief justice said that under Article 66 of the Constitution “you can speak in the Parliament. However, the court is accepting your unconditional apology”.\nHe asked the two persons to be careful in this matter in the future.\nThe court, in its order regarding the today’s hearing, stated that it withdrew the show-cause notices served to Faisal Vawda and Mustafa Kamal, and hoped that the two accused would remain stand with their submitted answer.\n“If something like this happens again, a mere apology will not be acceptable,” it warned.\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court also issued show cause notices to news channels for live running anti-judiciary talks of the two accused.\nThe order said that the reply to the show cause notice should be submitted with the joint signatures of the channel owners and the chief executives. The details of the earnings from the press conference should also be given in response to the show cause notice, it added.\nThe CJP instructed lawyer Faisal Siddiqui to submit the answer within 2 weeks.\nThe case was then adjourned for an indefinite time.",
