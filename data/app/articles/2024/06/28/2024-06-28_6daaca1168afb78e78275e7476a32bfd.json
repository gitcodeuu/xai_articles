When the gates of Parliament House were closed for us, we used to sit with you and convey our voice to the people.”\nHe said efforts were being made to solve the problems of journalists on priority. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was working to address the issues of journalist community.\nThe minister paid tribute to the Parliamentary Reporters’ Association (PRA) for upholding freedom of press.\n“I have taken strict notice of the coordination problems arising in relation to the budget books, which will be solved immediately.”\nTarar confirmed that the matter would be resolved immediately by contacting the National Assembly Secretariat.\n“The doors of the Ministry of Information are open for the journalists round the clock. I stand with the journalists on the front line,” he added.\nHe said meetings would be held with the provincial governments to investigate the cases of murder of journalists.\n“A mechanism will be made in this regard in consultation with the provincial information ministers. A committee will be formed regarding the protection of the rights of journalists,” the minister affirmed.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said, had always focused on solving problems like delay in payment of salaries to media workers and journalists. “The issues of non-payment or delay of salaries are being discussed with the PBA (Pakistan Broadcasters Association) and APNS (All Pakistan Newspapers Society).”\nHe mentioned that the government’s focus was on payment of dues to the journalists and media workers, and that their rights would not be allowed to be exploited.\nHe said that still there was a lot of work to be done on the defamation law and talks were underway with journalist organizations in that regard.\n“I as the Federal Information Minister will sit and talk with the journalists regarding digital rights protection. The journalists organizations should play their due role regarding the defamation law,” Tarar said.\nThe minister underlined that there were proper laws in the country, and if someone was accused, he or she should prove their innocence in the court of law.",
