Monitoring of revenue authorities should be tightened, he said.\nHe said instead of seminars and ceremonies, focus should be held on constructive work.\nHe said that violence against women and girls was a very shameful act. However, implementation of the law “is a serious matter and we have to make women a part of the race of national development by our side”.\nThe minister said that laws should be made after deep considerations and the time had come to take urgent steps to solve the problems.\nHe said that the women should get equal rights in every field.",
