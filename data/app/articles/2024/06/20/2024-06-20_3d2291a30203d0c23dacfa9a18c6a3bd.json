These extreme weather events along with slow-onset impacts from climate change pose a growing risk for the sustainable development of all countries, but particularly for the most vulnerable countries and communities,” the PM’s aide highlighted.\n“But, despite climate action and investments in adaptation to climate change, residual risks leading to climate-related losses and damages still persist, resulting in more devastating impacts,” PM’s aide Romina Khurshid Alam pointed out.\n“When a climate-related disaster strikes, better systems need to be in place, providing immediate finance in the most efficient, effective and fast way for the most vulnerable,” She emphasized.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
