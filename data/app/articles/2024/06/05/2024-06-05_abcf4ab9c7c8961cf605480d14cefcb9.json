At the newly equipped centres, trainees will gain hands-on technical skills in industrial manufacturing and production processes of Personal Protective Equipment, apparel/textiles, plastic goods, light furniture, and other commercial goods production.\nAdditionally, MSMEs are also being offered access to the available facilities at the centres to assist in their commercial production work. Moreover, through the project’s commercial production and income generation model, the centres would be able to sustain themselves in the long run.\nDeputy Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan Van Nguyen highlighted the project’s interventions would enhance business development opportunities for enterprises and the vulnerable youth of Pakistan, enabling them to become more resilient and economically empowered.\nShe said, “With the right technologies and technical support provided by this project, Pakistan can leverage its labour-intensive MSMEs to produce export-quality products that are in high demand, both locally and internationally. This approach not only ensures increased productivity but also creates employment opportunities and improves prospects of income generation for Pakistan’s youth.”\nMinister Counsellor for Economic Commercial Affairs from the Government of China  Yang Guangyuan  said, “This project is truly small and smart. By teaching a person to fish, instead of giving him a fish, we could possibly help to feed him for a lifetime. I am delighted to know, that in the next 3 years, more than 10,000 young Pakistanis will get involved, with 50% of them being women, which will lay a solid foundation for relevant manufacturing industries in Pakistan. The future of Pakistan relies on young people. The future of Pakistan’s economy relies on export-oriented industry. The project combines these ‘two futures’. We are sincerely honoured, together with our close partner UNDP, to play a role in it.”\nChairman of Prime Ministers Youth Programme, Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan highlighted the importance of collaborative efforts in achieving sustainable development.\nHe said, “We believe that the holistic development of youth should be achieved through collaborative and cross-sectional approaches. Projects like this demonstrate that together, we can achieve great things. We also appreciate the support of our friends from China and UNDP in helping us build a brighter future for our youth, and look forward to continued collaboration and support in our efforts to empower the youth of Pakistan.”\nThis project was initiated under UNDP’s Stabilization and Inclusive Development Programme (SIDP), which aims to contribute to the economic development of vulnerable groups, particularly youth, women, and people with disabilities, through skills development, access to meaningful employment and by catalyzing the MSME sector.\nThe programme focuses on strengthening business-enabling environments by providing technical support to public institutions and the private sector for job-rich economic development. Additionally, SIDP equips vulnerable groups with the necessary skills to remove barriers to education and promote socially cohesive and resilient societies.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
