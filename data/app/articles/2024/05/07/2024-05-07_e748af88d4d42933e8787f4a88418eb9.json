Dr. Ghulam Sadiq Afridi, Member SSD at PARC, emphasized the importance of collaborative endeavors in his welcoming remarks during the inaugural session. Mr. Faiz Rasool, Head of Policy and Advocacy at GAIN, Pakistan, provided valuable insights into the current food security situation and significance of policy implication and the adaptation of innovative data tools through stakeholder engagement in driving positive change within food systems.\nThe workshop focused on key objectives, including the review of existing indicators and measures related to UNFSS pathways and national nutrition goals in Pakistan, identification of new indicators in underrepresented areas of the food system, and prioritization of new indicators to be developed as part of the Nourishing Food Pathways (NFP) program by GAIN.\nTechnical sessions, facilitated by Dr. Elizabeth Graham, Research Advisor – Nourishing Food Pathways Programme at GAIN, and other experts, enabled participants to engage in fruitful discussions, review existing indicators, and identify priority areas for new indicator development.\nThe outcomes of the workshop includes a comprehensive list of new indicators required for measuring food system transformation in Pakistan, particularly in underrepresented themes. Country-led prioritization of missing indicators, reflecting the priorities of stakeholders across Pakistan working on food system issues. Increased awareness and utilization of established data sources supported by PARC & GAIN in Pakistan, including the Pakistan Food System Dashboard (PFSD) and the supporting Food System Countdown Initiative. PARC-GAIN commitment to developing, piloting, and validating indicators as part of the Nourishing Food Pathways activities in Pakistan by 2027, intended for use in databases such as the PFSD and other relevant surveys.\nThe workshop’s findings would significantly contribute to Pakistan’s National Food System Dashboard, enhancing the country’s capacity to measure and monitor food system transformation accurately.",
