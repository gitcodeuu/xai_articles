Additionally, a complimentary Hajj SIM card with data and minutes ensures connectivity throughout the journey.\nThe mandatory Hujjaj App, designed to educate, track and assist pilgrims in performing Hajj obligations, reflects the ministry’s commitment to facilitating a seamless pilgrimage experience.\nAddressing the Hajj supporting staff, including Mouvaineen, doctors, paramedics and seasonal staff, Nadeem Khan motivated them to deliver their best in extending maximum facilities to the guests of Allah Almighty arriving at the holy places of Makkah al-Mukarramah and Madinah Al-Munawarah in KSA.\nHe emphasized that their performance would be minutely evaluated, and no negligence would be tolerated.\nIn response to a question, Nadeem Khan said the ministry was gradually switching over its Hajj operation to end-to-end automation, and the launch of the Hajj app was one of its main features.\n“We have completed 70-80% automation, and the rest will be done in due course.” He said, adding currently 80-90 percent of intending pilgrims have been communicated through the Hajj App, shared information about their flights, accommodation, vaccination and visa approval.\nAll intending pilgrims, the director said, would be accommodated in residential buildings located in Markazia, from where Masjid e Nabvi and Roza-e-Rasool (SAW) are at just 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.\nAhmed Nadeem said over 8,000 Pakistanis have so far contacted the ministry through the Hajj app to discuss their issues regarding the spiritual journey, which have been cleared within no time, and a few are at various stages of resolution. “So far, over 60,000 are active users of the Hajj App, while the number of intending pilgrims under the government scheme stands at 67,000-plus.”\nApproximately 179,210 Pakistani pilgrims will perform their religious obligation under both government and private schemes, and the month-long pre-Hajj flight operation is slated to take off on May 9, ferrying pilgrims to the revered destinations in KSA.",
