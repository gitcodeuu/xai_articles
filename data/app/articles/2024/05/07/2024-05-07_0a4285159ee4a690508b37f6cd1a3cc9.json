The PM’s Committee on Climate Change is focussed on enhancing dialogue on war footing to shift towards green energy, financing and sustainable practices,” she added.\nThe PM’s Coordinator highlighted that Pakistan’s textile and other industries would face challenges due to CBAM and therefore, the government is increasing discussion to facilitate the process and combat with its lurking risks.\nThe Climate Change Ministry’s role was pivotal in this regard and was engaging with Economic Affairs, Commerce, Power, Planning and all others ministries, she added.\nRomina said different organisations were working in silos that needed to be collated for a holistic response to the existential threat of climate change.\nExecutive Director, SDPI, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said the country is grappling with multifaceted challenges further aggravated by economic crunch, climate change and CBAM possible impacts.\nHe said the government was aware of the situation and therefore, the Prime Minister has constituted committees on climate governance and finance review along with high-powered committee co-chaired by Deputy Chairman Planning Commission and PM Coordinator on Climate change.\nHe said the CBAM started by EU from October 2023 on iron, fertilizer, cement, green hydrogen, steel and others whereas by January 2024 more sectors would be added to CBAM and those countries exporting to EU will have to pay carbon tax.\n“Pakistan has to converge all its sectors on one point and provide level playing field for its industries to choose clean and green energy and invest in just energy transition,” he said.\nThe speakers including government representatives, textile industry leaders, experts, academia and other also provided their insights during various panel discussions.",
