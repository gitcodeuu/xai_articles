Both the terrorists and their facilitators were controlled from Afghanistan, while the suicide bomber was also an Afghan national.\nHe said the Pakistan Army strongly condemned “this ugly game of terrorism” and was “taking all necessary actions to bring its facilitators to justice”.\nThe DG ISPR said that in the war on terrorism, Pakistani soldiers, workers and personnel of law enforcement agencies were martyred in huge numbers.\n“Everyone knows that Pakistan tried its best for peace in the region and especially in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s role has been the most vital for peace in the region. Pakistan has been hosting Afghan refugees for a long time and has helped the Afghan refugees more than other country, which the world has also recognized,” he underlined.\nMajor General Sharif said despite all the efforts by Pakistan and despite pointing it out to the Afghan interim government on the state level, “the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) terrorists are continuously committing acts of terrorism in Pakistan”.\nPakistan, he said, had provided concrete evidence but no action from the Afghan authorities could have been seen as yet. There was evidence that the recent terrorism in Pakistan had its links to terror hideouts in Afghanistan.\nHe reiterated that Pakistan had always helped Afghanistan and reminded the interim government in Kabul that one of its pledges made to Pakistan by was not to let the Afghan soil be used for any terror acts against the latter.\nThe DG ISPR said that there was credible evidence that the TTP terrorists were still using the Afghan soil for launch attacks into Pakistan. In that regard, he mentioned, the Foreign Office had registered 12 protests.\nThe Army Chief had taken a clear stance that Pakistan had reservations on the hideouts of banned outfits in Afghanistan, he added.\n“Pakistan will leave no stone unturned to eradicate terror networks and provide protection to its citizens at all costs,” the ISRP DG said.\nHe said that the Armed Forces of Pakistan would go to any extent to suppress the terrorists and their patrons and facilitators as it was their mission to establish peace in the country.\nThe DG ISPR said that the terrorists and their enablers were busy in attempting to deteriorate the law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\n“In January 2024, BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) terrorists attacked Mach Frontier Corps camp, which the security forces thwarted with bravery. In this attack, four soldiers, including two policemen embraced martyrdom while 24 terrorists were killed,” he mentioned.\nOn March 16, he said, a North Waziristan checkpost was attacked, and in the ensuing exchange of fire, seven soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Kashif and Captain Ahmed, embraced martyrdom while six terrorists were killed.\nHe said Pakistan, in response, carried out counter-attacks in Afghanistan’s border areas and targeted safe havens of terrorists, in which eight terrorists were killed, who were involved in numerous terror acts in the country.\nHe said on March 25, another soldier was martyred in a terror attack in Turbat while four terrorists were eliminated.\nThe DG ISPR said a terrorist named Habibullah son of Khan Mohammad, who was captured in an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Pishin district on April 23, admitted to committing terror acts in Pakistan.\nSo far in the year 2024, he said, the security forces had collectively conducted 13,135 small and major intelligence-based operations against terrorists and their facilitators, killing 249 terrorists and arresting 396.\n“The Pakistan Army, police, intelligence agencies and other law enforcement forces are carrying out more than 100 operations on a daily basis against terrorists.”\nDuring the operations in the ongoing year, he said, two officers and 60 soldiers of the Pakistani forces had embraced martyrdom.\nThe DG ISPR spoke about the drive to repatriate illegal Afghans to their own country.\n“The decision to send back foreign citizens residing in Pakistan illegally was made by the Government of Pakistan in the larger national interest,” he added.\n“There was added burden on the country’s economy, while the law and order situation in the country was also deteriorating. In no country in the world, illegal immigrants are allowed to roam freely. So far, 563,639 illegal Afghan citizens have returned to their country, yet hundreds of thousands are still living in Pakistan.”\nAs regards India, he said that the country’s top civil and army leadership was well aware of multiple threats from the neighbour on the eastern border, where plans were  underway to divert attention from its internal violence as usual.\n“In the current year, there have been multiple violations of ceasefire by India on a small scale, which include 120 incidents of speculative fire, 15 airspace violations and 59 technical air violations,” he said.\n“The Indian army is targeting innocent citizens in Azad Jammu and Kashmir on the Line of Control (LoC) but the Pakistan Army has given a befitting response and will keep on doing so. We are ready to defend our sovereignty at all times and at all costs.”\nHe said the Indian army was also targeting innocent citizens in the Indian-held Kashmir.\n“The Pakistan Army has given a befitting response to the Indian aggression on the LoC and will keep on doing so,” DG ISPR Sharif said.\nPakistan was always ready to defend its sovereignty, he reaffirmed.\nMajor General Sharif said the world was seeing the Indian army targeting innocent civilians in Kashmir. It had tried to silence the Kashmiris’ democratic voice through oppression.\nHe said when the Indian Supreme Court announced the “pre-written” verdict last year maintaining Article 370, it proved that India was “openly violating” the United Nations resolutions.\nThe DG ISPR said that the Indian government was involved in international crimes which included the targeted killing of Indian-origin Sikhs.\n“The Indian agencies have also killed Pakistani citizens Shahid Latif and Muhammad Riaz on the directives of the Indian government,” he said, adding that there was credible evidence of communication between Indian agents and the killings on the Pakistani soil.\nHe stated that the Foreign Office had also given a press briefing in that regard.\nMajor General Sharif said that Pakistan had emerged as an effective voice on the global stage among several Muslim countries for the Gazans. In a meeting with the Palestinian ambassador, the Army Chief had called for an immediate ceasefire and vowed to continue speaking on the issue, he added.\nHe said that the Army Chief had declared that the Palestinian people had the full diplomatic, moral and political support of the Pakistani people.\n“We will continue speaking up for viable solutions to the Palestinian issue and their land,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
