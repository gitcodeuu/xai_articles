He stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tendered his resignation from the position of party president on May 11, 2024, mentioning reasons for his resignation and explaining that in 2017, under a conspiracy, Nawaz Sharif was removed and false cases were made against him. “Shehbaz Sharif further said that he wanted to entrust the party leadership back to Nawaz Sharif as all fake cases against him have come to an end,” he added.\nRana Sanaullah said that following Shehbaz Sharif’s resignation, a meeting of the central working committee was held on May 18, as per the party constitution. The committee asked Shehbaz Sharif to continue his responsibilities until the election of a new president and also constituted an election commission to hold the elections, he added.\nHe mentioned that May 28 was the last day for the submission of nomination papers and ten nomination papers were received during the stipulated time, wherein Nawaz Sharif was nominated as a candidate.\nHe explained that in this situation, Nawaz Sharif was the only candidate whose papers had been received and approved.

At this, all the participants present in the general council meeting fully supported the resolution.\nEarlier, while addressing the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said that in 2017, their leader was disqualified.
