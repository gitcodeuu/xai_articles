  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 13 (APP):Professor Abdul Rashid Gatrad OBE, a highly respected Consultant Paediatrician in Britain, has urged the Pakistan to impart vocational training to the most underprivileged children, aligning this initiative with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nAs CEO of Midland International Trust (MIAT), Professor Abdul Rashid Gatrad and his team raised £3 million for health projects worldwide. Notably, they built a cleft hospital in Pakistan’s Gujarat region, featured in an ITV documentary. Operations and services are free, supported by donors in the West Midlands.\nGatrad’s extensive charity work spans over 20 countries, focusing on healthcare, education, and sustainability.\nHe advocates for girls’ empowerment and has received honors for his contributions.\nGatrad’s efforts include setting up medical facilities, providing free surgeries, and supporting vocational training.\nHe emphasized the importance of sustainable development goals and continues his philanthropic work at 78, aiming to leave a legacy of hope and service to humanity\nThe Professor of Paediatrics and Child Health at three universities – University of Birmingham, Universities of Kentucky and Wolverhampton – was awarded with the OBE from the Queen in 2002 for services to ethnic minority children in the Midlands and in 2014 was made deputy Lieutenant to Her Majesty the Queen for his services.\nIn the same year he was made Freeman of the Borough of Walsall for halving the death rate in new-born babies and for his part in the research into the Hepatitis Vaccine that was subsequently rolled out globally.\nBorn originally in India but working in Pakistan, in 2003 Prof Gatrad met Khwaja Mohammed Aslam, a Pakistani bus driver and a businessman, who was the chairman of Midland International Aid Trust UK (MIAT). He invited him in 2005 to be the CEO.\nSince then, the charity has made a huge difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands around the world – particularly children.\nAt the time MIAT only had £20,000 of working capital and Pakistan was the only country where humanitarian aid was provided.  Since then, Rashid has sacrificed time, effort, energy and money to make MIAT truly global – now in over 20 countries.\nProfessor Abdul Rashid Gatrad, who started as postman before becoming a doctor in 1971, largely financed through MIAT this- state of the art 3-storey hospital which houses, audiology, speech therapy, dental services 2 wards and 2 operating theatres.\nThe hospital is supported by 4 doctors running round the clock operations and providing free medical aid to patients of the area, including those who travel from far and wide.\nThe hospital grounds have playing facilities. Then it was in 2016 when during a visit to Gujarat that he met a female teenage street beggar on crutches. She had clubbed feet that were bare and bleeding.\nThis led to Professor Rashid Gatrad setting up the clubfoot centre where now hundreds are being treated from birth – avoiding operations when older.\nHe said: “I request the Government of Pakistan to pay attention to vocationally train children and youth to empower them, especially girls. This will be good for Pakistan’s long-term development. Currently, there is no focus on this area. We are prepared to work with Pakistan to support the effort.\nWe have completed a huge maternity and a children’s hospital named after my mother Jubaida in Gujarat, Pakistan which now is dedicated to cleft operations.  This hospital is a demonstration of what can be achieved. Our charity goal is to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes from sustainable projects for thousands of the most disadvantaged populations in over 20 countries across Africa and Asia.”\nHe said: “The Jubaida Gatrad hospital was completed in 2015 and now provides employment to many. MIAT has provided medical equipment, and the hospital is attracting more and more people to Gujarat city.\nAfter I set up the club foot centre at this hospital in 2016, Ruth Lawson from the British High Commission attended its inaugural opening to witness the highly trained international cleft/clubfoot surgical team from the UK that I had assembled.\nThe Overseas Plastic Surgery Appeal (OPSA) team of 20 strong travels twice a year to Pakistan.\nAll give up their time free for projects in which I have led the development of a very clear and targeted model of interventions – namely an integrated and multi-sectoral pathway of care of children that resources local healthcare capacities to screen them, and in the process provide children access to education through, for example, help with hearing and speech therapy. Now an intensive care centre is under construction, funded my MIAT.\nThe director of Deafkidz International, Steve Crump visited the centre in 2017 and hailed it as a revolutionary set up for a facility like that in Pakistan. Over subsequent 3 years he helped develop the audiology services.\nThe professor said “Collaborating with Deafkidz International, we have screened 20,000 children with deafness, in Punjab, Pakistan. Now 20 million people in the Sindh district have access to this service that I helped set up and facilitated. Improving such disabilities and supporting education, particularly for girls, ensures that children take their rightful place in society and do not beg on the streets with a potential for abuse and trafficking..”\nHe said: “Over the last 15 years, in addition to the cleft and club foot centres we have set up in Pakistan , a breast care service for women, an artificial limb fitting centre, which houses the club foot centre named after my father Mahomed Gatrad, cataract camps, hearing services for the new-born, dental services and an outreach clinic for elderly and pregnant women in Sooklan Gujrat.\nThe veteran doctor’s work extends to over 20 countries, including Somalia, Malawi, Gambia, Syria, Bangladesh, Haiti, the Dem Rep of Congo, and Nepal where he provided 1000 huts for families with children, the elderly and the disabled, after the earthquake in 2014. ‘’A lot of my international work is funded from my NHS salary donated through the GAYE scheme over the last 15 years. In addition, I get strong financial support from connections with the business people world-wide in countries such as Dubai, UK, S Africa etc.”\nThe doctor explained that through MIAT projects, he has arranged over 5000 cataract operations in Pakistan, Kashmir and Malawi; delivered over 500 cataract operations in Bangladesh; carried out 40 operations in Sierra Leone on teenage girls with vaginal fistulae; delivered food provisions, fresh water and blankets to refugees in Syria, Jordon, Kenya and Lebanon; built a 3Km fresh water pipeline in a village in Somalia; built houses in Malawi in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan after the floods and supported vocational training projects in Sierra Leone, Malawi, Turkey, India, Kashmir and Pakistan.\nHe added: “over the last 10 years I have been providing two ‘Gatrad Bursaries’ per year to doctors and nurses who travel abroad to train and teach.”  Professor Abdul Rashid Gatrad regularly travels to Gujarat to train and teach nurses in the care of new-born babies. He has trained more than 1200 nurses over the last 15 years and some of the nurses he trained now work in England and Europe in the medical profession.\nOver 6 years ago he set up WASUP – World Against Single Use Plastic which incorporates impacts of climate change.\nHe has fought tooth and nail to decrease plastic pollution through Refuse, Reduce Reuse and Recycle principles. He has given talks to many august organisations including UNESCO on these subjects. WASUP is now in over 50 countries.\nAt 78 he is still full of enthusiasm to make a difference to the lives of the needy, Professor Abdul Rashid Gatrad plans to visit Pakistan  again with a hope of meeting  government  officials to raise the profile for his charity’s campaign for vocational education for some of the most downtrodden sections of the society.\nThe renowned doctor remains determined to continue as a charity worker till his last breath. He said: “Since a young age, I have considered the struggle of the thousands of disadvantaged around the world as my own. I have the courage and conviction of not succumbing to despair and defeat but to rise to challenges with an ever-increasing resolve.\nI believe I have improved lives and brought joy to thousands of people in practical, lifesaving and life-enhancing ways. I have done nothing for self-aggrandisement. This is for humanity, and to leave a legacy of bringing hope and serving humanity. ”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
