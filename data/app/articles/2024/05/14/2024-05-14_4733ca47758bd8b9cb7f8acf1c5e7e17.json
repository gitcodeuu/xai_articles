Among these, 20 buses are being repaired to serve the transportation needs of students and teachers.\nThe addition of these 20 buses will complement the fleet of pink buses previously announced, thereby addressing the transportation requirements of students and teachers in Islamabad Capital Territory.\nAdditionally, the National Assembly passed a resolution to extend the Apostille Ordinance 2024 for an additional 120 days.",
