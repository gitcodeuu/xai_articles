He also emphasized the necessity of properly covering head with a wet cloth or cap to maintain a sensation of evaporation and cooling while exposed to the sun.\nFor those engaged in continuous outdoor activities, he advised taking regular breaks, resting in shaded areas, and staying hydrated by drinking water at frequent intervals.\nHowever, he cautioned against consuming unsafe and low-quality summer drinks from roadside vendors.  “These drinks, made from substandard ingredients and served in unhygienic ways, can increase the risk of infections like diarrhea and vomiting,” he said.\nHe recommended opting for locally prepared drinks like Lassi, especially when salt is added, but stressed the importance of ensuring cleanliness during preparation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
