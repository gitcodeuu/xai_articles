He emphasized that Pakistan was established on the ideology of Islam and religion, and in terms of constitution and law,  because its laws are made considering Islamic rules and regulations, and any laws conflicting with Shariah can be challenged in the Shariat Court.\nHe appreciated the suggestion of establishing an institution to ponder over new emerging issues, stating that the doors of the Shariat Court will always be opened for legal support and guidance.\nSahibzada Muhammad Qamar-ul-Haq remarked that Ijtihad is the wealth of Islamic thought, and new issues can only be resolved through Ijtihad.
