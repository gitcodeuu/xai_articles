She called for enhanced efforts in processing, packaging, livestock management, and healthcare services.\n“To reduce poverty, we must improve our skill programs and take concrete steps towards better processing, packaging, livestock, and healthcare facilities. The world demands trained and skilled people, and we are committed to fulfilling this need,” she said.\nBesides, Chairperson Rubina Khalid also met Deputy Speaker Balochistan Assembly, Ghazala Gola.\nDuring the meeting, the problems faced by women beneficiaries of BISP were discussed. Ghazala Gola assured Chairperson Rubina Khalid that the provincial government of Balochistan will play its full role in providing all possible facilities to the deserving women of BISP in the payment centers.\nLater, Rubina Khalid along with Director General Balochistan Abdul Jabbar also visited BISP payment centers and Benazir Nashonuma Center in Nawakali and Sariab.\nRubina Khalid interacted with the deserving women who came there to collect the money and listened to their problems.\nOn this occasion, Rubina Khalid while talking about the health of women said that the health of young women is badly affected due to the birth of more children or less interval in the birth of children. Therefore, proper interval in the birth of children is very important.\nShe said that due to non-availability of nutritious food in women during pregnancy, children suffer from fatal diseases like stunting. BISP is playing an important role for better health of women and their children under its Nashonuma program.\nChairperson Rubina Khalid directed the staff to pay the money on priority basis to the elderly and women with small children and to improve the arrangements for the deserving women so that they do not face any problem.\nRubina Khalid asked the women to visit the payment center only after receiving a message from BISP official number 8171.\nThe total amount of Kafaalat stipend is Rs. 10,500/-. The women must count and receive the full amount, ask for the bank receipt and in case of any complaint immediately register their complaint on BISP helpline number 080026477, she added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
