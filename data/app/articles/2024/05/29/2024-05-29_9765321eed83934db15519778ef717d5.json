  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP): Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) is all set to launch a new satellite PakSat MM1 on May 30 through the support of China, in accordance with the National Space Program 2047.\nThe Project Management Team of Paksat MM1 has finalized all the arrangements for the launch of this new satellite through evaluating its performance.\nProject Director, PakSat MM1, M. Imran said “Our team is very excited for the upcoming launch of PakSat MM1 on May 30”.\nThe satellite PakSat MM1, conceived keeping in sight the growing needs of the country in the broad spectrum of communication and connectivity, would be launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XSLC), China.\nThis satellite project is a hallmark of technological cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and Pakistan and is expected to revolutionise communication in Pakistan and serve as a giant leap towards a digitally connected Pakistan.\nBased on advanced communication technologies, PakSat MM1 will play a pivotal role in the socio-economic uplift of the country and will prove to be a stepping stone in the transformation of the country into Digital Pakistan.\nThe launch ceremony will be shown live for media from the Islamabad and Karachi establishments of Suparco.\nThe satellite is expected to contribute to the establishment of a sophisticated communication network and help meet the growing demands of the telecom sector and its advanced capabilities will address the increasing demand for high-speed internet and seamless connectivity.\nSUPARCO says “This high-power multi-mission satellite will provide communication services in C, Ku, Ka Bands and SBAS services in L Band. Based on advanced communication technologies, PakSat-MM1 will play a pivotal role in the socio-economic uplift of the country. It will prove to be a stepping stone in the transformation of the country into Digital Pakistan. It will provide various communication services like broadband internet, TV broadcasting, Mobile bank –hauling and VSAT connectivity”.\nProject Manager MM-1, SUPARCO, Usman Iftikhar, said that the primary objective behind the PAKSAT MM-1 satellite is to strengthen Pakistan’s communication infrastructure would pave the way for broadening the horizons for connectivity, serving the unserved, Tele-education, E-health/Tele-medicine, E-governance and E-commerce while transforming Pakistan into a digital powerhouse.\nHe said that communication infrastructure is the backbone of any country and plays an important role in the development of the country and this satellite will help provide connectivity to the remote areas of the country. This satellite is a communication satellite that will be sent in a Geostationary Orbit.\nEarlier, Pakistan’s historic lunar mission (ICUBE-Q) was launched on May 3 on board China’s Chang’E6 from Hainan, China.\nThe satellite iCube-Qamar mission marked Pakistan’s first lunar exploration effort which is a significant milestone for the country’s space endeavours.\nThe satellite iCube-Q was designed and developed by the Institute of Space Technology (IST) in collaboration with China’s Shanghai University SJTU and Pakistan’s national space agency SUPARCO. The satellite, weighing about 7kg, was developed by the Electrical Engineering Department of the Institute of Space Technology (IST) in Islamabad.\nThe satellite successfully captured and transmitted its inaugural images from lunar orbit, providing a unique perspective of the moon’s surface.\nRegarding the benefits of satellites, Suparco said that satellites play a vital role in improving communication, enhancing navigation, monitoring the environment, advancing scientific knowledge, and supporting various aspects of daily life, making them indispensable for humanity’s progress and well-being.\nSatellites are incredibly beneficial for humanity in communication, navigation, weather forecasting, earth observations, scientific research, disaster management, remote sensing, and telemedicine.\nThree types of satellites are required for any country, firstly for communication, secondly for remote sensing and reconnaissance, and thirdly for navigation.",
