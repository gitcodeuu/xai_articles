  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP):The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on Wednesday has conducted an Independent Quality of Service (QoS) Survey in sixteen cities across Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to measure the performance of Cellular Mobile Operators (CMOs).\nSurvey routes covered main roads, service roads, and various sectors, with 2,270 kilometers traveled per CMO over 60 days said a news release. Mobile handsets in auto-detect mode were used for voice calls, SMS, and mobile broadband/data sessions.\nThe survey included 0.25 million mobile broadband tests, 45,000 calls and SMS tests, and 0.13 million Ookla speed tests using advanced QoS monitoring tools, ensuring compliance with NGMS licenses and the Cellular Mobile Network QoS Regulations 2021.\nCMOs were ranked based on compliance with key performance indicators (KPIs) in mobile network coverage and voice services, from 1st to 4th positions. In the mobile broadband speed segment, rankings were determined by data download/upload speeds, network latency, and web page loading times. Jazz, Ufone, and Zong jointly secured 1st place in mobile network coverage, while Zong led in mobile broadband speed (Ookla).\nJazz was ranked 1st in mobile broadband speed (auto mode testing) and voice services. These rankings are for specific surveyed areas and not across the country. The results showed that largely CMOs comply with upload/download speed standards, with improvements in network latency and web page loading times compared to previous surveys.\nHowever, some voice KPIs were below the licensed thresholds in certain areas. Operators using advanced technologies like LTE Carrier Aggregation and Voice over LTE offered better service quality. PTA has instructed operators to take corrective measures to enhance service quality.\nThis monitoring activity is a regular feature for assessment of QoS and aims to encourage better mobile services and promote healthy competition among operators.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
