It has heightened Pakistan’s threat perception and security concerns, and it could spark a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region.”\nFormer Vice Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral (R) Khan Hasham Bin Saddique elaborated on the great power competition in the IOR. He discussed the strategic significance of the IOR, and the military dimensions shaping the region’s environment.\nHe underscored the nontraditional challenges that accompany this competition, including piracy, terrorism, and human trafficking, which complicated the already tense maritime security landscape.\nHe provided a broad overview of geopolitical\ntensions and underscored the need for cooperative security frameworks to address these multifaceted challenges.\nDirector General, Arms Control and Disarmament Affairs (ACDA), SPD, Brigadier Zahir Kazmi shared his insights on the Indian sea-based nuclear capabilities and their impact on deterrence stability. He elaborated on how India was expanding its nuclear weapons capabilities at sea, and how it could undermine regional deterrence and could potentially lead to an arms race, increasing conflict risk. India’s unconstrained military capabilities, including MIRV, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, pose threats to power.\nDespite bilateral agreements, tensions persist, and India’s inadequate safety system warranted consideration, he stressed.\nNIMA Vice President Baber Bilal Haider explored India’s maritime ambitions and emphasized on India’s strategic culture, which was influenced by historical and ideological factors and drives its current politics.\nHis analysis extended beyond security concerns to include regional stability and economic cooperation. He stressed that India’s economic strategy involved importing, managing choke points, recognizing its economic might, and establishing a strong military base in the IOR.\nRear Admiral (R) Syed Faisal Ali Shah discussed Pakistan’s ambitions and achievements in enhancing its maritime capabilities and securing its interests amidst regional challenges.\nHis remarks emphasized the strategic importance of the Gwadar Port and its potential to transform regional trade dynamics while also addressing the security threats posed by India’s naval buildup.\nHe stressed according due cognizance to the importance of maritime domain and shifting the strategic focus accordingly.\nThe session concluded with an engaging interactive discussion and dynamic Q&A.",
