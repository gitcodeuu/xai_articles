The workers or labourers working at different sites should be provided water as it is extremely hot and unusual situation that could lead to serious emergency,” she urged the masses.\nShe commended that the early warning system of the NDMA under its National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) was the strongest in the world and it provided 24/7 data that guides the national and provincial entities and the general public at large.\nTechnical expert, Dr Tayyab from NDMA informed that global climate transition left Pakistan as the fifth most vulnerable country due to climate change.\nThe NDMA had developed first ever disaster calendar of the country with six months projections of summers and winters projecting separate natural calamities, he added.\nHe mentioned that January and February this year observed rainfall below normal and below normal snowfall, whereas erratic rainfall happened in April that occurred in other countries as well and also the torrential rains that pounded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan provinces.\nHe mentioned that the NEOC had developed the complete guidelines of heatwave that projected extreme prevalence of rising temperature impacts in the plains of South Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan namely Umerkot, Tharparkar, Tando Allah Yar, Mitiari, Sanghar, Dadu, Jacobabad, Badin, Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur, Kashmore, Kachi, Lehri, Jhal Magsi, Lasbela, Bhawalpur, Rahimyar Khan, Lahore, Multan, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Rajanpur, and Lodhran.\nHe highlighted that water stress was one of the major issues during heatwave as water consumption increased during heatwave as continuous water consumption required to avoid dehydration.\nHowever, drought was another disaster linked to heatwave as groundwater aquifers depletion impact human life and agriculture whereas Tharparkar and Jacobabad were facing mild drought situations that could also trigger agricultural drought, he added.\nResponding to media queries, Romina Khurshid said the Prime Minister had formed a high level joint committee under his leadership that was in liaison with all the relevant authorities to keep the national forum abreast of prevailing climate catastrophes.\nReplying to APP, Member, DRR, NDMA, Idrees Mahsud said that in-time preparedness, information sharing and awareness were the basics of disaster management and therefore an android mobile application was under preparation that would be accessible to general public and media for all alerts, advisories, plans and SOPs on disasters.\nHe also informed that the Chairman NDMA through the national emergencies operation cell was in direct contact with the Director Generals of all provincial disaster management authorities with both hybrid and virtual modes to share knowledge and guide decision making processes in disasters.\nThe national coordination cell as a forum had coordination with all local, provincial authorities, and donors and international agencies on various issues at the NDMA, he added.",
