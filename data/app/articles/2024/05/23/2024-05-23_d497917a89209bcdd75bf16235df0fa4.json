  "content": "ABU DHABI, May 23 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that he had broken the begging bowl as no nation had ever achieved prosperity through the begging bowl or aid rather through sacrifice and hard work.\n“Gone are the days when I will go to a brotherly country with a begging bowl. I have broken that bowl. The bowl will lead us nowhere. When was the last time that a country prospered through aid and bowls? Only the nations made their mark and left indelible footprints through sacrifice, hard work, sweat and blood,” he said addressing a roundtable conference on “Innovate together: UAE-Pakistan Tech Collaboration” during his daylong visit here.\nThis event was organized by Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) and Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) in collaboration with Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication and Pakistan Embassy in Abu Dhabi.\nThe event was attended by representatives and heads of Information Technology (IT) companies based in UAE as well as Pakistani IT experts.\nThe prime minister, who was on his daylong visit to the UAE said that in his scheduled meeting with the UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, he would not seek any loan but joint collaboration and joint investments to have mutual benefits for investors.\nExplaining the parameters of his government’s program, he said the Pakistani workers would be imparted the highest standard of vocational training so that they come to UAE and open their offices, provide remote services and make livelihood.\n“I am prepared to take that risk because nothing can be achieved without taking risks.

I have an iron resolve to completely transform the economy of Pakistan in collaboration with UAE, be it a joint venture, collaboration or knowledge-sharing partnership.”\nLauding the contribution and efforts of around 1.5 million Pakistani diaspora in the UAE, the prime minister urged them to learn the expertise and experiences of the Emirates to replicate them for Pakistan’s progress and prosperity.\nHe recalled strong institutional and people-to-people linkages between the two countries.

He shared the commitment of his government for improving investment ecosystem in digital economy of the country and invited investors to visit Pakistan.\nThe event concluded with the distribution of mementos amongst the UAE-based clients of Pakistani IT companies in recognition of their contribution and strengthening of business-to-business cooperation.\nThe event was also attended by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, Minister for Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja and SAPM Syed Tariq Fatemi.",
