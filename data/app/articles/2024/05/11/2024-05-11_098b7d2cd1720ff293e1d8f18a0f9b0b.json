The aim is to simplify procedures and associated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to enhance user experience.\nOnce fully revamped, the centre will offer state-of-the-art facilities, enabling residents to easily access information and services in a streamlined and efficient manner.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
