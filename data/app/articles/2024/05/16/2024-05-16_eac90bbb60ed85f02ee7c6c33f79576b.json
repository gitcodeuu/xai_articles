The findings revealed that even individuals with genetic diseases can lead healthier and longer lives by maintaining a better lifestyle.\nExperts concluded that by adopting a healthy lifestyle, genetic disorders can be managed more effectively, potentially extending life expectancy by up to six years. Key lifestyle changes include getting sufficient sleep, regular exercise, eating healthy foods, and avoiding smoking and alcohol.\nThe experts collected data from records and analyzed the participants’ lifestyles, health changes, and the development of illnesses.\nThe study divided the participants into three different groups to evaluate the impact of lifestyle choices on their health.
