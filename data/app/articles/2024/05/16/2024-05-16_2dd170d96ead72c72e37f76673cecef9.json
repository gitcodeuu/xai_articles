Umro Ayyar’s journey becomes a testament to the power of forging bonds that transcend racial, gender, class, age, and personality differences.\nBesides the animated film, Ingenuity Productions is also working on another 3D animated series titled ‘Science Voyagers.’ This series depicts a curious boy embarking on time-traveling adventures to meet history’s scientific greats.\nAdditionally, the company is credited for producing two 2D animated series: ‘Aria and the Magic Jungle,’ focusing on environmental awareness, and ‘Yolki and Hatch,’ centered around childhood development.\n“We want to put the potential of the Pakistani animation industry on display on the world stage. We’re confident that the film’s stunning visuals and story will captivate audiences worldwide,” said Haris Basharat, Ingenuity Production’s CEO.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
