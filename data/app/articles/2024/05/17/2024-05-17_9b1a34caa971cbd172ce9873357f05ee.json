  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 17 (APP): Minister for Information, Broadcasting, National Heritage and Culture Attaullah Tarar on Friday said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government was making a botch attempt to maintain its credibility by attributing a false statement to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\nThe minister, in a statement, said that the KP Food Minister had attributed a false statement to the prime minister which was based on assumptions and contrary to the facts.\nHe said the KP government wanted to confront with the Federal Government by consistently churning out lies especially about electricity, wheat and other crops.\nHe regretted that the KP chief minister had been persistently threatening “to attack Islamabad and seize the Peshawar Electricity Supply Company”.\nHe had even given a 15-day deadline to the Federal Government in that regard, the minister added.\nTarar said their “nefarious designs” would not succeed as the Federal Government was fully capable to protect state institutions and public property.\nNobody would be allowed to take the law into their hands, he said, vowing that a strict action would be taken against those would dare to do so.\nHe said the Federal Government would continue to play its due role in protecting the rights of KP people and ensuring the provision of resources for their welfare according to the Constitution, regardless of political differences.",
