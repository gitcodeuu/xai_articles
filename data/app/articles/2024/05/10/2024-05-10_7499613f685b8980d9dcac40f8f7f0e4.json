During the summer months, all air handling units (AHUs) operate at peak efficiency to maintain this ideal range. Conversely, winter sees a significant reduction in AHU usage due to the naturally cooler climate, SPA reported.\nFresh air is drawn from the Grand Mosque’s rooftop and undergoes a multi-stage purification process.
