He said that the price of roti should be decreased with the price of flour.\nThe court said that it also has to view the interest of poor people, adding that it is hard for the workers to roost roti in extreme hot weather.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer prayed the court to suspend the new notification.\nFurther hearing of the case was then adjourned.",
