By nurturing the green skills of our youth and empowering them to implement innovative solutions, we are not only addressing immediate environmental challenges but also shaping the leaders of tomorrow who will drive lasting change.”\nDr. Ejaz Ahmad, Senior Program Fellow, IoU emphasized the need to reshape urban development paradigms through strategic partnerships, collaborative efforts, development of green skills, and equitable transitions.\nMarfaa Naseem, the GUDS grant winner from QAU, said that she has harvested 48,000 liters of rainwater since installing the system in January 2024, saving around PKR 12,000 compared to tanker fees. She also highlightes how the grant money helped her set up a hydroponic farm at her rooftop in Ghouri Town where she has planted around 230 plants in a limited area.\nDr. Jabir Hussain Syed, Associate Professor COMSATS said that GUDS provided a great platform to students to channelize their creative thinking into designing innovative solutions for urban environmental issues.\nA total of four innovative solutions pertaining to urban water management, solid waste management and green infrastructure were submitted by the GUDS participants at COMSATS who had undergone the 2 month capacity-building sessions.\nAfter a rigorous evaluation two projects were chosen for grant award of PKR 500,000 each. The first project will focus on green infrastructure while the second will focus on water conservation. Out of these two, the project which will show greater potential for scalability at the end of two months will further be supported technically and financially.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
