We will further facilitate this by focusing on developing standards in the capital market in Uzbekistan,” said Oleg Shvyrkov.\nJennifer Nordquist, a member of the Economic Innovation Group, emphasized that board members of companies should be familiar with the financial market as “Corporate governance is now developing in Uzbekistan”.\nHe said that various studies show that issues such as board composition, size and standing are being left behind.\nAlthough the corporate governance code was introduced many years ago, only a limited number of people use it, he added.\nThe code is weak, various aspects, board work, governance work, definitions are not properly developed. That is why the country should develop areas of the code such as governance, control and tariffs,” said Olzhas Omarov, KPMG Director for Central Asia and the Caucasus.",
