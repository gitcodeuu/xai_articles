Hopefully in the future, we can visit Indonesia to see more about Indonesia’s progress,” she remarked.\nThe first session started with the lecture of Ms. Chusnul Mariyah, Ph.D. from the Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Indonesia on “Indonesian Politics : Between Islam and Nationalism.” She highlighted the trends of oligarchy, nepotism, and abandoning merit system in political recruitment in Indonesian domestic politics.\nShe also stressed that democracy cannot be taken for granted, but it must be continuously pursued at all times. “Elections with integrity are very important.

Addressing hundreds of female students from women universities in Pakistan, Ms. Mariyah explained in detail on how to achieve certain position through halal ways.\nThe current OIP is more special this time since the Indonesian Embassy is collaborating with the consortium of 18 women universities throughout Pakistan.
