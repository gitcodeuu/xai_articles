During the meeting, Pakistan was unanimously elected as the Vice-Chair of the Bureau of Foreign Ministers’ Preparatory Meeting for 15th Islamic Summit of the OIC.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister congratulated the Gambian Foreign Minister Mamadou Tangara, on assuming the Chairmanship of the Session and 15th Islamic Summit and appreciated the role of the outgoing chair, the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nDar expressed Pakistan’s deep concern about the ongoing genocide and starvation of Gaza people and called for the reactivation of OIC’s Ministerial Committee on Israeli aggression against the Palestinians, offering Pakistan’s assistance to the body.\nThe deputy prime minister and foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s full support for the inalienable right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and stated that the only permanent solution to the current crisis lies in the creation of a secure, viable, contiguous, and sovereign state of Palestine based on the pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\nHe strongly condemned the oppressive actions in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) including extrajudicial killings and media blackouts. He pledged Pakistan’s unwavering diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination as mandated by relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.\nIshaq Dar stressed the imperative of joint action by the OIC to confront rising Islamophobia, which was manifested by an increasing number of incidents of discrimination, violence, and incitement against Muslims around the world.\nHe stated that while global social media platforms had set for themselves a clear understanding and the responsibility of content relating to “Antisemitism” and “Holocaust denial”, same was not the case for blasphemous and anti-Islamic content that was responsible for widespread distress among Muslims and the global wave of Islamophobia.\nThe deputy prime minister urged the OIC to formulate a joint strategy to influence global information networks/platforms particularly the global social media platforms to harmonize their application of content regulation policies for blasphemous, anti-Islamic and Islamophobic content.\nDuring the preparatory meeting, the OIC foreign ministers adopted the report of the Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM) and finalized various documents, including the Resolution on the Issue of Palestine, the Final Communique of the OIC Summit Conference and the Banjul Declaration.",
