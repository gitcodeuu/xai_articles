He also touched upon the concept of the ‘Thucydides Trap,’ the intensifying competition between the U.S. and China, as well as the impact of longstanding unresolved disputes such as Palestine and Kashmir on regional and global stability.\nHe also highlighted transnational terrorism; the critical food, fuel and financial crises (3Fs); and the existential threat posed by climate change. Additionally, he highlighted the effect of emerging technologies and the risks posed by their militarization.\nThe DG ISSI underscored the intrinsic link between internal strength and external influence and stressed that a stable polity, a robust economy, and nimble diplomacy, were indispensable to respond effectively to the current and future challenges and to realize the opportunities.\nEarlier, Director of the China-Pakistan Study Centre, Dr. Talat Shabbir provided an introduction of ISSI and its research work. He elaborated the Institute’s rich history, organizational structure, and core mission. He highlighted ISSI’s commitment to policy inputs, fostering dialogues, advocating for critical issues, extending outreach, and conducting in-depth analysis on various strategic matters.\nDuring the question-and-answer session, the “Azadi Fellows” and other attendees posed insightful questions, leading to a lively and informative discussion. Topics ranged from specific regional conflicts to broader global strategic trends, providing an opportunity for deeper understanding and exchange of ideas.\nAt the end of the discussion, President of IRCRA, Israr Madni, thanked ISSI for the opportunity for “Azadi Fellows” for an insightful discourse.
