The Regional Director informed the tutors about the official WhatsApp group created by the university at the number 0304-0378832.\nThis group will keep both students and tutors updated on the university’s educational activities.\nTutors can also use this WhatsApp number to quickly resolve their issues.\nAhsan Shakoor mentioned that the university’s education system has become fully digitalized.\nUnder the new system, the appointment of tutors is based purely on merit and is conducted through an automated system, with the regional offices playing a minimal role.\nHe asserted that digitalization had made things much easier for students, and he claimed that if students strictly follow the issued guidelines, they would face no difficulties from admission to obtaining their degrees.\nAssistant Regional Director, Tauseef Ahmed, introduced the tutors to the awareness portal. In his briefing, he explained in detail how to use the portal, check assignments, punch results, and submit bills.\nAt the end of the session, appointment letters and tutor bags were distributed to the 150 tutors of the Islamabad region.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
