Charging infrastructure has been set up at the Jinnah Convention Centre and Sector H-9, while the construction of a bus depot at Zero Point is underway, with groundbreaking expected soon.\nChairman Randhawa expressed satisfaction with the progress and directed the swift launch of the remaining 13 feeder routes.\nHe also called for the introduction of digital advertising boards in metro buses and terminals to generate additional revenue, reducing reliance on government subsidies while maintaining high-quality service.\nIn a move toward eco-friendly urban transport, the Chairman emphasized transitioning all commercial and private transport in Islamabad to electric vehicles.\nHe announced that the CDA’s entire bus fleet would be converted to electric in the first phase, with plans to engage public institutions and universities to adopt similar measures.\nTo ensure financial sustainability, Member Finance has been tasked with devising strategies to minimize subsidies.\nThe CDA also plans to collaborate with stakeholders to promote environmentally friendly transportation solutions.\nReaffirming the CDA’s commitment, Chairman Randhawa stated, “We aim to provide high-quality, affordable, and sustainable transport for the residents of Islamabad while leading the way in eco-friendly urban mobility.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
