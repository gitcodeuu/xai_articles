As a result, the test was conducted today by the NUST at its Islamabad Examination Centre.\nIt is pointed out that In June 2024 the Ministry of Law and Justice invited the applications from interested candidates to fill these vacancies. Approximately 300 applicants applied, and after thorough scrutiny under a revised procedure, 262 applicants were shortlisted to participate in the test.\nThe ATIR is a quasi-judicial forum that hears appeals against the orders passed by the Regional Commissioners/Commissioners of Inland Revenue Services (IRS). The Tribunal plays a critical role in ensuring effective tax recovery and resolution of disputes, directly influencing national revenue generation. Moreover, it is a pivotal step towards filling the key vacancies in ATIR through a merit-based and competitive process to expedite the resolution of tax related cases pending for years as the collection of taxes is essential for sustained economic development of the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
