Strengthening these councils is crucial for enhancing access to justice as many individuals, especially in rural and marginalized communities, face barriers in accessing formal courts due to high costs, procedural complexities, and geographic constraints.\nThe workshop served as a platform for diverse stakeholders, including representatives from the Dispute Resolution Councils (DRCs) from Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Battagram, Torghar, and Kohistan (Upper, Lower and Kolai Pallas), judiciary, law enforcement, civil society, and community leaders, to share insights and develop strategies for enhancing the capacity and efficiency of DRCs. The primary objective was to create a comprehensive action plan to empower DRCs as an effective mechanism for resolving disputes and improving access to justice across the region.\nDuring opening sessions Syed Raza Ali CEO Peace & Justice Network and Ms. Salma Zeb Legal Aid & ADR Officer, Rule of Law Program UNDP Pakistan highlighted that the strengthening of Dispute Resolution Councils (DRCs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is crucial in enhancing their ability to serve communities effectively in resolving disputes. By addressing existing gaps—such as inadequate resources, limited training for members, lack of inclusivity, and insufficient public awareness—DRCs can become more efficient, accessible, and responsive to community needs. Strengthened DRCs not only provide timely and cost-effective justice but also play a vital role in reducing the burden on formal courts and fostering social harmony at the grassroots level.\nMuhammad Shoaib, District & Session Judge Abbottabad, presented a comprehensive framework for strengthening Dispute Resolution Councils (DRCs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He emphasized that DRCs are a vital component of the justice system, offering alternative, community-driven solutions for resolving disputes efficiently and amicably.\nDPO Mansehra, Mr. Shafiullah Khan Gandapur, in his keynote address, emphasized the vital role played by DRC members in promoting justice and resolving disputes. He acknowledges their volunteer services and pledged his full support in addressing the challenges faced by DRCs.\nDuring the workshop, participants discussed challenges faced by DRCs in delivering justice and maintaining community trust as well as best practices for alternative dispute resolution tailored to the socio-cultural context of Hazara Division. They also presented recommendations for capacity building, inclusivity, and resource mobilization to strengthen DRCs.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
