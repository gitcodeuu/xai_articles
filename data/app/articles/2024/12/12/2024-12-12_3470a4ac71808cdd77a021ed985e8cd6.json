  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 12 (APP):Senator Muhammad Talal Chaudhry on Thursday said that the 26th Constitutional Amendment prevented PTI’s rebellion on November 24 from succeeding.\nParticipating in the Senate debate on the November 26 incidents, Talal said immediately after the violators entered Islamabad, a judicial bench would have been formed, putting law enforcement under scrutiny and allowing the rebellion to succeed.\nOutrightly rejecting PTI’s offer for reconciliation, he questioned why dialogue should be held with a party that portrayed the ruling parties as thieves and called parliament non-representative.\nHe said that convicted culprits should not be included in the dialogue, as the country suffered losses due to the nexus among General Faiz, Imran, and former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar.\nRecalling year 2014, when PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif made a reconciliation offer to PTI chief, their proposal to sign the Meesaq-e-Jamhoriat was outrightly dismissed as an attempt to seek an NRO like concessions.\nHe said PTI protesters were instructed to go to Sangjani, but they refused and chose to head to D Chowk instead.\nRegarding the PTI’s demand for formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he said it should trace back to the former President Musharraf era, when the founder of PTI served as a polling agent for Musharraf during his referendum.\nParticipating in debate, Dost Muhammad Khan of Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) said that they were not terrorists rather patriotic citizens of the country. Their forefathers rendered supreme sacrifices for this country, he added.\nTaking part in the discussion, Jam Muhammad of PPP said that the masses were looking towards the august forums (Senate and National Assembly) for resolution of their issues. “We have acumen leadership in the country and the issues should be settled through reconciliation,” he said.\nJam Muhammad said issues could not be resolved by use of forces rather it further aggravated peaceful environment. Law and order in Balochistan vitiated by use of force, he added.\nBarrister Syed Ali Zafar said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protestors on November 24-26 were peaceful and assembled to exercise their right to protest. He affirmed that PTI would continue to uphold this right.\nHe called for the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the facts surrounding the events of November 26.\nHe strongly denied that protestors were carrying weapons, asserting that PTI supporters were not terrorists. He also highlighted that the father of the nation, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, recognized protest as a fundamental right of the people, and the Constitution allows for peaceful protests.\nHe claimed that the Constitution was being implemented selectively, with only favorable judicial decisions being enforced.\nTo resolve issues, it is crucial that the door to dialogue remains open. Mutual confidence is essential to initiate discussions. The government should implement confidence-building measures to facilitate talks with the PTI. These measures must be taken before the dialogue begins.\nParliamentary Leader of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), Ms. Sherry Rehman stated that PTI rejected talks with the government and PPP in February 2024.\nShe emphasized that the PPP never resorted to violence in the country despite facing atrocities. She also noted that Z.A. Bhutto never compromised and accepted his hanging, adding that freedom always comes with responsibility.\nShe criticized PTI for the events of May 9, claiming that no party had ever acted in such a manner. She accused PTI of attacking the state and PTI should apologise from the state.\nSherry Rehman said the PTI should have protested in Sangjani and avoided violence at D Chowk, as space must not be given to violence. PTI’s call for civil disobedience remains intact.\nSenator Aimal Wali Khan claimed that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Shibli Faraz, had been compromised, as he was jailed for only one day and has always remained absent from the house during important legislation.\nThe people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have the right to benefit from the resources of the region.\nMohsin Aziz stressed the need to use Human Resources for making country prosperous. He called for unity to help the country progress and urged moving forward.\nMaulana Abdul Wasay of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) urged all political parties to hold dialogue for ending confrontation.\nThe debate on Nov 26 incidents will continue on Friday.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
