As almonds range from Rs 4,800 to Rs 5,600 per kg, while walnuts cost Rs 1400-1,800 per kg, Khan said adding that Cashews, figs, and pine nuts are priced at roundabout Rs 3,600, Rs 4,000, and Rs 14,000 per kg, respectively.\nHe specifically called peanuts the most affordable and best-selling product whose prices depend on the type of area where they were produced; he said that peanuts were produced in mainly three regions of the country: Parachinar, Chakwal, and Gujjar Khan, with prices of 1200, 720, and 640 per kg, respectively.\nA customer, Muhammad Ahmed, said that winter was the best season to consume these dry fruits as they gave enough energy and also reduced the effect of the cold air in this weather, he also called dry fruits a healthy diet in this season.\nA female customer said, “I want to purchase these dry fruits so that I can use them in the Gajar ka halwa for garnishing, taste and health perspective.\nThe sale of sweets in which these dry fruits were used was also enhanced due to the effect of the season.\nThe online sale of dry fruits has also seen a boost, with e-commerce platforms offering competitive prices. However, some online sellers face challenges with cancelled orders and increased costs.\nAn online store owner said, “Online selling of dry fruits is very appealing during winter.” Adding, “We offer very affordable and competitive prices.”\n“Most customers order online but when goods reach the addresses people usually cancel the order which raises the cost of the goods,” the owner added.\nThe supply of dry fruits involves sourcing from various regions, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Balochistan, and Punjab. Suppliers have reported increased costs due to transportation and farming expenses reason behind the rise in the prices of dry fruit.\nSupplier of dry fruit from Gilgit Baltistan, Wazir Hashmat told APP that he supplied dry fruit items from all parts of the country and sent them to Lahore, where the main market of dry fruits exists, adding that “We obtain pine nuts from Balochistan province, walnuts from Gilgit Baltistan & Balochistan, and peanuts from most of the parts of Punjab, and so on.\nHe also said that prices of dry fruit items increased at farmers’ end while other costs associated with transportation also enhanced its value.\nClinical Nutrition, Ayesha Haq told APP, “Dry fruit is a complete diet full of proteins and calories required by a healthy body” adding that dry fruits are nutrient-dense foods that contain high nutrients but relatively low in calories.\n“Nutrient-dense foods contain vitamins, minerals, complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and healthy fats that are also beneficial for children and old age people, especially in winter,” Haq said.\nShe added that the consumption of dry fruit items keeps the inner body temperature warm which escalated its value in the winter.\nShe focused on the consumption of at least one dry fruit item daily for the maintenance of health and also to keep the inner organs of the body warm.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
