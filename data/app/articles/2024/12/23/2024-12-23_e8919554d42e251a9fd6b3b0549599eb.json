These displays reflect the inclusive spirit of the season, fostering unity and joy among communities.\nThe Christmas tree, an iconic element of the festival, represents the hope, renewal, and togetherness that Christmas embodies. Traditionally, these trees—whether real or artificial—are embellished with ornaments such as shimmering baubles, gold and silver bells, radiant stars, pine cones, candies, tinsel, and balloons crafted from various materials, including glass and ceramic. Crowning the tree is often a star or angel, symbolizing the message of goodwill and the herald of peace.\n“This is my favorite part of Christmas,” shared Asiya Joseph, a young Christian girl. “Decorating the tree with family brings us together and fills our home with festive cheer. It’s a tradition that completes the essence of the celebration.”\nAsiya also shared how decorating the tree inspires hope and positivity in the time when the country is facing different challenges like of climate, economic etc.\n“I love the moment when we switch on the lights for the first time. Its magical the way the tree lights up the room and creates a warm glow, making me feel that the festival has begun. The tree becomes center of our celebrations especially when all my cousins visited us”, she said.\nSamuel Gill, another young member of the community, expressed his enthusiasm, saying, “The Christmas tree is the heart of our holiday celebrations. It’s more than just a decoration—it’s a symbol of joy, hope, and cherished family traditions.”\n“We all enjoy decorating Christmas tree with beautiful ornaments the process in which kids take part enthusiastically”, he said.\nThe season also brings a wave of activity for local businesses. Decorative items, sweet treats, and gifts fly off the shelves as families prepare for the celebrations. Ali Nawaz, a decorative items seller at Karachi Company, noted a steady demand for fairy lights, candles, and small ornaments. “The Christmas season is always special, and people go all out to make their homes festive and welcoming,” he said while talking to APP.\nThe tradition of decorating Christmas trees traces back to 15th-century Livonia (modern-day Estonia and Latvia), where the custom first began. Over centuries, it has evolved into a universal symbol of Christmas, transcending cultural and geographical boundaries.\nAs the joyous occasion approaches, the Christian community in the federal capital is in the final stages of preparations, with the echo of church bells announcing the birth of Jesus Christ.\nThe festival will be marked by a variety of activities, including carol singing, gift exchanges, cake-cutting ceremonies, and small gatherings in homes and churches.\nThe celebration of Christmas is not only a cultural event but also a time to spread love and joy.\nThe illuminated Christmas trees, the melodious carols, and the exchange of heartfelt gifts embody the true spirit of the season—fostering unity, peace, and goodwill.\nAs the evergreen conifer stands tall in homes and public spaces, it serves as a beacon of hope, reminding everyone of the enduring message of Christmas: love, compassion, and the importance of cherishing moments with loved ones.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
