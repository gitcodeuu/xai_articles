  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 23 (APP):The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) unveiled a compelling short documentary, Haven in the Hills: Islamabad’s Wildlife Ark, at a special outdoor screening held at its Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre on Monday.\nThe 12-minute film, produced by filmmaker Ali Ijaz, highlights the centre’s tireless efforts to save endangered species, including common leopards and pangolins.\nThe event, attended by families, schoolchildren, and media personnel, offered a unique glimpse into the IWMB’s critical work, combining an engaging guided tour of the facility with the premiere of the documentary.\nRina Saeed Khan, Chairperson of the IWMB, shared the organisation’s journey during her address. “This initiative began four years ago as a labour of love to rescue animals—some injured, some saved from poachers, and others taken off the streets. Our mission is to treat and return them to the wild. For animals like former ‘dancing bears’ that cannot be released, it is our duty to provide them with a sanctuary.”\nKhan further revealed plans to convert parts of the 28-acre rescue facility into a permanent sanctuary for species such as black bears and leopards.\nShe also hinted at the future establishment of an educational Margalla Wildlife Centre to foster awareness and conservation efforts.\nThe Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, housed at the site of the former Islamabad Zoo, has been operational since the zoo’s closure in 2020 following a landmark decision by the Islamabad High Court.\nUnder the IWMB’s stewardship, the centre has rescued around 400 animals and birds over the past four years, including black bears, leopards, pangolins, freshwater turtles, and various birds of prey.\nMany of these animals have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into their natural habitats.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
