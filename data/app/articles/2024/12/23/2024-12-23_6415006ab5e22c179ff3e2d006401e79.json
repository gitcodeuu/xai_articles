  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 23 (APP):Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, chaired by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, on Monday convened a session at Parliament House to deliberate on critical issues, including the UAE’s unofficial visa restrictions, housing projects, and the welfare of overseas Pakistanis.\nSenator Zeeshan Khanzada emphasized the urgency of addressing lingering visa concerns, noting public frustration over unresolved issues.\n‘People are questioning when these matters will be resolved,’ he remarked, urging clarity on the underlying challenges, said a press release.\nKhanzada pointed out discrepancies in visa processing despite applicants fulfilling all requirements and stressed the importance of keeping the public informed through compliance updates and timelines.\nThe Secretary of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (OPHRD) clarified that the restrictions were not absolute, particularly in Dubai, where skilled labor remains unaffected.\nHe acknowledged a recent decline in the demand for unskilled labor and highlighted the need to prioritize skilled workforce migration. He added that approximately 700,000 workers have been sent abroad this year.\nSenator Khanzada recommended inviting Overseas Employment Promoters (OEPs) to the next meeting for a detailed review of market demand and data accuracy.\nOn housing projects, the Director General of Housing, Overseas Pakistan Foundation (OPF), reported that the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) has completed 95% of the work on a delayed project, initially set for completion in 2008. However, he said that litigation and unresolved liabilities have hindered progress.\nSenator Khanzada urged swift resolution of these issues, suggesting FWO clear its dues and involve IESCO for necessary connections. He emphasized setting a two-month deadline to provide overseas Pakistanis with functional housing.\nCommittee members discussed establishing dedicated immigration counters at international airports for Overseas Pakistanis.\nSenator Nasir Mehmood underscored the importance of maintaining these counters, especially for departing passengers.\nIn addressing welfare services,  Khanzada highlighted the plight of individuals whose passports had been confiscated, preventing their return to Pakistan. He called for urgent measures to facilitate their repatriation, particularly for those released from jail.\nThe disparity in the service structure between OPF college employees and OPF Head Office staff was also brought to light, with the committee resolving to revisit the issue in a follow-up meeting.\nThe session was attended by Senators Shahadat Awan, Gurdeep Singh, Nasir Mehmood, the Secretary of OPHRD, and senior officials from OPF and other relevant departments.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
