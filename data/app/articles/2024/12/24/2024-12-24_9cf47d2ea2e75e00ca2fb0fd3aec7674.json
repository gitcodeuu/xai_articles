  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 24 (APP): The National Assembly Standing Committee on Maritime Affairs met at Parliament House here Tuesday to address pressing challenges facing the maritime sector.\nChaired by MNA Abdul Qadir Patel, the Committee expressed concern over the vacant positions of Chairmen for the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC).\nThe Committee raised serious concerns about the absence of chairpersons for KPT and PNSC, describing the issue as detrimental to the growth and efficiency of these vital organizations.\nThe members emphasized the importance of these roles in strengthening Pakistan’s shipping and port operations.\nThe Committee requested the Minister for Maritime Affairs, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh to expedite the process by presenting the matter to the federal cabinet.\nIt further recommended that these appointments be prioritized, with the recommendations being forwarded to the Prime Minister for consideration.\nAddressing another agenda item, the Committee reviewed PNSC’s plans to acquire new vessels.\nOfficials informed the members that the current fleet was aging and failed to meet forthcoming international regulatory standards.\nThe compliance timeline is estimated at six years, during which operational costs for non-compliant vessels are expected to rise significantly due to de-carbonization requirements.\nIn light of these challenges, PNSC has opted to procure newly built vessels instead of second-hand ships, citing restrictions imposed by Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules.\nHowever, concerns were raised regarding alleged loopholes and potential malafide intentions in the restructuring process of PNSC, including the dismissal of certain officers.\nThe Committee sought detailed explanations from PNSC, which will be reviewed in the next meeting.\nThe meeting was attended by Minister for Maritime Affairs Qaisar Ahmed Sheikh, alongside its members Syed Shah Ahad Ali Shah, Muhammad Ashraf Sahi, Kesoo Mal Kheal Das, Syed Rafiullah, Pulleen, Khurram Munawar Manj, Mian Ghous Muhammad, Sardar Nabil Ahmed Gabol, and Isphanyar M. Bandara. Senior officials from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and related departments were also present on the occasion.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
