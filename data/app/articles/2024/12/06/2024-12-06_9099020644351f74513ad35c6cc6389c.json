Having successfully captured the objective and defended it against successive assaults, Major Shabbir Sharif Shaheed embraced martyrdom when struck by an Indian tank round.\nMajor Shabbir Sharif Shaheed’s extraordinary courage, unwavering dedication, and supreme sacrifice epitomize the highest ideals of patriotism and military excellence.\nHe etched his legacy in history with his blood, defending the motherland against overwhelming odds.\nAs a grateful nation, we honor our gallant heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Their indomitable spirit continues to inspire generations, and their memory remains eternally enshrined in the annals of our history.",
