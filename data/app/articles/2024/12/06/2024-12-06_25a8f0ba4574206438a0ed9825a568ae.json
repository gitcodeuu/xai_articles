KIIR is recognised as a key source of research-based publications for the relevant Government departments and think-tanks.\nWani highlighted that the primary focus of KIIR is to advocate for conflict resolution through strategic dialogues. The Institute actively engages in outreach and networking efforts while promoting international human rights advocacy in Geneva.\nAdditionally, KIIR has established an extensive outreach and internship program designed to engage and empower the next generation of Kashmiri leaders in different domains.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood emphasized the importance of institutional collaboration, and welcomed the signing of the MoU between ISSI and KIIR.\nHe noted that while the two Institutions have worked closely in the past, there is a need to further build on and upscale mutual collaboration.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood highlighted the critical importance of continuous evaluation of the developments in the Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), documenting human rights violations in the occupied territory, and further strengthening advocacy efforts with logic and evidence.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood underscored that peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains a high priority for Pakistan’s foreign policy.\nHe called for pooling of resources and engaging Universities and civil society organizations to enhance awareness, especially among NextGen on this national cause.\nHe emphasised that it is important to convey that “This issue is not about territory. It is fundamentally about the inalienable right to self-determination.
