It explored the evolving role of middle powers and the Global South in the current international order.\nDr Moeed Yusuf, Vice Chancellor, Beaconhouse National University underscored a pivotal shift in the global world order and asserted that the erosion of traditional unipolar world order is paving way for a multi-polar framework where the roles of middle powers and the Global South is increasingly prominent.\nHe defined middle powers as crucial players that cannot be overlooked; these nations refuse to engage in bloc politics and are determined to maintain their independence without aligning with any particular side. He emphasized that the most successful middle powers are those that embrace multi-alignment, deftly navigating complex international dynamics without resorting to binary choices. He recommended Pakistan must focus on geo-economics.\nProf Dr Arshi Saleem Hashmi, Dean Faculty of Contemporary Studies, NDU rejected the notion of the Global South as a monolithic bloc, instead it as a diverse coalition of countries that prioritize strategic neutrality over rigid alliances. Global South should not merely be viewed as an underdeveloped or struggling region; it encompasses emerging economies and rising powers that are gaining influence on the world stage.\nThe focus on South-South cooperation is increasingly overshadowing the traditional North-South divide. She also dismissed the assumption that China or India are leaders of Global South. She concluded that Global South has long way to go and faces numerous political and developmental obstacles.\nDr Niu Haibin, Director of Institute for Foreign Policy, Shanghai Institute for International Studies highlighted that there is neither a clear definable feature of middle powers nor an understanding of who are the members or leaders of Global South.\nThis is an abstract concept but it is important in present world due to changing global context, transforming world order and rising and emerging powers. The global disorder and conflicts have created new space for countries who seek anti-protectionist and pro-inclusive policies.  He concluded that BRICS enlargement is first way to pave the way to an inclusive world for Global South.\nDr Ali Awadh Asseri, former Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Pakistan defined middle powers as having unique attributes and strengths, and aim to practice pragmatic diplomacy and a bridge builder with a focus on cooperation over confrontation. Shifting global dynamics has led to middle powers and Global South in limelight.\nHe believed Saudi Arabia has a greater role to play in Middle East to ensure stability. Terrorism and humanitarian crisis are the major challenges. He stressed that the new world order will be shaped significantly by these rising and emerging middle powers, which advocate for a more inclusive global community rather than exclusive groupings.\nAmbassador Dr Major General Raza Muhammad (Retd.), President IPRI discussed challenges and opportunities for Pakistan as a prominent country of Global South. He stated that overwhelming support for temporary membership at UNSC is an example of Pakistan’s diplomatic prowess.\nFor future, he stated middle powers will, however, have to walk a tightrope to manage the U.S.-China competition. He opined that peace within and peace within the neighborhood would enhance Pakistan’s ability to navigate serious economic and political challenges. He recommended economic interdependence and development as Pakistan’s way forward given ample land, youth, human resources, strategic location and connectivity.\nThe speakers identified five critical responsibilities for middle powers: managing U.S.-China rivalry with responsibility; seeking greater common ground among nations; promoting peaceful coexistence; forming issue-based alliances; and fostering economic interdependence.\nThese responsibilities will be vital for navigating the complexities of the evolving international order and ensuring a balanced approach to global governance. The session followed a rigorous question and answer session, and was attended by diplomats, academics, researchers, students and media personnel.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
