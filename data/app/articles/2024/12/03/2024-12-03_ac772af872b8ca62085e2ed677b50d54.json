Similarly, applicants under the sponsorship scheme have also been approved without the need for a draw.\nAddressing the challenges faced by residents of remote areas in submitting their applications, the minister announced a seven-day extension for Hajj application submissions. Applicants under the Government Hajj Scheme can now submit their forms at designated banks until December 10, 2024.\nChaudhry Salik Hussain further clarified that if applications exceed the allocated quota, a ballot will be conducted to ensure fairness. Overseas Pakistanis are required to deposit their sponsorship funds by December 10 to confirm their participation.\nTo streamline the process, the Ministry has introduced an online portal accessible via its official website, allowing applicants to submit their Hajj forms from home. Additionally, pilgrims are advised to download the ‘Pak Hajj’ mobile app for the latest updates and guidance.\nThis move will help simplify the application process and ensure maximum convenience for aspiring pilgrims.",
