He said that the Constitution obliges the state to provide free and quality education to all citizens.\nHowever, he said that 25 million children in the country are still deprived of education.\nHafiz Naeem emphasized on implementing a uniform curriculum and education system. He stressed the need of implementing the economic system of Islam in the country as the interest-based capitalist system deprives people of equal opportunities and concentrates wealth in a few hands.\nHe reaffirmed Jamaat-e-Islami’s commitment to strive for an Islamic economic system in line with the spirit of the Constitution of Pakistan.\nHafiz Naeem emphasized implementation of Urdu as the national and official language as mandated by the Constitution and upheld by the Supreme Court, calling for all government correspondence, education, and judicial proceedings to be conducted in Urdu.",
