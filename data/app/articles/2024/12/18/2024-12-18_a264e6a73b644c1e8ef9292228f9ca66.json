  "content": "CAIRO, Dec 18 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Wednesday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the Developing Eight (D-8) Charter, aims, objectives and intra-regional cooperation.\nIn a statement at the 21st Meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of D-8 countries, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister said that Pakistan was committed to increasing economic collaboration and boosting trade within the D-8.\nHe highlighted the potential for economic collaboration and trade within the D-8 economies, specifically in the areas of agriculture, food security and tourism.\nHe termed the signing of the Protocol on the D-8 PTA Dispute Settlement Mechanism as a key achievement for resolving trade disputes and promoting intra-regional trade.\nHe informed that the federal cabinet had approved the protocol on dispute resolution mechanism (DSM) of D-8 PTA. The cabinet had also approved its operationalization and they hoped to ratify it very soon.\nThe DPM said “Agriculture and food security are critical priorities for Pakistan and the D-8. In March 2023, we inaugurated the D-8 Research Center on Agriculture and Food Security in Pakistan.”\nHe hoped that the center would serve as a hub for innovative research that would benefit all member states.\nReferring to tourism sector, Dar said that it was another area with immense potential. In August 2023, Pakistan hosted the 3rd Meeting in Islamabad, which resulted in the Islamabad Declaration on Tourism.\n“This outlines clear commitments to implementing the D-8 comprehensive strategy on tourism,” he added.\nThe DPM/FM said the situation in Gaza had worsened, with devastating loss of life and injuries to innocent civilians.\nThe continued escalation of violence, including in Lebanon and Syria, was deeply concerning, he said, adding  “Pakistan calls for an immediate and unconditional end to the hostilities. The D-8 Council of Minister provides an important forum to discuss ways to respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Middle East.”\nDar further said for the D-8 to grow and thrive; it was vital to welcome new members and expressed Pakistan’s support to Azerbaijan’s application for membership.\nHe also hoped that the criteria for the membership would be approved by the member states to welcome new members.\nDPM/FM Dar put forward the nomination of D-8 Secretary General from Pakistan, Ambassador Sohail Mehmood, for the term starting from 1st January 2026.\nThe deputy prime minister/foreign minister welcomed Egypt as the new chair of the D-8 and said that they looked forward to working together to promote growth and prosperity.\nHe also appreciated the outstanding contributions of the D-8 Secretariat, in driving progress and fostering collaboration among member states.",
