  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 18 (APP):National Assembly on Wednesday passed the National Forensic Agency Bill, 2024, after a clause-by-clause review.\nThe bill was tabled by Federal Minister for Interior Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi in the house.\nThe bill had already been approved by the Senate.\nThe legislation aims to transform the National Forensics Agency (NFA) project into a fully independent agency to enhance forensic capabilities nationwide.\nFederal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar detailed the bill’s significance, saying that the NFA would integrate existing conventional forensic labs and establish a state-of-the-art digital forensic lab.\nThese services would be extended to all provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and government or private forensic labs.\nHe said that creating an independent NFA is critical to overcoming challenges associated with the current fragmented forensic system, which leads to inconsistent standards and capabilities across the country.\nThe minister highlighted that Pakistan’s only forensic laboratory, located in Lahore, was established in 2011-12 by the current Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif.\nHe pointed out that the lab is now overburdened and stressed the urgent need for all provincial governments to establish their forensic labs.\nThe establishment of a modern forensic laboratory, he added, is essential for combating crime and ensuring justice through advanced investigative tools.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
