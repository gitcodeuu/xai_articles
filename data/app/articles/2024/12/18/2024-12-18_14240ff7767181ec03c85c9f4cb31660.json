Al-Shifa Trust has prioritized the commencement of its operations, recognizing the urgent need for quality eye care in the area despite its scheduled completion in 2026.\nThe newly inaugurated facility has already started offering Outpatient Department services and eye surgeries, with fully trained and highly skilled doctors and support teams now on the ground.\nAll services will be free to the community, reinforcing the trust’s commitment to eradicating preventable blindness and improving access to specialized eye care in underserved regions like Gilgit-Baltistan.\nAbdul Rehman Mithani, advisor to Rupani Development Initiatives, illuminated the Rupani Foundation’s evolution, goals, and ongoing projects at the ceremony. He stated that the foundation focuses on improving people’s lives through quality education, community development, and superior healthcare facilities.\nMithani emphasized that the Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital is a remarkable gift for the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, offering free treatments, medicines, and surgeries.\nMinisters, senior government officials, and other dignitaries also attended the inaugural event and commended Al-Shifa Trust for its visionary approach and timely action in addressing healthcare gaps.\nAfter completion, the facility will be the region’s first. It will offer advanced medical care and ensure that the people of Gilgit-Baltistan receive world-class eye treatment close to home.\nParticipants said that enhancing healthcare access in remote areas was a noble cause and this initiative aimed to revolutionize healthcare delivery by offering cutting-edge medical services to underprivileged communities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
