The IWMB has focused on educating the public about responsible behaviour in the national park, promoting a sense of ownership among visitors.\nAbdul Samad described his hiking experiences as both memorable and exciting. He emphasized that the trail is excellent for enhancing trekking skills and improving physical health.\n“While hiking may not lead to significant weight loss, it strengthens limbs and joints through the physical exertion required to navigate the terrain,” he explained. The challenge of walking uphill not only provides a workout but also fosters a deeper connection with the natural surroundings.\nOfficials from the IWMB have been proactive in monitoring the park. They maintain a vigilant patrolling staff that takes strict action against littering. Their efforts to promote zero plastic use in the national park have been met with positive responses from visitors.\nBy raising awareness about the importance of keeping the environment clean, the IWMB aims to preserve the beauty of Margalla Hills for current and future generations.\nVisitors to Trail 5 are increasingly practising responsible hiking, showing respect for nature while enjoying their time outdoors. The improvement in cleanliness has made the trail more enjoyable for everyone. As the popularity of Trail 5 continues to rise, it serves as a reminder of the essential role that nature plays in our lives.\nThe trail not only provides physical benefits but also promotes mental well-being, making it a vital escape for those looking to unwind.
