  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 20 (APP):Chairman Senate Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani proposed a practical solution to address the issue of ministers’ absenteeism in the House, recalling his tenure as Prime Minister.\nSpeaking at the Speaker’s Conference in response to a question about ministers’ absence, Gilani said, “When I was Prime Minister, similar complaints were raised about ministers not attending sessions. To resolve this, I decided to personally attend the House sessions regularly. Once I started doing so, not only did the ministers ensure their presence, but the attendance of ruling party members and ministry officials also improved significantly.”\nHe suggested adopting a similar approach today, emphasizing that leadership by example can effectively enhance participation and accountability in parliamentary proceedings.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
