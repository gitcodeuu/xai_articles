Many Palestinian students have already arrived in Pakistan under this program and are pursuing full-degree programs, while efforts are underway to bring more students to Pakistan.\nDuring the meeting, Prof. Dr. M.Iqbal Choudhary highlighted the severe educational crisis caused by recent Israeli aggression, which has not only resulted in the loss of lives and livelihoods but has also disrupted education for Palestinian youth for years.\nHe stated, “We will not abandon our Palestinian students. COMSTECH is committed to utilizing all available resources to provide them with free, quality education at Pakistan’s top universities.”\nHe also announced COMSTECH’s plan to host an extraordinary conference of OIC Member States’ Ministers of Education to address Palestine’s educational crisis. The conference will focus on practical measures to support young Palestinian students.\nAmbassador Dr. Zaheer Mohammad Hamdallah Zaid expressed his gratitude for COMSTECH’s initiative of offering 5,000 scholarships, describing it as a significant “practical assistance.”\nHe appreciated Pakistan and COMSTECH’s steadfast support for the Palestinian cause and their efforts to address the educational challenges faced by Palestinian students.\nThe ambassador assured full cooperation from the Palestinian Embassy to facilitate the process of bringing more Palestinian students to Pakistan through COMSTECH’s platform.\nHe also announced plans to visit various Pakistani universities under COMSTECH’s platform to explore further avenues for collaboration in the education sector. Additionally, he emphasized streamlining and expediting the scholarship selection process.\nThis meeting marks a significant step in strengthening educational ties between Pakistan and Palestine, with both sides committed to supporting Palestinian students during challenging times. The officials from both sides were also presented in the meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
