Like other segments of society, transgender community members are also getting drug addicted at a fast pace, Farzana warned.\nDue to psychological stress, being disowned by family members, societal mistreatment, poverty and deprivation, the community members are inclined towards drug addiction, Farzana explained.\nShe also requested for ensuring the provision of necessary facilities to transgender during treatment while keeping in view the behavioural response of people with them.\nShe said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had recently announced the reservation of a separate room for the transgender community at every district headquarters hospital to encourage them to benefit from the government’s supported public health schemes.\nSimilarly, in rehabilitation services, the privacy of transgender should also be confirmed to ensure availing of the service with peace of mind, she went on to say.",
