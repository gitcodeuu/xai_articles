He inspired a nation to unite and strive for independence while embodying the values of unity, faith, and discipline that continue to guide us today,” she said.\nJinnah’s vision extended beyond the establishment of a separate nation, aiming to create a society rooted in justice, equity, and opportunity. “He envisioned Pakistan as a democratic state governed by the rule of law and human rights, where Muslims could live according to Islamic principles and people of all faiths could coexist peacefully,” Dr. Najeeba added.\nReflecting on his remarkable character, she described Jinnah as a leader of unwavering principles, intellectual brilliance, and profound determination. His commitment to education, social justice, and economic equality remains a cornerstone of the national ethos.\nDr. Najeeba also drew attention to the historical and enduring relationship between Pakistan and Turkey, underscoring their shared values and mutual respect. She recalled Quaid-e-Azam’s address on March 4, 1948, during the presentation of credentials by the first Turkish ambassador to Pakistan, where he expressed admiration for Turkey’s struggle and reaffirmed the bond between the two nations.\nQuoting Jinnah, she said, “The Muslims of Pakistan entertain sentiments of affection and esteem for Turkey. As free, sovereign, and independent countries, we can strengthen our ties for the good of both nations and contribute to global peace and prosperity.”\nShe lauded the Turkish Embassy’s initiatives, including cultural exchanges, educational collaborations, and economic partnerships, as examples of this deep-rooted friendship. She acknowledged Ambassador Irfan Neziroglu’s efforts to enhance bilateral relations as a testament to Turkey’s commitment to fostering strong ties with Pakistan.\nDr. Najeeba concluded by urging citizens to draw inspiration from Quaid-e-Azam’s vision and work collectively toward a prosperous and inclusive future for Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
