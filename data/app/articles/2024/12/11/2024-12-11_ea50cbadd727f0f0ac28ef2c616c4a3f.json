  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP): The Administrator of the Human Organ Transplant Authority (HOTA) has stopped Max Health Hospital from kidney transplantation over failing to comply with the regulations governing organ transplantation.\nThe Administrator has suspended all kidney transplant procedures at Max Health Hospital due to the hospital’s lack of adherence to the rules regarding the formation of Evaluation Committee.\nThis suspension is deemed a serious violation of the HOTA Act of 2010, which clearly outlines the necessity of such committees to oversee transplant activities.\nAccording to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, this suspension will remain effective until further notice.\nThe HOTA Administrator had previously directed all 20 hospitals in Islamabad to establish Evaluation Committees by November 30.\nMax Health Hospital’s non-compliance with this directive has prompted immediate action to safeguard patient welfare and uphold medical integrity.\nIn accordance with the Ministry of Health’s directives, the HOTA Administrator has initiated the formation of an inquiry committee to investigate irregularities within the transplantation process.\nThis committee is tasked with examining the reported discrepancies and compile a detailed report along with recommendations by December 13.\nThe findings will serve as the basis for strict disciplinary measures against those found culpable.",
