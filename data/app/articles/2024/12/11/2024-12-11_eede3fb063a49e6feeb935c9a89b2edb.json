He emphasized the need for legal action against those who incite and mobilize individuals for such activities, only to abandon them while fleeing across multiple districts.\nHe also condemned the unlawful protests that violated High Court orders, describing them as attempts to release a jailed individual.\nAmir Muqam affirmed that issues concerning Pashtuns have been raised in the federal cabinet and other relevant forums. He assured that investigations would be conducted based on concrete evidence rather than unsubstantiated allegations, ensuring fairness and transparency throughout the process.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
