  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):In observance of the United Nations Human Rights Day, the World Kashmir Awareness Forum (WKAF) highlighted the 77-year-long human rights crisis in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nTo raise awareness, WKAF rented digital advertising trucks in New York City, displaying messages about the dire situation in Kashmir, received a press release here on Wednesday.\nThe trucks carried slogans such as: “Indian Atrocities at its Peak: Kashmiris Want World to Speak”, “Election in Kashmir is Ruse: India Committing Human Rights Abuse”, “Indian Forces on Killing Spree: Kashmir Needs to be Set Free”\n“Kashmiris Reject Indian Occupation: UN Resolution Only Solution”, and “Indian Brutality in Kashmir Galore: World Community Cannot Ignore”.\nThese digital ads circulated key locations, including the United Nations headquarters, the Indian Mission, Freedom Tower, Times Square, and various UN missions, from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\nDr. Ghulam N. Mir, President of WKAF and Chairman of the Kashmir Diaspora Coalition, stressed the significance of Human Rights Day as a UN initiative established in 1948. He lamented the UN’s failure to safeguard the rights of indigenous people, particularly in Kashmir and Palestine. “The world is drifting towards the total dehumanization of these oppressed people, with no signs of relief in sight,” he said.\nDr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, Chairman of the World Forum for Peace & Justice, underscored that self-determination is a cornerstone of international peace. He cited examples like Namibia, East Timor, and Kosovo, where oppressive rule was overturned through international law. “Kashmiris are facing an existential crisis, yet the international community turns a blind eye due to India’s regional dominance,” he warned.\nProfessor (Dr.) Imtiaz Khan, a Kashmiri-American scholar, reminded the world that the ongoing crisis in Kashmir serves as a glaring example of the global failure to uphold human rights. He urged the international community to amplify the voices of Kashmiri civilians and human rights defenders.\nRaja Mukhtar, senior leader of the JKLF North America, called for the release of political prisoners, including Mohammad Yasin Malik, who is languishing in New Delhi’s notorious Tihar Jail.\nAdvocate Sardar Imtiaz Khan Garalvi stressed that the unresolved Kashmir conflict is a threat to global peace and urged the UN to take decisive action to uphold its mission of ensuring justice and stability.\nSardar Taj Khan, Vice Chairman of the Kashmir Mission USA, highlighted the daily violations of Kashmiris’ basic rights. “Their right to life is violated every day through wanton killings. The international community cannot remain silent,” he said.\nSardar Sawar Khan, former Advisor to the Prime Minister of Azad Kashmir, condemned the global silence on the issue. “India’s unchecked atrocities in Kashmir must be met with sanctions and censure,” he demanded.\nSardar Zarif Khan, Advisor to the President of Azad Kashmir, called for an impartial plebiscite in Kashmir under UN supervision. He also criticized the spread of RSS extremism, which poses a threat to minorities across India, including Christians, Sikhs, and Dalits.\nSardar Shoaib Irshad, General Secretary of the Kashmir American Welfare Association (KAWA), warned of the catastrophic consequences of a third war over Kashmir. “The region has already sparked two wars between India and Pakistan. The deplorable situation in Kashmir cannot be ignored any longer,” he stated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
