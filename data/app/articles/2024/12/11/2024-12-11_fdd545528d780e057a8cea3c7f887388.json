Hundreds of students and tourists both local and foreign, visit the facility each day.\n“I have seen the white peacock here for the first time and I am loving it,” said Farhan Ahmed, an intermediate student who traveled over 500 kilometers from Multan to see the aviary.\n“I have a special liking for birds; I read about them in books and see them on social media but it is amazing to see them here physically.”\nThe aviary features a wide variety of birds including peacocks, cranes, pelicans, ducks, parrots, cockatoos, emus, ostriches and pigeons.\nMost of these birds have been imported from countries such as Brazil, Australia, Malaysia and various parts of the Americas.\nZubair Ahmed, the aviary in-charge explained, “We have around twenty percent local and eighty percent imported birds.\nThey are all provided with food, water and shelter.” The birds roam freely in a safe environment and visitors are encouraged to interact with them including feeding them.\nThe aviary’s design incorporates hundreds of trees, ponds, nests and incubation areas creating a natural habitat for most of the birds.\nSome birds are housed in specially designed cages and cabins that allow for closer interaction with visitors. “The good thing is they have planted fruit trees here and the birds can pluck them for food” noted Imran, a visitor.\nFor those interested in bringing their pets, the aviary has a tame birds section where visitors can bring their own birds.\nAround 50 trained staff members are present at the facility to assist visitors and ensure the well-being of the birds.\nA well-equipped hatchery on-site supports artificial incubation in a controlled environment, aiding in the breeding process.\nAdditionally, a state-of-the-art hospital is available for new birds, allowing for proper quarantine measures.\nAli, a staff member explained the quarantine process: “We quarantine new birds for seven to fourteen days in the hospital, vaccinate and treat them before releasing them into the aviary.” This careful approach ensures the health and safety of all birds within the aviary.\nIn addition to birdwatching, the aviary offers pony rides for children’s entertainment. Trained instructors work with the management to tame and train the ponies, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for young visitors. “It is a tough job to tame and train the horses and take care of all the birds round the clock,” Ali said. “But we are doing it for the pleasure of our visitors.”\nThe aviary not only serves as a sanctuary for birds but also as an educational hub where visitors can learn about wildlife conservation and the importance of protecting various species.\nThe combination of entertainment and education makes it an ideal destination for families, students and nature enthusiasts alike.\nAs the aviary continues to attract visitors, it plays a crucial role in promoting awareness about avian species and biodiversity.\nWith its impressive collection and commitment to education, the aviary in Islamabad stands out as a unique experience for all who visit.\nWhether feeding the birds or enjoying a pony ride, guests leave with lasting memories and a deeper appreciation for nature.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
