Young people will be at the forefront in promoting Pakistan’s soft image.”\nHe further mentioned that the Prime Minister’s Youth Program is working with universities to advance the Green Pakistan initiative, adding that tourism flourishes in stable environments.\nRana Mashhood also raised concerns about the effects of misinformation, saying, “When minds are polluted, the outcomes are never positive. Without secure borders, stability is unattainable.”\nHe criticized those spreading negativity and called on the youth to decide whether they wish to contribute to Pakistan’s prosperity or fall victim to propaganda.\nHighlighting new initiatives, he announced the introduction of the National Youth Policy and Employment Program for the first time. He noted that Pakistan is combating issues such as the IMF’s policies and fake news while attracting billions of dollars in investment after years of stagnation.\nThe event concluded with a call to action for youth to play an active role in ensuring the nation’s sustainable development and stability.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
