This agreement, once formalized, would enable Pakistani prisoners to complete their sentences in Pakistan, reflecting the strong and cooperative ties between the two nations.\nSenator Azam Nazeer Tarar highlighted Pakistan’s dedication to fast-tracking this agreement in close coordination with Malaysian authorities, including the Deputy Prime Minister.\nThese efforts are consistent with Pakistan’s National Emigration and Welfare Policy, which underscores the protection and welfare of overseas Pakistanis. The government remains committed to safeguarding the rights of its diaspora, including undocumented workers and prisoners abroad.\nThe Malaysian delegation reiterated their commitment to resolving challenges such as limited legal aid and communication barriers for prisoners. Both sides acknowledged the need for enhanced support mechanisms to ensure the welfare of incarcerated individuals.\nThe Ministry of Human Rights, along with the National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR), in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, has outlined measures to improve consular support for Pakistani prisoners in Malaysia. These include providing legal representation, translation services, and advocating for fair legal procedures.\nThis initiative underscores the government’s dedication to upholding human rights and strengthening bilateral ties to ensure the dignity and welfare of its citizens.",
