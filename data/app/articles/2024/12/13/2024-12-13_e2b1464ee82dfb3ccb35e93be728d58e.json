The importance of this initiative was further emphasized during the Fourth Belt and Road Construction Work Symposium earlier this month.\nThe green and low-carbon expert network is both an innovative mechanism for enhancing international exchanges in emerging fields, and one of China’s key measures under the “Promoting Green Development” action within the eight initiatives supporting the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative.\n“Looking ahead, we are full of expectations for building a Green Silk Road,” noted Zhao Yingmin, Vice Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment.\nHe outlined three key priorities including fostering consensus, innovating cooperation paths and promoting pragmatic cooperation. Supported by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Green Alliance serves as the secretariat for GLEN.\nExperts participating in the dialogue represent various fields, including climate, energy, environment, finance, and international cooperation. They unanimously agreed that the GLEN platform allows cross-sector sharing of research outcomes and establishes cooperative mechanisms.\nThese efforts support partner countries and regions in improving top-level designs and standard systems for green and low-carbon development. Moreover, GLEN offers decision-making advice, theoretical research, project evaluation, and capacity-building support for enterprises, financial institutions, and other stakeholders involved in Belt and Road green international cooperation projects.\nRui Wanjie, CEO of Rui Na Xin International Consulting, emphasized the importance of the six key tasks proposed by GLEN for advancing the green and low-carbon transitions of partner countries. For African nations, she highlighted that future China-Africa cooperation should prioritize the development of green infrastructure and related projects in manufacturing, environment, and commodities to promote ecological civilization on the continent.\nGuo Jing, Chair of the Green Development International Alliance (Green Alliance), highlighted the significant achievements in 2024 across policy research, international communication, and conference organization.\nThroughout the year, the Green Alliance and its domestic and international partners conducted joint studies on key areas of the Green Belt and Road, including green energy, green finance, and climate financing.\nReports such as the Belt and Road Green Development Outlook, China’s Actions on South-South Cooperation in Addressing Climate Change, and Cooperation on Low-Carbon Energy Transition between China and Key Belt and Road Countries were officially released during the conference. These reports, as milestones in building an international think tank platform for Green Belt and Road development, systematically showcased progress, shared China’s green development practices, it also served as a valuable reference for identifying opportunities and challenges in building a Green Belt and Road and advancing international cooperation in ecological and climate-related fields along the Belt and Road.\nZhang Jieqing, Chief Representative of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Beijing Office, stated that four institutions from China, Indonesia, and the Philippines jointly completed the report titled “Cooperation on Low-Carbon Energy Transition between China and Key Belt and Road Countries.”\nFabby Tumiwa, Executive Director of Indonesia’s Institute for Essential Services Reform, emphasized that in the process of low-carbon development, countries need to strengthen cooperation rather than act individually, as only through joint efforts can the challenges be addressed.\nBy signing the Memorandum of Cooperation, the Green Alliance and Indonesia’s Institute for Essential Services Reform will work together within the framework of the Green Development Investment and Financing Partnership (GIFP) to deepen China-Indonesia and China-ASEAN green and low-carbon cooperation, promoting energy low-carbon transitions and green transportation development. Additionally, the Green Alliance will collaborate with the Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency, focusing on mutual recognition of carbon footprint rules and capacity building. It will also cooperate with the China Quality Certification Center on the development of carbon footprint platforms and rules, jointly advancing innovation and development of the Belt and Road carbon management system.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
