  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 13 (APP): Zong 4G, Pakistan’s leading telecom operator, continues to demonstrate its unwavering commitment to corporate social responsibility by addressing critical healthcare challenges faced by underserved communities.\nZong’s Sustainability Team visited Kotri Jamshoro to observe the operations of a mobile health unit established in collaboration with the Alkhidmat Foundation.\nThis remarkable initiative is aimed at providing free healthcare services to under-served communities in the remote areas of Sindh said a news release issued here on Friday.\nThis initiative offers vital medical assistance, including free consultations and medications, ensuring that basic healthcare reaches those who need it the most.\nThe program has already made a significant difference, positively impacting the lives of over 3,000 individuals who often struggle with limited access to hospitals and the prohibitive costs of medical treatment. Through the deployment of a mobile health unit, Zong has bridged the healthcare gap, delivering essential medical care directly to these communities.\nDuring the visit, Zong’s team interacted with residents who shared heartfelt accounts of how the initiative has significantly improved their lives. From general check-ups for common ailments like fever and body pain to follow-ups for chronic conditions, the mobile health unit has become a lifeline for many in the region.\nAn Alkhidmat Foundation representative highlighted the dire need for healthcare in these areas, stating, “At Alkhidmat Foundation, we believe in breaking barriers to healthcare access, ensuring that no community is left behind. Through our Mobile Health Unit initiative, we’re reaching under-served areas with essential medical services.\nThis partnership with Zong represents a powerful collaboration, uniting technology and humanitarian efforts to create lasting change. Together, we’re not just delivering healthcare — we’re delivering hope.” Said Dr Syed Tabassum Jaffri – President Alkhidmat Foundation Sindh.\nAndleeb Aslam, Dy Director Communications and Sustainability at Zong 4G reinforced the company’s commitment to bridging this gap, remarking, “Access to healthcare is an issue that must be taken seriously. While we can’t help everyone, we try to reach as many as we can through our partnership with Alkhidmat. This initiative is just one step in our journey towards creating a healthier, more equitable future for all.”\nBy addressing the pressing issue of inadequate healthcare access in remote areas of Sindh, this initiative sets the foundation for sustainable improvements in community health and well-being.\nOver time, the program can create a ripple effect by reducing the prevalence of untreated illnesses, enabling individuals to lead healthier lives, and enhancing the productivity of local communities. Moreover, this initiative serves as a model that can be replicated in other under-served regions, amplifying its impact across the province and beyond.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
