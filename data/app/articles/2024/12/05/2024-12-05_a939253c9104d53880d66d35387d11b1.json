This pre-planned coordinated and premeditated propaganda reflects continuity of a sinister design by certain political elements as an attempt to drive a wedge between the public & Armed Forces and institutions of Pakistan.\nThis futile attempt, fueled and abetted by external players, will never be successful, InshAllah,” said an Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) news release.\nChief of Army Staff (COAS), General Syed Asim Munir presided over two days 84th Formation Commanders Conference here at GHQ, attended by Corps Commanders, Principal Staff Officers, and all Formation Commanders of Pakistan Army.\nThe Forum emphasized that it was imperative that Government should promulgate and implement stringent laws and regulations to check unfettered and unethical use of freedom of expression to spew venom, lies and sow the seeds of polarization.\n“Those spreading fake news for vested political and financial interests need to be identified and brought to justice,” the Forum said.\nThe Forum resolved that Army remains committed to serving the nation and public and guard against all external and internal threats without any bias and political affiliation, and any attempt to pitch innocent people against each other and use of violence as an instrument for vested gains could never be tolerated, it further said.\nThe Forum conducted a comprehensive analysis of ongoing counterterrorism operations and resolved to continue neutralizing terrorists, their facilitators, and abettors working at the behest of hostile forces to destabilize Pakistan, with heightened focus on operations against terrorists operating inside Balochistan including BLA Majeed Brigade.\nThe Forum began by offering Fateha and paying solemn tribute to the martyrs of the Armed Forces, Law Enforcement Agencies, and citizens of Pakistan who sacrificed their lives for the nation’s security and sovereignty, including those Law Enforcement Agencies personnel who embraced martyrdom during recent violent protests in Islamabad.\nThe Forum condemned ongoing human rights violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering political, diplomatic, and moral support for the Kashmiri people.
