She stressed the need to address policy gaps, with a particular focus on biodiversity, disaster risk reduction, digital environmental monitoring, green financing, and carbon markets.\nInternational experts from UNEP, including Caroline Kaimuru, GEO Coordination Consultant, and Sandor Frigyik, Programme Management Officer, led training sessions on the methodologies and frameworks required to create an inclusive, participatory environmental report.\nThe workshop, which attracted key stakeholders from various sectors, is part of a broader initiative under the UNEP-led “Capacity Development for Inclusive Policy Interface” project, which aims to strengthen countries’ abilities to use environmental data for science-based planning and decision-making. UNEP is committed to empowering countries, including Pakistan, to address the climate, pollution, and nature crises through enhanced environmental data accessibility.\nDr Khalid Walid, Research Fellow, SDPI, concluded the workshop by emphasizing that the NSoER would serve as a crucial tool in evaluating Pakistan’s environmental progress, guiding policies, and aligning them with international commitments, including the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and future NDCs.\nThe report is expected to help identify key environmental risks, track policy effectiveness, and guide resource allocation to strengthen climate resilience across the country, he said.\nHe added that the Ministry, in partnership with UNEP and SDPI, is committed to ensuring a collaborative approach involving all relevant stakeholders, including provincial governments, sector specialists, and civil society.\n“This report is not just about assessment; it’s about action,” said Sahibzada. “It will inform the necessary investments and policy shifts required to ensure a sustainable and resilient future for Pakistan.”\nThe collaborative efforts outlined in this workshop, signal a proactive step towards ensuring that Pakistan meets its environmental and climate-related obligations while fostering sustainable development in the face of growing climate challenges, he emphasised.",
