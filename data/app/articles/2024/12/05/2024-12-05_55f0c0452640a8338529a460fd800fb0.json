Efforts will be made to balance national security concerns with the need for a robust, secure, and fast Internet environment for businesses and consumers alike.\nAs the government moves forward with its telecom reforms, including the PN licensing process and 5G spectrum auction, all stakeholders will continue to collaborate to safeguard the future of Pakistan’s digital infrastructure.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
