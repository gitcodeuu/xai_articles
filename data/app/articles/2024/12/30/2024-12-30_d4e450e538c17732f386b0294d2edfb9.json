  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 30 (APP): The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has advised consumers to refrain from using gas compressors to increase pressure, terming the practice illegal and hazardous to human lives and public property.\nThe SNGPL spokesperson warned that connections of those found using compressors would be disconnected.\nHighlighting the issue, he said that during winters, some consumers’ use of compressors not only disrupts the gas supply to others but also negatively impacts the overall distribution system.\nHe urged consumers to adopt safe practices, including the use of high-quality gas appliances and routine inspections of equipment and pipelines for leaks, to prevent accidents during the winter season.\nDespite repeated awareness campaigns, he said, negligence during the colder months often leads to unfortunate incidents. He specifically cautioned against using rubber pipes with gas heaters, attributing many past accidents to their misuse.\nEmphasizing the importance of a safety-first approach, the spokesperson called for fostering a culture of responsible gas usage to ensure consumer safety and uninterrupted services.\nHe also urged consumers to avoid excessive gas consumption and educate their families and staff about essential safety protocols.\nHotel and guesthouse owners were advised to display safety instruction cards in rooms, outlining proper guidelines for using gas heaters.\nHe recommended using soapy water, rather than matches, to detect gas leaks and encouraged seeking assistance from certified plumbers for repairs.\nThe spokesperson highlighted the dangers of operating electrical switches or devices during a gas leak, which could ignite accumulated gas.\nIn such cases, he advised consumers to immediately shut off the main gas valve, open windows and doors for ventilation, and avoid using fans or exhaust systems.\nHe stressed the importance of ensuring proper ventilation in rooms with gas heaters and urged consumers to turn off all gas-powered appliances, including stoves, geysers, and heaters, before sleeping.\nFor emergencies, consumers were advised to contact SNGPL’s 24/7 helpline at 1199 or visit the nearest SNGPL office in Rawalpindi.\nHe assured that emergency teams remain on standby at complaint centers to handle critical situations promptly.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
