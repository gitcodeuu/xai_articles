This Council will serve as a central body for policy formulation, implementation, and advocacy for the rights and welfare of PWDs” he added.\nPresident Zardari said that Pakistan recognised the importance of special education and training for PWDs.\nHe said that for this purpose, the country had developed a nationwide network of Special Education Centres and Vocational Training Institutes, catering to the diverse needs of PWDs. These centres are designed to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to become self-reliant and contributing members of society.\nBesides, he said that the implementation of a special quota in government jobs ensured PWDs’ access to meaningful employment opportunities.\n“While significant progress has been made, there remains much work to be done. We need to increase their access to Assistive Technology and public places and create legal, social and economic conditions to ensure their full participation in all sectors, including employment, sports, education and other socio-economic activities, he stressed.\nThe president also emphasised providing an enabling environment for PWDs with quality education, skills, healthcare facilities, employment based on their skills and abilities, and fully implementing job quotas.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
