Strengthened DRCs not only provide timely and cost-effective justice but also play a vital role in reducing the burden on formal courts and fostering social harmony at the grassroots level.\nDRCs established by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police (KP) are pivotal in addressing the challenges of access to justice, particularly for marginalized communities in KP.\nThese councils serve as alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, offering a platform for resolving conflicts efficiently and amicably without resorting to formal court systems.\nStrengthening these councils is crucial for enhancing access to justice as many individuals, especially in rural and marginalized communities, face barriers in accessing formal courts due to high costs, procedural complexities, and geographic constraints.\nAlso, DRCs play an important role in reducing the burden on courts, promoting timely and cost-effective dispute resolution mechanisms as well as playing a critical role in conflict prevention and social cohesion.\nDPO Swat Badshah Hazrat during his keynote address emphasized the critical role of DRCs in promoting peace and justice in local communities. DRCs not only alleviate the burden on formal courts but also provide a culturally sensitive and accessible platform for resolving disputes, he added.\nStrengthening these councils was vital to ensuring equitable access to justice. Safi-Ullah Jan, District & Sessions Judge/Zilla Qazi Swat highlighted that the Dispute Resolution Councils in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were an essential part of the justice system, providing alternative, community-based solutions for resolving disputes efficiently and amicably.\nStrengthening DRCs fosters trust between communities and the justice system, bridging gaps in governance. DRCs involve community members, including elders and respected local figures, to mediate disputes, enhancing local ownership of the justice process.\nDuring the workshop, participants discussed challenges faced by DRCs in delivering justice and maintaining community trust as well as best practices for alternative dispute resolution tailored to the socio-cultural context of Malakand Division.\nThey also presented recommendations for capacity building, inclusivity, and resource mobilization to strengthen DRCs.\nMs. Nida Khan Advocate, PJN Rule of Law Advisor highlighted the importance of gender responsive DRC system in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and making it more inclusive.\nThe workshop outcomes included actionable recommendations to enhance legal and procedural frameworks governing DRCs, increase inclusivity, with a focus on women and other vulnerable communities including transgender, religious minorities and persons with disabilities participation in dispute resolution processes. Participants also recommended providing technical and operational training to DRC members and to improve collaboration between DRCs and formal justice institutions for seamless coordination.\nThe consultative workshop concluded with a collective commitment to advance the proposed action plan and ensure sustained support for DRCs. The initiative aligns with the broader goal of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions in Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
