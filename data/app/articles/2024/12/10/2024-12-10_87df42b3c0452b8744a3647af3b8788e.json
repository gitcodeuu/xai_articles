  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 10 (APP):Minister for Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Tuesday lambasted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for propagating false claims about casualties during the November 26 protests in Islamabad.\nReplying to PTI opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan’s claims in the National Assembly, he challenged PTI to provide proof for 12 alleged deaths. “Show evidence, images of funerals or their CNIC numbers or any other information about the deceased’s families.”\nAsif said that PTI leader Latif Khossa had made exaggerated claims of 278 deaths in a television interview while some claimed 40,50,70 and other numbers of deaths, adding there was a rift among the PTI leadership and were fuelling a flood of lies and baseless allegations.\nHe added that PTI leadership fled from the scene of violent protest on November 26 leaving their supporters behind and now were trying to play the Pashtun card.\nThe minister said that PTI’s call for civil disobedience would be met with the same fate as the founder of PTI did ten years ago by setting utility bills on fire.\nAsif added that Pakistan’s remittance flow and stock exchange index had increased, and the inflation rate decreased while PTI led the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government which had no funds for universities, colleges, hospitals and development was continuously creating anarchy in the country.\nHe said that the PTI govt was ignoring the real tragedy in Kurram, and other areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was using the linguistic and regional cards for their self-interest to derail the path of the prosperity of the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
