  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 19 (APP):National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Thursday emphasized the need for consistent reforms in the parliamentary process, suggesting that “mistakes from the past must be corrected.”\n“If the government gets more time, the opposition is unhappy; if the opposition gets more time, the government is upset,” Sadiq noted, while addressing the inaugural session of 18th Speakers Conference.\nHe stated that managing expectations is the toughest part of his position.\nTerming the event a great honor, he highlighted the complexities of a speaker’s role in balancing the demands of government, opposition, and backbenchers.\nSadiq called for mandatory annual Speakers Conferences and proposed training workshops for universities and colleges to educate students on parliamentary procedures.\nHighlighting the critical role of chief whips, Sadiq said, “They are my eyes and ears.
