  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 13 (APP):The Federal Minister for Law & Justice and Human Rights Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar Wednesday presided over a meeting to review remission policies and address non-bailable offenses under the Narcotics Substances Act, 1997.\nThe meeting included Provincial AIGs of Prisons, the Secretary of Human Rights, and representatives from the Anti-Narcotics Force, said a press release.\nThe primary focus of the meeting was on assessing the potential for granting special remission to specific categories of prisoners, with an emphasis on balancing public welfare, justice, and rehabilitation.\nThe minister underscored the importance of adopting a reformatory approach that ensures effective inmate rehabilitation while safeguarding the rights of victims and maintaining community safety.\nParticipants reviewed proposed remission guidelines to confirm they are fair, just, and adhere to strict eligibility criteria, maintaining a balanced strategy that addresses both rehabilitation needs and victims’ rights.\nThe committee underscored that overcrowding in prisons should not be used as a justification for special remission, noting that indiscriminate practices in the past have led to increase crime rates and further overcrowding. It was recommended that federal and provincial governments exercise their powers judiciously, benefiting genuinely repentant inmates or those facing challenging circumstances.\nAzam Tarar highlighted the importance of long-term rehabilitation and directed the Secretary of Human Rights to form a dedicated committee focused on the rehabilitation and reintegration of eligible inmates.\nThis committee is to include the Inspector General of Prisons and the Secretary of Health, ensuring a comprehensive approach that combines correctional oversight with healthcare provisions.\nThe committee will be responsible for developing strategies to facilitate inmates’ transition back into society and reduce recidivism rates.\nThe minister further emphasized that remission policies must strike an essential balance between justice for victims and opportunities for inmate rehabilitation. These policies should be designed to promote genuine reform while safeguarding the principles of fairness and community safety.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
