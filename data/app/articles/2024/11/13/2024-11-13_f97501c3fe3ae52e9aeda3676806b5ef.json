The agency, responsible for maintaining the country’s civil registry, serves as the backbone of Pakistan’s identity verification and data management systems.\nChairman NADRA emphasized the organization’s vital role in supporting social protection through technology-driven solutions.\nThe delegation expressed interest in NADRA’s locally developed technology, particularly the All-in-One Registration Kit and Mobile Enrollment Kit, designed to facilitate comprehensive civil registration.
