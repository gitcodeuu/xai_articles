The prosecution brought Swati from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to the ATC after the IHC annulled his previous physical remand.\nThe IHC directed the authorities to place Swati on judicial remand, citing legal requirements.  The ATC then ordered his transfer to jail under judicial custody.\nSubsequently, Swati was presented before Judicial Magistrate Humaira Afzal, who, following IHC’s instructions, remanded him to judicial custody.\nAdvocates for the defence contended that since October 5, Swati has been detained, facing approximately twelve FIRs.The defence further noted that these FIRs had not been disclosed in prior submissions to the IHC.\nIn addition, the ATC has issued notices and summoned arguments from the prosecution on Swati’s post-arrest bail applications in seven of the pending cases.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
