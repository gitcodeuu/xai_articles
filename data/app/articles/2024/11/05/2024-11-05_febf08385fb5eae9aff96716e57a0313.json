SAPM on Power, Muhammad Ali, stated that in Pakistan, approximately 13 to 17 percent returns were given, which was twice the returns offered in any other country.\nMuhammad Ali opined that the government should step back from the power business and focus on developing power markets, as practiced in other countries.\nThe Chairman said that the dollar-based regime should be changed into rupees to provide immediate relief to the general public.\nDiscussing the delinking of bagasse from the international coal price for being a local raw material, Muhammad Ali reiterated that in other parts of the world, bagasse is not linked to the international coal price.\nAs a result of negotiations with the IPPs the task force has able to delink bagasse from the international coal price and converted it into a rupee-based system.
