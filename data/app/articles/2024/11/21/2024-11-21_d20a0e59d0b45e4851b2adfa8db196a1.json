The ICECO had the vision to collaborate with its member states for the transfer of technology and knowledge sharing as key pillars towards climate resilience, he added.\nThe collaborative approaches could also help in developing regional strategic cooperation on water conservation and other associated pertinent issues, the ICESCO DG said.\nSamaddin ASADOV, Chairman of the Board, Azercosmos Space Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan said the country has increased its capacities to ensure satellite-based data coverage of its climate vulnerable sectors to arrange digital data modelling and space data collection for informed decision making and proactive policy decisions.\nHe said in terms of biodiversity nearly half of the world’s population relied on natural resources which underscored the need for better preparedness and conservation measures through better information of climatic impacts on the vulnerable sectors to ensure better planning and decision-making.\nStewart Maginnis, Deputy Director General Programme, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said biodiversity conservation was a ‘one stich saves a nine’ strategy that helped in managing carbon sinks, soil health improvement and ensuring agricultural diversification.\nHe commended that the ICESCO efforts were complementing in averting conflicts through better management of natural resources as ecosystem and biodiversity were one of the key areas in that regard.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
