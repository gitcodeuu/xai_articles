The programme will leverage the £108m the UK puts in to mobilize 5-6 times that amount of investment from the private sector.\nThe launch event, held in Islamabad, was also attended by Muhammad Aurangzeb, Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Ali Pervaiz Malik, Minister of State for Finance, Revenue, and Power and Musadik Masood Malik, Federal Minister for Water Resources.\nAnnouncing the new funding in Islamabad, Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer said, the UK and Pakistan have a long history of working together to tackle tomorrow’s threats today.

We are pleased to be partnering with the UK on an innovative facility that will help crowd-in much needed private investment.”\n“As a leading global investor in climate finance, IFC aims to leverage its experience and catalyze private sector financing for climate-smart investments in Pakistan and build a sustainable climate finance ecosystem.”\nToday’s announcement follows the launch of the British High Commission, Pakistan supported Cost of Inaction Report, which highlights the estimated cost of inaction on climate change for Pakistan is over one trillion dollars over the next 25 years.\nThe announcement marks the conclusion of a two-day visit to Pakistan by Hamish Falconer, Minister for the Middle East.\nThe Minister also met with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Ishaq Dar, and Interior Minister, Mohsin Naqvi, to discuss shared values and address common challenges, including and regional and global security.
