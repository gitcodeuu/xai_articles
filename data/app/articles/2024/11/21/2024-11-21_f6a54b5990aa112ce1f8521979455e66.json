For countries like Pakistan, adapting agricultural practices to a changing climate is not a choice but a necessity. We call for global collaboration to integrate innovative solutions that ensure food security for all,” Goheer, who is Pakistan’s lead negotiator, said.\nTalking to media here in Baku on the sidelines of the COP29 global climate summit, Arif Goheer said advocating for increased adaptation financing is what Pakistan is pushing for at the climate negotiations with countries from the global south including China.\nAdaptation finance is must to deal with the disproportionate impacts of climate change in developing countries and that there is a pressing need for scalable solutions to protect vulnerable communities, Pakistan’s lead climate negotiator Arif Goheer remarked.\n“Adaptation is our first line of defense against climate impacts. Developing countries cannot bear the costs of adaptation alone. We demand that adaptation financing be scaled up and delivered equitably to shield our people from climate-induced adversities,” he told the media.\nGoheer stressed the critical role of technology transfer in bridging the gap between developed and developing nations, calling for affordable and accessible climate-friendly innovations tailored to local contexts.\n“Technology is the bridge to a sustainable future. However, without equitable access, developing nations will remain on the sidelines. Pakistan demands a just framework that ensures technological solutions reach those who need them most,” he emphasised.\nGoheer said he has been also strongly advocating for capacity-building initiatives to enable developing countries to meet reporting requirements under the Paris Agreement, stressing the importance of fostering trust through robust and inclusive transparency frameworks.\nHe told the media, “Transparency is the foundation of accountability and trust in climate action. We must empower developing countries with the resources and training needed to fulfill their commitments and ensure a fair and balanced system.”\nGlobal Recognition of Leadership Arif Goheer’s role garnered widespread acclaim, with negotiators commending his methodical, science-informed approach and steadfast dedication to the principles of climate justice.\nHis active involvement exemplified Pakistan’s pivotal role in influencing global climate governance, amplifying its advocacy for immediate, equitable, and impactful solutions to the escalating climate crisis.\nAs COP29 progresses, Goheer continues to champion Pakistan’s stance, ensuring the voices of vulnerable nations resonate in global climate dialogues.",
