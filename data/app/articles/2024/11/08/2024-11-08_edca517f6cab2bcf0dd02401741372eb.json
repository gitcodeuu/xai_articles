  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 08 (APP): Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting, National Heritage and Culture\nAttaullah Tarar on Friday said the national economy had not only been stabilised\nbut now it was on the path of growth despite Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf tactics to\ncreate disorder and chaos.\nAddressing a press conference, he said economic stability and growth had now\nstarted to benefit common man. He said the price of wheat and flour and petroleum\nproducts had markedly decreased in addition to reduced electricity tariff.\nCurrently, all economic indicators were positive and foreign exchange\nreserves had crossed $ 11 billion mark, besides enhanced foreign\nremittances, he added.\nHe said that the Prime Minister was working day and night to improvise the\neconomy and milestones achieved on the economic front were\nthe outcome of his efforts.\nHe said a United Arab Emirates delegation would be visiting\nPakistan to discuss prospects for investment.\nHe said due to the efforts of the Prime Minister, Saudi Arabia, UAE\nand Qatar were investing in Pakistan whereas Azerbaijan had also\nannounced 2 billion dollars investment in Pakistan.\n“The Prime Minister will leave for Saudi Arabia on November 10 to\nparticipate in the Riyadh Summit on the issue of Palestine. A detailed\ndiscussion will be held on the situation in the Middle East at the\nRiyadh Summit”, he said.\nHe said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had always raised the issue of\nPalestine and ongoing Gaza genocide at every forum including World\nEconomic Forum and United Nations General Assembly.\nTarar said that the Prime Minister’s speech at the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly was the most watched speech worldwide as he had\nrepresented the sentiments of entire Muslim Ummah.\nHe disclosed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will also participate\nin the meeting of COP 29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nLashing out at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on its announcement to march\ntowards Islamabad again, he said that Tehreek-e-Inteshar was still sticking\nto its policy of creating chaos and disorder in the country.\nHe said that the PTI was hell bent on disrupting the peace and tranquility in the\ncountry by organizing protests, just to seek concessions for its jailed\nleader and added they would get no NRO.\nHe wondered why the PTI was organising a public rally in Swabi as its\npast rallies in Lahore and Islamabad had proved to be fiasco and they\nhad to cancel it altogether in Quetta.\nHe lamented that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government was misusing its powers to\nsuppress the rights of teachers in the province.\nThe voice of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa teachers should be heard and their\ndemands be accepted as the education system in the province was\nin ruins, he added.\nIn Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he opined the provincial government had no\ndevelopment agenda and no attention had been given to the affairs of\nthe youth and added talented sports stars and innovative youth were totally\nignored.\nHe said that the only focus of the KP chief minister was on protest\nrallies and marches for release of the PTI founder who had been\nfacing trial on corruption charges.\nHe said on the one hand Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was striving\nfor development and prosperity of the country and on the other hand,\nthe PTI was working on an anti-state agenda to damage national\ninterests.\nHe said that those who attacked the vehicle of Qazi Faez Isa will be\nbrought to justice and nobody will be allowed to indulge in such\nactivities.\nHe said that the results of the Supreme Court Bar Election was a\nmanifestation of the legal fraternity’s support for the 26th\nConstitutional Amendment. He said that defeat of PTI backed panels in\nSupreme Court Bar Association elections had exposed the claims of its\npopularity.\nThe PTI leadership wanted Pakistan to default, but by the Grace of\nAllah, Pakistan had come out of its danger. They wrote letters\nto the International Monetary Fund, but Pakistan successfully reached\nan agreement with the IMF, he added.\nThe PTI attacked national institutions on May 9 but failed in its\nagenda of weakening them, he added.\nTarar said that the people had refused to take to streets on the call\nof KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur who had left party workers on roads and\nhimself took refuge in KP House.\nThe minister said that Pakistan cricket team’s historic victory\nagainst Australia in a one day international match in Adelaide was\nencouraging.\nHe expressed the optimism that Pakistan cricket team will soon regain its\npast status through hard work and commitment.\nWinning the Test series against England and levelling the ongoing ODI\nseries against Australia will prove to be the beginning of a new era for\nPakistan cricket, he remarked.\nReplying to media persons questions, he said Pakistan enjoyed time\ntested friendship with China and there was no impediment in its\nfurther growth in future.\nHe said China Pakistan Economic Corridor was the lifeline of the\ncountry and with completion of its second phase, Pakistan’s relations\nwith China will reach to new level.\nTo a question, he said that PTI founder had snubbed his party leaders\nfor giving proposals for a constitutional amendment package since his\nsole agenda was his release from jail.\nAnswering a question about Donald Trump’s victory in US elections, he\nsaid that in the past the PTI had built a fake narrative of ‘absolutely\nnot’ and now they were claiming new US president will get Imran Khan\nreleased from jail.\nHe ruled out any concession to jailed PTI founder by stating\nthat he had to defend himself in courts on corruption charges and\nthere was no other way out for him.",
