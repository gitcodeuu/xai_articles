  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 8 (APP): Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed on Friday outlined a five-point action plan for Palestine and Middle East’s peace and calls for Arab-OIC Emergency Summit on November 11 to take concrete steps to alleviate the sufferings of the Palestinian people.\nIn his keynote address at IPI Conference on Middle East here, the senator said the first step should be for Arab-OIC Emergency Summit on November 11 to take concrete steps to alleviate the sufferings of the Palestinian people and take the lead by forming an International Leaders Delegation, also comprising leaders from the Global South and Europe, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkiye, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, Algeria and Brazil, plus PMs of Norway and Ireland (as they have recognized the State of Palestine) who should visit Washington immediately to meet President-elect Donald Trump.\nThey should urge the new US President to reverse the one-sided American policy of blatantly supporting Israel, have ceasefire immediately, provide humanitarian assistance and to take steps for lasting peace through establishment of an independent Palestine State.\nSecond, he said that given their strong Navies, Turkiye, Pakistan and Indonesia should form a Joint Naval Humanitarian Flotilla for Peace to help break the Israeli blockade of Gaza after getting authorization from the UN General Assembly.\n“This will send a powerful and positive message to the oppressed Palestinian people that the Muslim Ummah is not an impotent entity, rather it has the vision and political will to undertake concrete initiatives.”\nThird, recalling the joint initiative of President Erdogan and Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir in 2019 to launch a global Media initiative to promote the perspective of the Muslim Ummah in the ‘battle of ideas and narratives’, Mushahid said ‘now is the right time and opportunity for such an initiative as the Gaza Genocide has demonstrated how biased and one-sided the Western media has been in the current crisis’.\nHe said journalists, scholars, intellectuals, academics, and think tanks could be powerful instruments in the ‘Battle of Ideas’ crafting and presenting narratives based on truth and facts, while representing the popular aspirations of the Global South in general and Muslim World in particular on such issues as Palestine, Kashmir, Islamophobia and Rohingya, helping to prepare the ground for an alternative emerging equitable global order.\nFourth, he said that OIC immediately establish a Palestine Reconstruction Fund for reconstruction of devastated areas of Gaza as well as Lebanon.\nFifth, the senator added that establish a Nuremberg-style International War Crimes Tribunal for 2 purposes: a) establish War Reparations Fund for victims of Genocide in Palestine and Lebanon; b) form a global group of eminent jurists, lawyers and jurists to try Israeli political and military leaders for crimes against humanity and all other war crimes committed after October, 07, 2023, including acts of aggression against Palestine, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq and Syria.\nMushahid said, ”OIC has lost credibility with Muslim masses as an organization that is suffering from paralysis, unable to act during crises’, adding ‘Muslim states have affluence without influence’.",
