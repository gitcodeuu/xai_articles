Azerbaijan responded by launching a counter-offensive, marking the start of what is now called the Patriotic War. This struggle led to a pivotal victory, ending decades-long occupation and restoring Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity under the leadership of President Ilham Aliyev.\nThis victory also enforced four UN Security Council resolutions, unimplemented for years, confirming Azerbaijan’s sovereignty and the return of displaced communities to their homes. With the liberation of its lands, Azerbaijan committed to advancing peace and stability in the region.\nOn September 19-20, 2023, Azerbaijan conducted  operations to remove the last remaining Armenian armed forces in the Garabagh region, effectively ending the presence of illegal forces. Azerbaijan now calls on Armenia to approach the peace process constructively, recognizing the new reality for sustainable regional stability.\nThroughout these years, Pakistan has stood as a strong ally, openly supporting Azerbaijan during the Patriotic War, high-ranking Pakistani officials voiced their support, reinforcing the shared commitment between the nations.\nPakistan’s refusal to establish diplomatic ties with Armenia because of the occupation and Azerbaijan’s support for Pakistan on the Jammu and Kashmir issue underscore a mutual respect for international law and brotherhood, the press release added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
