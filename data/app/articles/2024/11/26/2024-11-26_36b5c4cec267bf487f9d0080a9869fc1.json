She said that violence and inflicting damages on public properties in the name of protest is unacceptable.\nChairperson of BISP said that the attitude of the PTI leadership is against the principles of peace, saying rioting in the guise of protest will not be tolerated under any circumstances.\nShe added that attacks on the security personnel speak of the politics of anarchy. She said that political parties should be the guarantor of people’s safety, not a threat to their lives.\nSenator Robina Khalid said that such attitude of the Tehreek-e-Insaaf against law enforcement agencies is condemnable. She said that law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is deteriorating, but, Chief Minister is busy in attacking the federation with the entire official machinery and resources.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
