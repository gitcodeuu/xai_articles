The Criminal Laws Amendment Bill was also passed to strengthen the criminal justice system.\nSeveral other bills were deferred or referred for further consideration, including the Pakistan Penal Code Amendment Bill, the Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Amendment Bill, the Shamilat Land Protection Bill, and the Anti-Terrorism Amendment Bill, among others. Committee members requested input from various ministries and departments for further review of these measures.\nThe committee addressed public safety issues raised by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who advocated for allowing the general public equal access to tinted car windows as a security measure. Rising street crime and armed robbery incidents in Islamabad were also discussed, with the chairman calling for a report on crime rates and response measures.\nSenators Danesh Kumar and Kamran Murtaza highlighted the kidnapping of Priya Kumari and recent terrorism incidents in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, though further discussion was postponed due to the absence of these senators.\nThe committee, attended by multiple senators and senior government officials, remains focused on enhancing public safety and governance through legislative action.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
