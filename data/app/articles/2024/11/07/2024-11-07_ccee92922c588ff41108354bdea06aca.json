  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 7 (APP):President of Digital Platforms of Jazz Aamer Ejaz has urged students to stay adaptable, technologically fluent, and resilient to succeed in an evolving job market.\nSpeaking at the Institute of Space Technology (IST) on the theme Campus to Corporate – Steps to be Ready, he outlined how AI and emerging technologies are reshaping industries, advising students to leverage these advancements to maintain a competitive edge.\nThe audience included final-year computer science students, IST faculty, and management.\nDescribing AI as a collaborative tool he said, “AI isn’t artificial intelligence; it’s augmented intelligence. It complements your abilities while keeping you in the driver’s seat.” Citing Jazz’s AI-driven products, like the SIMOSA chatbot, he emphasized how such technologies are enhancing user experiences.\nHe warned that staying static in a rapidly advancing world is akin to falling behind.\nHe also shared practical advice for bridging the gap between academia and industry, emphasizing skills like adaptability, resilience, and a business-oriented mindset as essential for professional growth.\n“There are no guaranteed jobs, job security, pensions, or seniority in the corporate world; success requires continuous learning and a proactive approach to career development,” he stated.\nHe further highlighted the challenge of retaining tech talent in Pakistan, noting that while skilled professionals often find better opportunities abroad, it’s vital to create avenues for this talent to contribute to local innovation.\n“Our focus should be on nurturing homegrown talent to build indigenous products and services,” he added.\nCommenting on the rapid pace of change, he encouraged students to view failure as a valuable learning opportunity. He shared an example of a discontinued Jazz product that led to valuable insights, ultimately resulting in successful platforms like Tamasha and SIMOSA. “Our goal shouldn’t be unicorn startups alone but an enabling ecosystem that supports sustainable growth,” he added.\nHe underscored Jazz’s transformation from a telco to a ServiceCo—a forward-looking digital conglomerate that encompasses platforms like JazzCash, Tamasha, SIMOSA, Bajao, Garaj, GAMENOW, and ROX, cementing Jazz’s position in the digital landscape.\nAamer Ejaz highlighted the importance of empathy, teamwork, and networking. “Success is rarely achieved alone; genuine connections and understanding others’ perspectives are critical,” he said, urging students to engage in collaborative, agenda-free discussions to build essential skills.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
