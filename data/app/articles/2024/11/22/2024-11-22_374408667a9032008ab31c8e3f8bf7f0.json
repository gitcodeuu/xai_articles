  "content": "Earlier, in her address, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said the canal project would bring about prosperity in Balochistan besides enhancing closeness among the provinces.\nShe said the credit for all mega public welfare projects like motorways, scholarships to youth, modern transport facilities including Orange Line, Metro or Speedo buses and student bikes went to the PML-N governments.\nShe said that having removed the risks of defaults, the PML-N government successfully revived the economy as the stock exchange was breaking records, inflation was down to 7% and remittances were on the rise.\nComing to the PTI’s call for the march, the Punjab chief minister said the people were not paying heed to their calls which were flopping one after the other.\nCriticising the statement by PTI founder’s spouse regarding Saudi Arabia, she said it wasn’t mere terrorism disrupting the progress rather the acts of attacking the other province by KP chief minister were also “very dangerous and beyond understanding.”\nBalochistan CM Balochistan Sarfaraz Bugti said Punjab always welcomed not only the people from Balochistan but all ethnicities for employment or education and those carrying out the targeted killings in his province were the terrorists killing Pakistanis.\nHe told the prime minister that the next 100-kilometer second phase of the canal needed no lined canal as it would require huge funds for construction as well as repair. He said the project could be completed within three to four months if the federal government extended support.\nMinister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal said that the federal government was prioritising Balochistan’s uplift through an enhanced allocation of funds and share in the development portfolio. However, those who were disrupting peace in the province were not friends but foes of Balochistan and agents of foreign forces desiring to fight a proxy war like Afghanistan.\nHe said the government was pursuing the agenda to employ youth and provide connectivity with Balochistan.\nHe told the gathering that during the previous government, all projects in Gwadar were put to a halt and were revived by the PML-N government including the completion of port dredging to convert it back to the deep sea port costing Rs4 billion.\nAhsan Iqbal said the government had formulated a five-year development program to be unveiled by the prime minister on November 28.\nMinister for Water Resources Musaddik Malik said the prime minister was pursuing a vision to prioritise employment and reducing inflation. He said the Kachhi Canal was not mere a project to irrigate land but an initiative to revive life in the desert and usher in a new era of prosperity.\nLt. Gen. (Retd) Sajjad Ghani said as per the prime minister’s directives, the initial phase of the Kachhi canal had been completed in 45 days to irrigate around 715,000 acres of land in Balochistan.\nShehbaz Sharif said that Saudi Arabia attached no strings or preconditions to its support to Pakistan and the current leadership had also asked its administration to invest in Pakistan as MoUs worth billions of dollars had already been signed.",
