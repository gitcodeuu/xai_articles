Proactive and result-oriented steps must be taken for local communities so that the fight against climate change can be genuinely effective.”\nPraising the high-level he said, organization of COP29, the climate activist described the remarkable efforts of volunteers during the event. “Volunteers in the city have been assisting us everywhere, from metro stations to hotels and streets. Such meticulous organizational work greatly contributes to the success of the event,” he noted.\nDidar Ali also underlined the significance of amplifying the voices of young people and noted that COP29 provided a platform for the younger generation, inspiring them to take an active role in combating climate change.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
