He proposed sentence remissions to inmates who achieve educational excellence during their confinement, aligning with broader rehabilitation goals.\nThe meeting also focused on the LJCP’s proposed National Jail Reform Policy, which aligns with international standards, including the Nelson Mandela Rules, Bangkok Rules, and Beijing Rules.\nThis policy aims to ensure the humane and rehabilitative management of correctional facilities across Pakistan.
