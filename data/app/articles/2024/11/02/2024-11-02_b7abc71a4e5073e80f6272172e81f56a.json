The government was committed to bring the inflation rate down to a single digit by 2025, he added.\nHe further said that the Pakistani rupee had stabilized, indicating a positive trend in the economic landscape.\nAnswering a question, he said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) often engages in unnecessary political point-scoring, especially on constitutional, economic, foreign, and policy issues.\nThe KP government, he said, should focus on addressing the public’s issues rather than getting entangled in Imran Khan’s personal politics and anti-federal propaganda.\nHe said that the KP government should prioritize education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation for the welfare of the people.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
