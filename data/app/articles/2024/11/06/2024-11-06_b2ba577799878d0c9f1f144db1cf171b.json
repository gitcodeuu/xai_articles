One heavily polluting vehicle was impounded and moved to the police station.\nAccording to Deputy Commissioner Islamabad, Irfan Memon, these daily inspections are part of the city’s broader effort to manage air pollution and reduce smog.\nWarning letters have been issued to non-compliant vehicles, with fines imposed where necessary. The administration’s preemptive measures aim to keep pollution under control as winter approaches, bringing with it heightened risks of smog.\nThe district’s intensified approach reflects a commitment to cleaner air and public health protection, as enforcement continues against sources of pollution citywide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
