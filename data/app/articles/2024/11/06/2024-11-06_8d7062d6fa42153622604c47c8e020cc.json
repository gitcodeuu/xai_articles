  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 06 (APP):Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain on Wednesday emphasized the crucial role of Pakistan’s agricultural sector in the country’s economy, contributing 24% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nAddressing the Sustainable Development Conference, the minister highlighted the need for modern technologies to combat climate change, which severely impacts agriculture through unpredictable rainfall and other weather extremes.\nHe said that Pakistan ranks 5th globally in vulnerability to climate change.\nThe minister said that as a key stakeholder in the agricultural sector, The Pakistan Agricultural Research Council’s (PARC)must adopt innovation and new technologies to address these challenges. It must also develop and promote seed varieties that are resilient to climate change and can thrive in low-fertility soils.\nUnder the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP), Rs 210 million has been allocated for the establishment of the Consumer Resource Seed and Authenticity System, along with funding for research and development.\nAdditionally, Rs 276.95 million has been allocated for seed certification labs in Khuzdar and Turbat, which are making significant contributions.\nPARC variety evaluation committee has introduced 10 high-yielding pulse varieties to enhance agricultural production. These varieties are expected to boost pulse productivity, which is critical for global food security and nutrition.\nHe also emphasized the importance of adopting modern technologies, such as satellite imaging and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to improve agricultural productivity and efficiency.\n“To achieve our objectives, it is essential to collaborate with local communities, the private sector, international organizations, and NGOs. Solo efforts will not yield the desired results,” he said.\nThe PSDP National Program for Water Courses in Pakistan, phase-II, is currently underway to improve the productivity of irrigation systems.\nThis initiative promotes efficient irrigation techniques and aims to enhance agricultural production and create job opportunities in rural areas. The project also focuses on the conservation of land and water resources, he added.\n“We need to provide farmers with seeds that offer high yields and are resilient to climate change,” Tanveer remarked.\nUnder the partnership between PARC and South Korea for agricultural innovation, Pakistan will cultivate virus-free potato crops.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
