Israel has been emboldened with the international community’s indifference and inaction. “There has been an utter disregard for humanity’s repeated calls for a ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian relief and protection of civilians”.\nWhile houses with the occupants were being blown up, he said, the most sophisticated weapons were being supplied to Israel. Indeed, it was assured of unconditional assistance and support.\nThe prime minister said the International laws which were meant to protect the vulnerable had been torn to shreds. “Humanity is being tested and failing while Gaza bleeds, the world watches in deafening silence,” he added.\nPrime Minister Sharif further said after decades of sufferings and oppression, the spirit of resistance of the Palestinians remained unbridled and flames of defiance burnt brighter even under the relentless siege.\n“Pakistan stands firm in its commitment to Palestine right to self-determination. We reiterate our unwavering support to establish an independent, viable and contiguous state of Palestine with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its Capital based upon its pre-1967 borders,” he reaffirmed Pakistan’s stance.\nThe prime minister said that it was the only avenue for justice and durable peace in the holy land.\nHe said Pakistan strongly condemned Israel’s recent strikes against Iran as an outright violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, adding “We equally denounce Israel’s ongoing aggression against Lebanon and stand in complete solidarity with its people.”\nHe cautioned that such escalation by Israel constituted a dangerous threat that could unleash a broader war.\nThe prime minister expressed the hope that this summit would be a moment to transform their words into action. “Together they should move beyond condemnation and act swiftly to uphold justice and dignity for the people of Palestine and all those who faced oppression.”\nHe also expressed his profound gratitude to the sagacious Saudi leadership for convening the summit.",
