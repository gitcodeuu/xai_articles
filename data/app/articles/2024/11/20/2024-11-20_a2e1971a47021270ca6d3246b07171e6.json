Similarly, afghan refugee camps are been mobilized for the purpose.\nHe suggested the PTI leaders withdraw the call of protest and sit at the table for dialogue. The government was ready to accept their legitimate demand if any, Wali advised.\nWhile highlighting the corruption in KP, he noted, “Entire KP province is in the grips of dengue due to bad health policies”\nHe alleged that nepotism and bribery were on the rise, “Rs 100 to 150 million being asked against the post of commissioner.”\nHe maintained that a large sum of money had been spent on account of salaries for the Billion Trees Tsunami Project; however, it is unknown where the plants’ saplings vanished. “The transfer and posting of police in the province was also being managed,” Wali said.\nThe PML-N leader said that thousands of schools in KP are out of basic facilities for children.\nWali praised the law enforcement agencies for restoring peace in the province, insisting that “until terrorism persisted, the economy could not prosperous rapidly”.\nHe reiterated the prime minister’s stance that anyone who tried to create trouble in the development of the country would not be spared.",
