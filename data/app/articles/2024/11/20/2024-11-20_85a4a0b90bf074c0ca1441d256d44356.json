The delegation also includes representatives from Saudi Arabia, which recently pledged $500 million to global polio efforts.\nKey members of the visiting delegation include Dr. Chris Elias, Chair of the Polio Oversight Board and President of Global Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

With activities spanning over 120 countries, AFD finances public sector projects, supports NGOs, and contributes to global goals like climate action, education, and healthcare. Its ongoing work underscores France’s commitment to international solidarity and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe collaboration between the Government of Pakistan, international donors, and agencies highlights the importance of collective action in tackling polio.
