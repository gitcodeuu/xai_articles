He said that while trains were currently facing delays due to smog and adverse weather conditions, Pakistan Railways continues its operations even when airports and motorways are closed. “Our priority is the safety of passengers over addressing delays,” he stated.\nThe CEO further assured that he is personally overseeing train schedules and that efforts are being made to resolve issues impacting punctuality. To enhance convenience, the names and phone numbers of train managers will soon be prominently displayed in all trains.\nHe announced plans to upgrade two to three trains in the near future and introduce a new service with fewer stops. Additionally, the much-anticipated ML-1 project is expected to commence within two to three months, while phased restoration of discontinued trains is underway.\nDiscussing future initiatives, he revealed that regional connectivity projects, involving billions of dollars in investment, are being actively pursued.
