  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 20 (APP): The International Education group of Cambridge University Press & Assessment (Cambridge) Wednesday announced the launch of a new climate literacy programme in Pakistan designed to help students develop climate awareness and become engaged in climate and sustainability issues.\nEducation is recognised as a major strategy to mitigate climate change because it plays a crucial role in equipping current and future generations with the holistic knowledge and skills to address climate-related challenges at local, national, and global levels.\nCalled Cambridge Climate Quest, the programme is a two-and-a-half-hour free online course that will be available to all learners enrolled in all educational boards across Pakistan.\nThe programme is tailored to Pakistan and students will learn about local climate change-induced events such as the floods of 2010, the heatwave in 2017 and the current high levels of air pollution in Lahore.\nStudents will also be able to explore some of the country’s national plans and policies for climate control, such as national flood protection plans.\nUzma Yousuf, Country Director, Pakistan, Cambridge University Press & Assessment is the Climate Quest Ambassador for Pakistan and will spearhead the Cambridge Climate Quest programme.\nUzma said: “Climate change education is more vital now than ever considering the challenges Pakistan and the world is facing as a result of changing climate, and weather uncertainties.\nThis programme will play an important role in allowing students to understand climate change from both a local and global perspective and equip them with the tools to think about solutions for a greener and healthier planet through practical examples. We will work with the government and the Ministry for Climate Change to ensure that this free resource reaches the maximum number of students.”\nRod Smith, Group Managing Director, International Education, Cambridge University Press & Assessment said: “Education is an essential tool for combating climate change but its potential is still far from being realised. Bringing a bespoke programme to Pakistan will help support students to be ready for a climate-changed world.”\nIntegrating climate change education across the curriculum “In Ready for the world: empowering learners through climate change education”, Cambridge explains how it is working to embed climate change education across the curriculum for 3 -19-year-old – not just in subjects commonly associated with climate change such as geography or science.\nThis multidisciplinary approach equips learners both with knowledge about climate change, and with the values, attitudes and skills to understand and address climate change.\nCambridge has also established a community of school leaders on climate change education to gather insights on how climate change education is best delivered in the classroom and this community seeks stronger representation from school leaders in Pakistan.\nThe willing students are encouraged to register:\nwww.cambridgeinternational.org/climate-change-Community.",
