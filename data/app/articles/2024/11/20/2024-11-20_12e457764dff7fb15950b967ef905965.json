RELO Pakistan supports public diplomacy outreach through professional development and English language learning opportunities for English language teachers and learners throughout Pakistan.\nIn this regard HEC and RELO jointly organized and inaugurated the English Faculty Development Training Program at NAHE HEC Islamabad.\nThis highly anticipated event, scheduled from 20th to 22nd November 2024, brings together English language educators from across Pakistan, particularly from Islamabad and Rawalpindi, to enhance their teaching expertise.\nThe program focuses on three key themes aimed at addressing modern challenges and opportunities in English language education. It includes Teaching Language through Literature, Exploring Culture in the Language Classroom, and Redesigning Assignments in the Age of AI.\nThe opening ceremony was chaired by Managing Director of NAHE, Noor Amna Malik.\nAddressing the audience, Malik emphasized the importance of continuous professional development for educators, stating, that empowering teachers through such training programs is a cornerstone for advancing the quality of higher education in Pakistan. These initiatives help bridge gaps and foster innovative teaching practices to meet evolving educational demands, she added.\nShe said that this program is a unique opportunity for educators to refine their skills and explore contemporary pedagogical methods, ensuring students receive an education that is both innovative and globally relevant. However, she advised all participants to cascade their three-day learning to their colleagues.\nOn the occasion , Regional English Language Officer, Jerrold Frank highlighted the importance of fostering global connections and integrating cultural awareness into language teaching. He expressed his appreciation for the collaborative efforts of NAHE in strengthening English language education in the country and arranging a very holistic cross section of participants.\nHe assured full support in extending RELO initiatives to all the Teachers of Pakistani HEIs in letter and spirit and assured to soon sign a long-term Letter of intent with HEC for a sustainable partnership towards this important endeavour.\nThe program featured Dr. Patricia Pashby, an internationally renowned English Language Specialist, as the lead Resource Person.\nDr. Pashby brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the training sessions, engaging participants in interactive and thought-provoking workshops. She has taught English as a foreign language in higher education for over 30 years.\nAt the University of Oregon, she taught courses in language teaching methodology, pronunciation instruction, and integrating culture and literature in the language classroom as part of the Language Teaching Studies MA Program in the Department of Linguistics.\nShe has conducted numerous faculty development workshops in the US as well as in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Pakistan, Egypt, and Colombia. Her interests include intercultural communication, curriculum design, EMI, teacher education, and testing/training international teaching assistants.\nThe training program has drawn nominations from educational institutions nationwide, providing an exceptional platform for educators to exchange ideas, learn from experts, and adopt best practices in teaching English.\nThe NAHE remained committed to fostering excellence in higher education through such initiatives, equipping educators with the tools to navigate the dynamic landscape of teaching in the 21st century.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
