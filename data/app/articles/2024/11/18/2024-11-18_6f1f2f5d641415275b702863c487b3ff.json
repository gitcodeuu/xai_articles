  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 18 (APP):Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting, National Heritage and Culture Attaullah Tarar on Monday said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Zaheer Abbas Khokhar was wasting time of Election Tribunal by seeking several adjustments.\nHe was giving his reaction as Zaheer Abbas Khokhar took another  adjustment in the  application challenging election of Attaullah Tarar in NA 127, in February 8 general elections.\nThe minister said his  lawyers appeared in the Election Tribunal and they were fully prepared having  all the documents.\nThe opposite party had no evidence or proof, he maintained.\n“Zaheer Abbas Khokhar wants to escape from the court, that’s why he requested the court to adjourn the hearing,”  he remarked.\n“If he had evidence, why did Zaheer Abbas Khokhar ask for an adjournment,” he asked.\nCriticising Zaheer Abbas, he said he had challenged his (Tarar’s) victory but now he was  repeatedly seeking adjustments and  wasting the time of the Election Tribunal.\nHe said if the PTI candidate had no evidence, he should admit it.\nHe alleged that it has become the habit of the PTI leadership to first file a case in the courts and then run away by seeking adjustment after adjustment.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
