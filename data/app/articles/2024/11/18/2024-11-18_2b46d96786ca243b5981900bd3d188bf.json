  "content": "LAHORE, Nov 18 (APP):Punjab Food Authority (PFA) Director General Asim Javed led food safety teams early Monday morning to Temple Road and Thokar Niaz Baig areas to conduct inspections and sealed four eateries besides imposing fines on 21 outlets.\nA total of 42 breakfast points were checked and four eateries were sealed besides imposing a fine of Rs 625,000 on 21 food points.\nThe closures were due to extremely poor hygiene conditions, according to the DG Food\nAuthority. Heavy fines were imposed as repeated warnings and improvement notices had been ignored by the owners.\nThe inspection revealed substandard storage, filthy freezers, rusty utensils and a prevalence of insects. Expired meat and rotten vegetables were found stored in freezers covered with mold.\nOpen drains, dirty washing areas, and foul odors were observed, while essential records\nand employee medical certificates were missing.\n“Food prepared with substandard ingredients can pose severe health risks,” stated Asim Javed.\nHe emphasized that regular checks were being carried out at all food points to curb health hazards.\nThe DG noted that food safety teams were conducting continuous operations in Punjab to eradicate the mafia involved in adulteration and fraud.\n“We are implementing measures to bring all stages of food preparation and delivery in line with international standards,” he said.\nAsim Javed urged the public to support the PFA in tackling counterfeit food products, calling these perpetrators a menace to society. He encouraged citizens to report violations by calling the complaint helpline at 1223.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
