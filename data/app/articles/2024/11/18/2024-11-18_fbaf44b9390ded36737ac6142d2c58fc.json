  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 18 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday served notices to respondents in a petition against the decision of the central selection board of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) regarding the promotion of officers.\nThe court instructed the secretary Ministry of Interior to submit a report on November 21, after deciding on the applications of petitioners. Justice Babar Sattar heard the case filed by FIA officers including Bakhtiar Cheema and others.\nThe court said in its order regarding the hearing that the petitioners’ lawyer said that they were affectees of the working papers sent by the establishment division and other respondents regarding the promotions from BPS-19 to BPS-20. They stated that the available cadre positions for the posts of director law BPS-20 were told wrongly. If the correct position was told then the petitioners could be considered for these posts.\nThe petitioners said that working papers had mentioned only one post but as per rules, four seats are vacant. They said that they had also filed a presentation of secretary law but no decision was made.\nThe court instructed the secretary of law to take a decision on representation with the reasons and produce it at the next hearing.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
