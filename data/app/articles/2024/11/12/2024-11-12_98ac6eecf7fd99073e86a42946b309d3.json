In response, the CEC instructed him to submit a written explanation.\nFawad Chaudhary argued that the issue of contempt should be considered resolved once an apology is offered, but the ECP’s Balochistan member pointed out, “If issues are resolved in this manner, contempt will continue to occur.”\nThe Election Commission later adjourned the hearing of the contempt case against Fawad Chaudhary until December 10.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
