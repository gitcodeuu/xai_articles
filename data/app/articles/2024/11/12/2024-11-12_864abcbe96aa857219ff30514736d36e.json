Out of these, he said, about 33 lakes were estimated at the risk of outburst flooding, putting lives of over 7million people in danger.\n“This is a very grave situation and demands urgent action. Glaciers 2025 Initiative provides a unique opportunity; to focus on global attention on this crisis and drive the coordinated efforts to further stem the glacial melt,” he stressed.\nPrime Minister Sharif stressed that they must act and act now not only for these glaciers, but for the survival of people and the communities that depended upon them in various parts of the world.\nHe also emphasized upon the regional collaboration which he said was a key to many of the actions needed to keep these life sources safe from pollution and snow melt, adding the science of data sharing and standardized method of glacial monitoring and the ability of the countries to track glaciers health and develop strategy for sustainable water usage were extremely critical.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan being the most affected country, required enhanced support to monitoring glacier health and early warning systems, adopt climate-resilient agriculture practices and invest in alternative water solutions.\nHe said that the observance of international year for Glaciers 2025, should send a message loud and clear for mitigating impacts upon glaciers, protecting of the eco-system, and the sustainable storage of water for the future.\nHe said Pakistan was a home to a number of glaciers outside the Polar region and preventing the loss of these vital resources like glaciers was critical as they served as lifeline for millions of people around world.\nAbout 70 percent of fresh water was critical for the global water security, he added.\nThe prime minister also appreciated Tajik President for hosting the most important meeting attended by experts, scientists, world leaders and politicians, who would provide valuable contributions as to how to counter the fast-melting glaciers around the globe.\n“Let this be our legacy, when the glaciers thrive, the humanity flourishes,” he stressed.",
