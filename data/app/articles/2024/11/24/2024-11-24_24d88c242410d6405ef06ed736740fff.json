It is also essential to raise awareness about women’s rights and eliminate violence against them,” he stressed.\nThe president said that violence against women was a pervasive human rights issue that affected nearly one in three women globally.\nThe urgency for immediate and collective action could be gauged from the fact that thousands of women lost their lives annually in acts of violence, he observed.\n“This year’s theme “Every 10 Minutes, a Woman is Killed. #NoExcuse. UNiTE to End Violence against Women” calls upon us to increase investments in prevention strategies, survivor support, and systemic reforms to address this grave violation of human rights”, President House Media Wing, in a press release, quoted the president as saying.\nThe president said Pakistan stood committed to this cause, aligning its national efforts with this global call to action.\nFormer Prime Minister Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto championed the rights of women, he said, adding in her address at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, she called for economic independence, social equality, and education of women.\n‘She firmly believed in creating a society free from exploitation and maltreatment of women where they could rise to the highest level in politics, business, diplomacy, and other spheres of life,” he further added.\nThe president expressed his satisfaction that in Pakistan,  they were making meaningful efforts to end violence against women.\n“We have enacted laws to protect them against sexual violence, and harassment at workplaces. Pakistan has also established Family Protection Centres and Women’s Crisis Shelters and increased access to counselling, helplines, and legal aid.  Yet, we still have a long way to go. Violence continues to limit women’s access to education, employment, and equal opportunities, particularly for those in vulnerable communities,” he added.\nThrough their collective efforts, President Zardari said, they could create a safer environment where no woman was subjected to violence.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
