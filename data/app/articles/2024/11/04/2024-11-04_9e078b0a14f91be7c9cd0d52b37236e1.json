This fumigation drive brings peace of mind to families like mine,” said Naila Khan, a resident of F-7.\nSocial media has been buzzing with support for the campaign, with citizens sharing the hashtags #CDAHealthInitiative, #CDAcares, and #StopDengue to spread awareness.\n“CDA’s efforts to combat dengue are commendable. Every city should prioritize public health this way,” wrote a resident.\nCDA urged the residents to contribute by removing stagnant water from their homes and gardens and staying vigilant during the high-risk dengue season.\nThe authority is optimistic that, with community support and ongoing fumigation, Islamabad can successfully control the spread of dengue and safeguard public health.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
