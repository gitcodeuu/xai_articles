Then the country will move forward,” he said, adding that during the past eight months, there was no governance scam which reflected the strength of the government.\nHe thanked the chief ministers for their massive efforts and focus on improvement of economy, adding Punjab chief minister led with agriculture sector reforms, while the KP chief minister also got similar legislation approved from his cabinet. The Sindh chief minister was also making sincere efforts.\nThe prime minister also regretted that despite the valuable mineral wealth and brilliant minds the country possessed, billions of rupees had been wasted on litigation over Reko Diq and Chinot minerals reserves cases in the past.\n“We have to move in unison, though it may be a difficult task but no nation can emerge successful without unity,” he observed and cited the examples of Japan and Germany, that emerged stronger after the World Wars.\nThe prime minister enumerating government’s efforts, said that the task force on power sector had successfully negotiated with the five IPPs and with these efforts, they were moving step by step towards the right direction.\nHe also underlined that today, the well to do segment of the society had to make sacrifices for the country’s prosperity.\nThe prime minister said the country’s progress and prosperity was linked with peace and end to terrorism.\nWithout blaming anyone, he said that he could say that during Nawaz Sharif’s tenure in 2014, they were succeeded in effacing the menace of terrorism which was also acknowledged by the world.\nAt that time all the representatives of the entire nation and military leadership had gathered at this place to take unanimous decisions, he recollected.\nIn the year 2018, terrorism was eliminated from the country and in this fight, about 80,000 people had sacrificed their lives whereas the country suffered over $130 billion losses.\nHe said, recently, this specter again raised its head in KP and Balochistan provinces which required questions to be answered.\nIf not eliminated completely, the prime minister said, all their efforts which he had elaborated at the economic and political stability would come to naught.\nHe termed terrorism as the huge challenge for Pakistan. Certain parts of KP southern districts and Balochistan provinces were witnessing the worst incidents of barbarity at the hands of terrorists and stressed that its head should be crushed.\nThe prime minister also asked for reconsideration of calls for political sit-ins at the high-level events including SCO Conference in Islamabad and advised the political leaders to ponder over it with cold minds.\nHe said the country was no doubt dear to everyone, but the choice was for them as the ‘time and tide wait for none’.\nAbout other steps, the prime minister said that reforms were being taken in FBR to curb corruption and mismanagement.\nHe cited an incident in March this year, when an officer brought to the notice of his high ups, with a letter, that an account of 80-year-old women was used with collusion of certain employees for the purpose of fake inversion.\nIt could have resulted in loss of billions of rupees to the country if the scam had taken place. An amount of Rs370 million was already embezzled, he added.",
