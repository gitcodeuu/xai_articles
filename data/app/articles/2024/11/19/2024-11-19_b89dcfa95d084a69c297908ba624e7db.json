  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 19 (APP):Senator Faisal Vawda, on Tuesday described the upcoming protest of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) a face-saving tactic as the party lost its popularity in the country.\nAddressing a press conference, the senator claimed that “the protest call, of PTI, is like a bubble of water that will burst,” as this drama is only directed for the release of the PTI founder.\nHe added that the date was strategically chosen because charges against the PTI founder are going to be indicted on November 25.\nHe also accused the leaders of PTI for personal gains due to close proximity with the ex-premier. ”I hope no one takes advantage PTI founder detention”, he added.\nHe asserted that PTI has been divided among different factions. For the best interest of the country, he stated that the 26th amendment has been passed and if needed, the 27th should be proposed later on.\nWhile speaking about the economy of the country, he appreciated the positive indicators of the economy. He also suggested that Parliament should come at front foot to foil any bid against the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
