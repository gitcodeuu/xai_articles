One of its primary objectives is to ‘Enhance Educational Equity’ by ensuring that students from different regions and backgrounds are assessed fairly and consistently.\nThe framework will also play a critical role in improving teacher competencies by providing educators with the resources and training necessary to adopt SLO-based teaching methodologies.
