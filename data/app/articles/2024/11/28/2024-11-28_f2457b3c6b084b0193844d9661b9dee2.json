The department owns 1,680 passenger coaches on books out of which 72 percent of coaches have surpassed their useful life.\nThe official said the overage coaches require extra resources, and maintenance costs to keep them fit for operation. At present, 2 Up and 2 Down trains are running between Peshawar and Karachi, he added.\nHe said that two passenger trains Bolan Mail and Monjodaro Express are operating on the Larkana section to cater to the transportation needs of the area while the restoration of Khushal Khan Khattak will be examined once the availability of coaches is improved along with consideration of the operating cost and commercial viability.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
