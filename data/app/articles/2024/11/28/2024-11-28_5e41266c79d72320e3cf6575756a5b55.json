With people travelling much more frequently and far greater distances than in the past, living in more densely populated areas, and coming into closer contact with wild animals, the potential for emerging infectious diseases to spread rapidly and causes global epidemics is a major concern.\nInfections, such as zoonotic diseases, have the capacity to spread between animals and people, and in past several pathogens have emerged from animals and seriously affected human populations such as Ebola, avian influenza and corona-viruses.\nThese effects go beyond individual health and affect economies, social institutions, and global security. In fact, 75% of the emerging human infections have an animal origin.\nTo effectively treat and prevent the present and future incidence of emerging infections, a comprehensive understanding of the complex factors driving their emergence is essential. Environmental factors, such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural practices, can disrupt natural ecosystems and increase the likelihood of pathogen spillover from animals to humans.\nThe role of environmental factors as well as the genetic adaptations that enable pathogens to emerge must be thoroughly investigated to develop effective disease surveillance, outbreak control, and targeted interventions.\nAddressing the multidimensional challenges posed by these emerging pathogens requires collaborative efforts among researchers, public health agencies, veterinary professionals, environmental scientists, and policymakers.",
