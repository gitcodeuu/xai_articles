Engaging overseas Pakistanis is key to this vision, and we will collaborate with embassies and missions abroad to highlight these lucrative opportunities,” Randhawa said.\nThe initiative also includes the launch of residential plots in Sector C-14, nestled at the foothills of the Margalla Hills. Designed for a premium lifestyle, this sector is tailored to cater to both local and overseas Pakistanis, with preference given to investments made in foreign currencies such as the US dollar.\nWith these strategic moves, the CDA is setting the stage for Islamabad to emerge as a premier destination for high-end developments, offering unique opportunities for investors worldwide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
