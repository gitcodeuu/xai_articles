  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 27 (APP):Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PM&DC) has formed a seven-member committee to ensure the holding of future Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) in more transparent manner.\nThe committee is composed of members from all provinces, tasked with identifying and addressing challenges, ensuring transparency, minimizing errors, and implementing IT-based solutions.\nThis includes considerations for a centralized or university-specific test, a uniform syllabus, and the scheduling of MDCAT immediately after the intermediate exams to combat the influence of tuition mafias.\nIn this regard the inaugural meeting of the MDCAT Reform Committee was held at PMDC headquarters.\nPresident of PM&DC, Prof. Dr. Rizwan Taj, expressed his gratitude to the Chairman and the members of the committee for attending the important meeting.\nThe Chairman of the Committee Prof. Dr. Suhail Amin provided a brief update on the recent proceedings of MDCAT 2024 and its legal aspects of conducting the examination in accordance with the PM&DC Act 2022.\nThe committee was informed that a total of 167,772 candidates were registered for the 2024 exam across Pakistan, as well as in Dubai and Saudi Arabia.\nDetails regarding the performance of various examining universities, including the total percentage and highest scores, were also shared with the members.\nThe committee was updated on the retake of exams for two universities in Sindh and the Federal Government.\nFollowing the brief update, the Chairman emphasized the importance of implementing a unified syllabus for the conduct of this high-stakes examination.\nHe highlighted the need to incorporate technology to enhance the quality of the exams.\nHe acknowledged that establishing a high-tech examination system with minimal human error and increased transparency is a significant challenge.\nHe pointed out that ensuring a consistent level of difficulty across all provinces is a major hurdle. The committee must exert its best efforts to devise an effective mechanism to address this issue, he added.\nThe Chairman shared his experience interviewing successful candidates admitted to medical institutes, highlighting a significant gap between their scores and overall personality development.\nHe noted that the predictive validity of these scores is weak, emphasizing the urgent need to improve the quality of exams.\nHe acknowledged that incorporating new domains into the examination might face resistance from stakeholders, and suggested focusing on enhancing cognitive-level assessments as a practical starting point.\nThe IBCC Chairman announced the completion of the comprehensive guide for grades 9-12 outlining exam procedures and question bank development, to be implemented nationwide.\nHe supported e-examinations for MDCAT, emphasizing their practicality for MCQs, and highlighted the successful adoption of a grading system in board exams. He pledged full support for this national initiative.\nThe committee also reviewed the status of the syllabus and question bank.\nPMDC informed the committee that the MDCAT syllabus has undergone one round of revision, but further revisions are still necessary.\nThe committee also deliberated on enhancing the question bank.\nThe members discussed that developing an e-assessment system is not a particularly difficult task in the present days.\nWith proper planning and technical support, it can be effectively managed without internet-based assessments.\n“This would be a center-based examination, similar to previous practices, and we could utilize HEC-supported internet portals for enhanced security.”\nThe members of the committee deliberated that globally, all such entry tests are designed to assess a candidate’s potential as a health professional.\n“We must consider incorporating more content that tests higher cognitive abilities, critical thinking, and ethical and contextual domains.”\nHe noted that the current practice primarily involves retesting previously covered content, which does not adequately justify the significant efforts invested in this high-stakes examination for a specialized profession.\nPresident of PMDC, Prof. Dr. Rizwan Taj, endorsed all the points discussed and informed the members that he had attended several meetings at the Senate and National Assembly on the same issue.\nHe emphasized that PMDC must submit an Action Plan for the reforms of the MDCAT examination by December 2024.\nHe added that in response to recent issues regarding the MDCAT examination, it is imperative to address concerns and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to ensure a fair and transparent examination process across Pakistan.\nHe emphasized the need for MDCAT to remain free from controversy and upheld as a standard of integrity.\nHe expressed regret over the misconduct that occurred in the recent MDCAT exam despite extensive efforts to uphold fairness.\nHe said, “We are deeply concerned about the harm caused by unscrupulous elements who have tarnished the image of the entire system in this national exercise.”\nHe expressed the hope that the reform committee will devise a robust and transparent system to restore public trust and maintain the credibility of this crucial examination.\n“We will try our best to prevent such occurrences and take comprehensive steps to ensure long-term sustainability and accountability in the examination system.”\nHe said that the meeting concluded with the identification of three main categories included Content, Conduct, and Policy.\nThe Chairman formally assigned future tasks and established three sub-committees with deadlines for further work to streamline the reform process.\nThe first sub-committee, the MDCAT Syllabus Committee, is comprised of four members and will draft a unified syllabus with consensus from local and foreign boards.\nThey will develop a Table of Specifications for the exam and create an outline with a plan for building a sustainable question bank.\nThe second sub-committee, the E-Assessment Project Committee, is comprised of three members who were given task of proposing a secure question bank portal and e-assessment plan, along with technical specifications and cost estimates.\nThey will also draft a working paper on the modalities for conducting centralized e-MDCAT.\nThe third sub-committee, the MDCAT Policy Document Committee, is comprised of two members who will work on developing a comprehensive policy document for the smooth implementation of the national exam.\nThe Chairman directed all sub-committees to submit their drafts by December. The draft action plan will be reviewed in its upcoming meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
