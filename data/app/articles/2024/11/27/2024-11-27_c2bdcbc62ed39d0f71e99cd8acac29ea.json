Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five is essential to provide children high immunity against this devastating disease.\nThe Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the oral polio vaccine to children at their doorsteps.\nThe Expanded Programme on Immunization provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities.\nIt is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected and help make Pakistan polio-free.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
