The management of Polyclinic Hospital had issued a statement denying claims of dead bodies shifted there.\nHe said that PTI was the only political party which always made bogus claims of killing of its workers. He said last night he personally visited the area from D-Chowk to 7th Avenue but saw nothing which could prove PTI claims of firing on its workers.\nHe remarked that the PTI leadership had run away from the scene to escape arrest and now they were creating narrative of killings of protestors.\nHe said if the PTI had proofs of killing of their workers, then they should present post mortem reports and other evidences.\nHe said 37 Afghan nationals and dozens of criminals involved in terrorism, theft and robberies were arrested from the PTI protest scene.\nHe said contrary to its claims of playing victim card,  the violent PTI workers killed four Rangers and two police personnel and 150 cops were injured.\nHe questioned as to what justification would the PTI give for use of weapons, firing of tear gas shells and slingshots by unruly mob.\nHe said that 45 guns and grenades were recovered from the miscreants belonging to the PTI.\nHe contended that it was preplanned conspiracy to cancel the visit of Belarus President and sabotage the peace of the capital and damage national economy.\nTarar said that the PTI leadership was so inefficient and weak that they could not arrange a sit in without backing of the establishment.\nHe remarked that 126 days’ sit in of 2014 was also staged with the backing of certain elements in the establishment.\nCastigating Bushra Bibi, he said she wanted dead bodies to get political advantage while Ali Amin Gandapur escaped to avoid the arrest.\nHe was of the opinion that political movements could not be run like this and PTI’s political ideology had flopped now.\nHe said the PTI had the habit of concocting stories and it claimed that Rangers were killed by law enforcement agencies, but CCTV footage proved them wrong and now the culprits had been arrested from Abbottabad.\nHe said senior leaders of the PTI Atif Khan, Shehrsm Tarakai, Asad Qaiser, Salman Akram Raja, Hamad Azhar and Waqas Akram stayed away from entire protest.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
