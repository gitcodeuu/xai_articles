  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 26 (APP): Minister for Information, Broadcasting, National Heritage and Culture Attaullah Tarar on Tuesday said the protestors of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) have used the “modern firearms” during their protest that had claimed lives of a few rangers and police personnel and inflicted injuries to the many.\nThe minister shared some footages to this end during his talk to the media.\n“I want to share the visual evidence of the PTI’s violence at the express highway which were not in the public eye before,” he said while pointing out to the modern weapons including tear gas guns and shells in the video.\nHe showed to the nation the shells and cartridges used by the miscreants during the protest which he said the government had pushed away from the D-Chowk.\n“My question is whether this tear gas gun or shell is available in the market; and how the PTI workers get the latest weapons including tear gas guns, shells and grenades,” he said, adding the KP government’s funds must be used for this purpose.\nHe vowed the strict action against those, who were seen in videos using the modern firearms while covering their faces, in accordance with the law.\nTarar asked whether the protestors are allowed to bring the weapons in a peaceful protest. “Are the so called human rights’ defenders unable to see the use of weapons by the PTI protestors in the protest which claimed lives of a few Rangers and Police personnel and inflicted injuries on many.”\n“Whether the KP government provided these modern weapons,” he questioned.\nHe said the police had not opened any fire on protestors, but ironically the PTI is creating false narratives on social media to play victim.\nThe minister said the talks with the “terrorists” were out of question, adding zero tolerance against those who would take the law in their own hands.",
