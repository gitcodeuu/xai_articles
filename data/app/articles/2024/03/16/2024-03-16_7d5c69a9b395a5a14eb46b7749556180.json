Hence the situation demands that the Government should start deliberations with the business leaders, and incorporate their suggestions in the budget document to ease their problems which in turn will benefit the masses, he said.\nHe expressed the hope that the sitting government as per its election manifesto will pay heed to the issue on a priority basis and formulate long-term policies in the best interest of the business community and ultimately the common man.\nThe President ICCI added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is a visionary leader and is well aware of the difficulties of the entrepreneurs as well as the masses, so he will surely direct his economic team to start consultations with the business leaders to achieve this cherished goal.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
