He said that the youth must be kept abreast of positive and negative aspects of novel technologies.\nThe Chairman urged all the universities to play their role in raising awareness, mobilising resources, and taking corrective measures in curbing the menace of blasphemy on social media.\nHe underlined the needs for holding awareness sessions as a regular feature on digital literacy and responsible online behaviour, in addition to arranging discussions on the consequences of hate speech and blasphemy.\nHe observed that Pakistani youth have a great potential that needs to be tapped by making them understand the true perspectives of complex issues with logic and rationale.\nApprising the audience of the gravity of situation, Rao Abdur Rahim made a shocking revelation that 400,000 social media accounts have recently been involved in sacrilegious activities.\nThe more concerning point, he added, is that 160 out of 300 people arrested by FIA Cyber Crime Wing on charges of blasphemous activities, are  students or graduates. He cautioned that the enemies of Pakistan have joined their hands to create law and order situation in Pakistan to fulfill their nefarious designs.\n“To deal with the threat, there is a dire need for strong awareness efforts to sensitise the masses about the sacredness of holy figures, books, and religious matters. The state’s intervention and role is must for prevention of the misuse of social media,” he said.\nIn his remarks, Dr. Zia Ul Haque highlighted the role of academia and parents for prevention of the abuse of ICT tools and applications. He said Pakistan is the contemporary version of the State of Medina as the country was founded in the name of Islam.\nHe said the life of the Last Prophet (PBUH) is a role model for the Muslims and his Seerah is the strength based on which Pakistan can be given its due status.\nHe said that teachers, parents, and religious, social and political leaders are duty-bound to tell the youth that Islam, the Last Prophet (PBUH), Pakistan and its institutions, and the institution of family are the redlines in the freedom they enjoy in the independent Pakistan.\nIt is worth mentioning here that the HEC seminar is a sequel of the Action Plan prepared by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony in consultation with various stakeholders to curb the misuse of social media and prevent blasphemous material/activities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
