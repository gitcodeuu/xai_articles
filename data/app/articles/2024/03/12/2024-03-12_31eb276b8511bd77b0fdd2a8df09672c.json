Associated with tales of Mahmud of Ghazna’s son Masud and the valiant Ghakhar Chief Sarang Khan, the fortress holds a rich tapestry of narratives within its walls.\nPresently, the Fort exhibits two gateways on its northern and eastern sides, a three-domed Mosque in the Western Wing’s heart, and an octagonal single-domed Mausoleum in the North-Western corner. Scattered graves within its precinct tell tales of bygone eras.\nThe majestic rows of identical living cells line the quadrangular inner face of the defense walls, overlooking the courtyard, showcasing the fort’s historical architectural marvels.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
