He also urged the bank staff to ensure transparency in the payment process.\nThe beneficiaries are also advised to receive their full payment through the agent/representative of their nearest designated bank and contact the toll-free number 080026477 or the nearest Tehsil offices in case of any deduction.\nBesides Benazir Kafaalat stipend payments, the disbursement of education stipends is also being carried out across the country. In some areas, the special Ramzan grant is also being issued to the beneficiaries.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the special control room has been activated in the BISP headquarters to address the complaints of the beneficiaries promptly.\nHowever, the beneficiaries can also contact them on WhatsApp numbers including 03018472836/03028240958 (Sindh), 0318472831 (South Punjab-I), 03175370095 (South Punjab-II), 03028240972 (Central Punjab), 03028240977 (North Punjab), 03185761507 (Balochistan), 03175370081 (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), 03155213394 (Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan).\nThe messages from the Benazir Income Support Program are sent only from 8171, and messages from any other number should not be trusted. The officials of BISP have been directed to ensure the smooth disbursement of Kafaalat payments to the women respectively without any deductions.\nThe staff has been deputed to monitor the process of payment disbursement and take immediate action against the agents responsible for deductions from the beneficiary’s payments.\nThe payment process is going on smoothly across the country through two designated banks including HBL and Alfalah.\nWhile work on initiating payments through ATMs is under process and will be completed soon. The beneficiaries will be able to get their payments through ATMs by the end of this month.\nThe BISP is currently supporting 9.3 million deserving families and acting as a lifeline for those facing economic hardship.\nThe Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) program, also known as the “Benazir Kafaalat Programme,” is the core initiative of BISP and was launched in 2008. Since its inception, the UCT/Kafaalat initiative has grown to the extent that it is now the largest single cash transfer program in Pakistan’s history.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
