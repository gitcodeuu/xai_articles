  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 11 (APP): Ufone 4G & Huawei won the GSMA GLOMO award for the category ‘Best Mobile Innovation for Emerging Markets’ at the Mobile World Congress for the ground breaking solution of the Microwave Super-Hub.\nThe global first-ever trial and commercial deployment of the Super-Hub feature was done in the Ufone network during Q4 2023 enhancing the spectral efficiency of the microwave spectrum, said a news release.\nThe microwave spectrum, a critical asset in today’s digital landscape, demands efficient utilization to meet the ever-growing demands of wireless technologies, as the challenges facing microwave back-haul networks have intensified, particularly in emerging markets such as developing countries with lesser optical fibre footprints.\nIn response to these challenges, Huawei and Ufone 4G joined forces & unveiled the ground-breaking Super-Hub solution. Designed to overcome the hurdles posed by limited spectrum resources, spatial constraints and frequency acquisition difficulties, Super-Hub has enabled Ufone to maximize microwave spectrum reuse with unprecedented efficiency.\nThis was made possible by the reuse of the same microwave frequency channel across multiple links at aggregation sites with a spatial separation as low as 20 degrees. Ufone recorded a remarkable 50% spectrum saving without any compromise on quality.\nJafar Khalid, Group Chief Technology and Information Officer, PTCL & Ufone 4G commented, “We are delighted that Global Mobile (GLOMO) Awards, which are the industry’s most prestigious accolade with over 200 independent judges and 30 awards across 6 categories, have recognized the joint contributions of Ufone and Huawei in finding an innovative solution to optimizing microwave spectral efficiency, enhancing capacity and reducing interference.\nThis advancement in global back-haul connectivity represents a paradigm shift in how terrestrial microwave networks will be built in future, and we are proud to be the front-runner in this journey”.\nJames Zeng, Global President of Huawei Microwave Product Line, explained, “With increasing demands on existing network infrastructure, systemic optimizations are critical to improve performance and experience. Our Super-Hub solution innovation uses existing frequencies to greatly boost bandwidth, enhance user experience, and optimize the TCO for operators.\nWe are confident that this technology breakthrough will help Ufone release more capacity from their existing spectrum resources and also pave the way for future dense network deployments and evolution”. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, Huawei and Ufone 4G remain committed to driving innovation and empowering networks with cutting-edge solutions that address the most pressing challenges in the telecommunications industry.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
