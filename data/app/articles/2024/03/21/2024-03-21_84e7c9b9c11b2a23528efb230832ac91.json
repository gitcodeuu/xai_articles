Youth can make a tangible impact by planting trees themselves,” he added.\nEarly detection and rapid response systems can only play a crucial role in monitoring and surveillance, enabling timely action, he said, adding, we are collaborating with universities and introducing technologies to control the incidents.\nData analysis is also vital component of wildfire detection and monitoring, he said, adding, it involves processing and interpreting data collected from various sources.\nProtecting and restoring forests as a vast carbon sink is essential for mitigating climate change, he said, adding,  therefore, we call for an urgent protection of these vulnerable ecosystems and their wildlife, including a forest landscape restoration and a sustainable agriculture development.\nFurther, agricultural projects in rainforests with indigenous peoples should be promoted since agriculture is the main cause of deforestation, he added.\nHe said that the government would ensure that the country’s crucial forest ecosystems are protected as they are the lifeline of livelihood and environmental well-being of the nation.\nReplying a question, he said that the day serves as reminder of the vital role that forests play in our daily lives as these are home to all forms of wildlife and provide sustenance to communities across the world.\nThe day calls upon youth, citizens, governments, NGOs, other local, national and international organisations to undertake activities involving forests and trees, such as tree planting campaigns and protect forests from destruction.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
