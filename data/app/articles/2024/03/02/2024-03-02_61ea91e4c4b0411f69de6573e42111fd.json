He said Muslims must organize prayers for the entire community because whether in Gaza or anywhere else, Muslims are undergoing misery and unimaginable pain.\n“We have left the ways of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). That is the primary reason, why our pain seems to have no end,” he said.\nHe acknowledged the patience, Kashmiris have to exercise. “I hail your steadfastness and patience. Allah will reward you for it,” Sheikh Ashraf Effendi told the gathering.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
