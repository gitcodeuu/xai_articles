There are so many sites in the province which if opened for international tourists will be visited by a large number of people besides attracting foreign investment, the meeting noted.\nIqbal Sarwar observed that there are countless places in the province which are still not visited by tourists and If local and international investors are encouraged to make profitable investments these sites can become the best tourist destinations.\nThe establishment of more new tourist destinations in the province will also create new hotels, restaurants, rest houses, and other facilities, and the associated job opportunities for tour guides, travel agents, and tour operators, Sarwar noted.\nPresident of the Overseas Pakistani Community in Belgium, Muazzamur Rehman, while appreciating the holding of the meeting said the briefing is an expression of positive and effective planning and constructive thinking in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
