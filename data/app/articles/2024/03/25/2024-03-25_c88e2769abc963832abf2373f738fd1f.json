He also added, “The problem of Jammu and Kashmir is not just about the territory, peace, and security; it is, first and foremost, about the people and their unmet aspirations to determine their political future.”\nThe Speaker also sought the attention of participants to the worst challenge of global Climate Change being faced by developing countries.\n“Pakistan’s contribution to the global carbon footprint is quite less than 1 percent, even then Pakistan remains the frontline state to bear the brunt of climate change as in 2022, Pakistan suffered one of the worst floods of its history which left one-third of the country inundated.”\nHe also said that it was high time for taking international action to deal with the effects of climate change and galvanize it, especially in the most vulnerable countries.\nWhile reiterating his pledge as parliamentarians, he said that they need to deepen their understanding of a new era of technological progress and what it means for their work and the people they represent.",
