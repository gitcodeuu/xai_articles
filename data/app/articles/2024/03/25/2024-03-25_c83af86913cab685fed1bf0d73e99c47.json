A number of selected high-level influential and decision-making candidates from affected African countries will visit Pakistan to learn from vast experience of Pakistan and fostering of partnerships to collaborate in research, surveillance and control for mutual benefit,” the DoMC official said.\nHe underlined that this visit would be an initial pilot event as a foundation to build on future exchanges with expanded objectives and outputs, but critical to set an example and initiate partnerships, importantly also to demonstrate successful outputs and outcomes that can serve as incentive for funding partners to support future initiatives for multi-country efforts to curb the Anopheles stephensi threat.\nHowever, the Directorate of Malaria Control (DoMC) and Department of Entomology Arid University (at National Entomological Reference Laboratory) was also going to hold a week long international training course for Molecular Mosquito Identification through PCR in May, 2024.\nThe official mentioned that the Directorate had received very impressive CVs from young and energetic entomologists from the country. However, it was only needed to enhance their capacity and involvement in vector surveillance and control.\n“We are at the final stage of finalization of four most suitable candidates from the participants. Since there is very neck-to-neck competition among them, therefore we are also trying to increase 2-3 more candidates from Pakistan through local funding sources. INSHALLAH the selected ones will be the PIONEERS who will receive this International training in Pakistan and will also be most suitable candidates for more advance course abroad in near future,” he added.\nHe added that the aspiring candidates have been advised that since the programme would run through PCR and DNA extraction of different species of mosquitoes and would preserve them as representative samples from Pakistan, therefore the Directorate needed a very strong commitment from them for collection and sending samples of mosquitoes from their selected areas.\nThe candidates have been urged to start their assignment for collection and sending mosquitoes from their areas (regardless the identification), he said, adding, “During course they will be trained for identification (both morphologically and through PCR). Just due to this commitment we need those committed and energetic candidates who are and will continue their work in vector control and surveillance their department”.\n/395",
