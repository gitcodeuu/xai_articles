These challenges are not just obstacles; they are injustices that must be addressed with urgency and determination,” she remarked.\nShe highlighted that Pakistan, as a member state of the United Nations, fully endorsed the Charter of the United Nations which strived to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination of gender.\nThe constitution of Pakistan also ensured fundamental rights and provided ample guarantees to women against all forms of discrimination, exploitation and marginalization, in addition to the right to equality, to grow and lead a healthy and prosperous life, she said.\nSamina Alvi also stressed on girls’ education to make the country’s women strong enough to face the challenges of life with the strength of their minds.\nBesides, she also stressed the need to make continuous efforts to equip our women with vocational skills to utilize their potential and also to save them from economic exploitation.\nBy using digital platforms, she said the women could overcome many of the barriers they might encounter in traditional job pursuits.\n“We need to work towards increasing access to digital resources, providing education and training in technology, and building supportive environments that enable women to excel in tech-related fields,” she said adding this included initiatives such as mentorship programs, scholarships, and providing digital technologies.\n“This, in turn, will promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in Pakistan by providing an enabling environment for women to enter the workforce and contribute to national development,” she added.\nHighlighting her key area of focus on raising awareness about breast cancer, Samina Alvi said she had been advocating for better access to screening and treatment services for women across Pakistan.\n“Breast cancer is not just a health issue; it is a social justice issue. Every woman, regardless of her socioeconomic status deserves the right to quality healthcare and the opportunity to live a healthy life,” she added.\nSimilarly, she said she had been deeply committed to promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities.\nEarlier panelists, Dr. Sania Nishtar, Azima Dhanjee and Dr. Maha Noor Khan discussed in detail about the role of women in a progressive society.",
