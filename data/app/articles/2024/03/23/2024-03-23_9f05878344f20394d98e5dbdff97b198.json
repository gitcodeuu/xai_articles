We are ready to share our expertise with the global community,” he added. He said Pakistan was emitting less than one percent of the global carbon emissions but was among the 10 most climate vulnerable countries in the world.\nPakistan was devastated by the worst floods of its history in the recent past and the federal government in collaboration with the provinces spent Rs 100 billion on the relief and rehabilitation of flood-affected people.\nHe said on the sidelines of the nuclear energy summit, he held bilateral meetings with the foreign ministers of Turkey, Azerbaijan, UAE and the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nDuring meetings with the foreign ministers of Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, they agreed to enhance cooperation in areas of trade, investment, defence and economy. During meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister, “we agreed to enhance our bilateral trade volume”.\nThe minister said he had a productive meeting with the Director General of IAEA who had visited Pakistan at the inauguration of C5 nuclear power project. He said during his meeting with the Foreign Minister of UAE, they agreed to enhance cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.\nHe also held a substantive meeting with the Chinese Vice President and exchanged views on diverse areas of cooperation and he agreed to visit Pakistan in the future, he added. China was all weather friend of Pakistan who supported Pakistan on all issues and at international forums, he remarked.\nHe also told about his meetings with ministers of the United Kingdom, during which it was agreed that UK government would further invest in development projects in Pakistan.  He expressed best wishes for King Charles and Princess of Wales who were diagnosed with cancer.\nTo a question about Congressional hearings in the United States about matters related to Pakistan, he urged that Pakistanis should leave behind politics when they were outside the country and get united.\nTo a question about elections, Ishaq Dar said, “We have comprehensive constitutional and legal cover for elections”, adding different parties got the mandate of the people and it should be accepted.” Legal forums were available to address the election-related complaints and a person could approach Election Commission, election tribunals and higher judiciary, he noted. He said Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had agreed to work with the federal government which was a positive development.\nHe recalled Pakistan had suffered a lot due to policy failures, adding due to the successful policies of the last government of Nawaz Sharif inflation came down, economy grew, and the international financial institutions acknowledged the economic achievements of Pakistan. The minister said after attack on the Army Public School, a national action plan was devised and it was decided not to allow use of Pakistani territory against any other country.\nHe said the leadership in Afghanistan should condemn the terrorist attacks in Pakistan which were carried out by the Tehreek i Taliban Pakistan based in Afghanistan. “We carried out an intelligence-based anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan against the terror group,” he told.\nHe said neighbouring countries should eliminate terrorism through mutual cooperation. Responding to a question, he said Pakistan needed to get out of the trap of budget deficit and current account deficit.\nHe said economic diplomacy was top priority of the government and the new finance minister Muhammad Aurganbzeb had all the expertise to deal with economic issues of Pakistan.\nThe minister said the government was trying its best for the resumption of flights of Pakistan International Airlines after meeting all the international requirements for compliance. “We are keen for the resumption of PIA flights and it is a matter of weeks after which flights will be initiated.”\nHe said relations between Pakistan and India faced a setback after India revoked the constitutional and legal status of Jammu and Kashmir in August, 2019. “We will seriously look into matters of trade with Pakistan,” he added. He said he would also look into the complaints of closure of social media platform X in Pakistan.",
