He said that the agreements will further strengthen the mutual economic and trade relations along with promoting the bilateral business between the two countries.\nDr. Reza Amiri Moghadam made these remarks during his visit to the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) at the invitation of President ICCI, Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawri here on Thursday.\nThe Iranian ambassador said that the current bilateral trade volume between Pakistan and Iran is $2.5 billion, which has increased by 11 percent in the last 11 months.\nHe said that after the FTA and bilateral agreements between the two governments for the promotion of mutual trade, there is a strong possibility of doubling the mutual trade between Pakistan and Iran to reach $5 billion in the next few years.\nHe said that the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline is a huge facility for the people of Pakistan on behalf of the government of Iran, which will benefit both the domestic and industrial sectors of Pakistan.\nHe said that Iran completed its section of the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline in 2009 at a cost of $1 billion, bringing it to Pakistan’s border to help resolve the country’s energy problems. Iranian Envoy said that Iran is already trading with Turkey, Turkmenistan, Iran and Azerbaijan in the sector of energy and gas and Pakistan can also adopt the procedure adopted with these countries.\nDr. Reza Amiri said that Iran has a banking channel with Turkey, Bahrain, and Iraq, and Pakistan can follow this procedure.\nHe said that Pakistan and Iran need to have strong air, maritime, and sea links, which will strengthen the economic relations between the two countries. He said Pakistan will also be connected to regional and global trade with these connections.\nThe Ambassador emphasized the closeness of maritime links between the two countries, especially Karachi and Gwadar and Chabahar and Bandar Abbas ports. He said that Gwadar and Chabahar should be declared as sister ports.\nHe said that it is the era of trade links and at this time both countries need to connect with regional and global trade through these ports.\nHe said that the Pakistan-China Trade Corridor and BRI projects also have strong prospects for economic and trade integration.\nHe said that the world is currently being connected and both countries can make their place in the global trade market by connecting to the North-South and East-West trade corridors.
