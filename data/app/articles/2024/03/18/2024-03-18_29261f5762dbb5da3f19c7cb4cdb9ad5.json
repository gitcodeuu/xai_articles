The court said that the cantonment board could collect tax till next date under act of 1958 and adjourned the case till April 22.\nA five member bench headed by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah heard the appeal of Attorney General of Pakistan against the verdict of SHC into the matter.\nThe AGP argued that a presidential ordinance was promulgated in 1979 on property tax law of 1958. The ordinance was given constitutional protection in 1985 through the 8th amendment.\nHe said that the tax collection by the cantonment board was a federal subject.
