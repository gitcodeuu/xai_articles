  "content": "LAHORE, Mar 20 (APP):The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday suspended a notice, issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to a successful candidate on a petition against vote recount in the NA-133 constituency.\nJustice Shams Mehmood Mirza heard the petition, filed by Azimuddin Zahid of the Sunni Ittehad Council, challenging recounting of votes. The court also issued notices to the ECP and other respondents regarding the petition.\nDuring the proceedings, the petitioner’s counsel argued that his client won from NA-133 constituency with a lead of 10,757 votes. He submitted that the returning officer and Election Commission not only issued a notification for the petitioner’s success but also rejected a request for recounting votes of the defeated candidate, Rana Muhammad Ishaq.\nHe further submitted that now appellate tribunals had been formed for hearing electoral grievances, but the Election Commission issued a notice to his client on an application filed for vote recount by the defeated candidate. He argued that the notice was issued in violation of the law and requested that it be declared null and void.\nIn response, the court suspended the notice and sought a reply from the Election Commission and others involved.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
