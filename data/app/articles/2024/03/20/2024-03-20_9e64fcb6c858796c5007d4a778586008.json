He said the HEC’s regulatory role will continue to keep the operations streamlined.\nHe also elaborated the measures to improve HEC operations keeping in view that the sector has expanded with 262 universities operating in the country.\nThe Chair of the Vice Chancellors’ Committee, Dr. Iqrar Ahmad Khan thanked HEC on behalf of the VCs for assembling the university heads from the public and private sector HEIs, for deliberation and solution of the key issues.\nHe said the VCs stand by HEC for revival of the HEC Ordinance and resolution of the critical challenges, such as financial crisis in universities, human resource management in universities including the appointment of faculty on Basic Pay Scale and Tenure Track System; search committee for appointment of Vice Chancellors; University Acts; affiliation of degree awarding institutions; MOOCs and online education; internationalisation of universities; quality of PhDs; and formulation of student representation platforms.\nExpressing their views, the Vice Chancellors of different public and private sector universities demanded of the Provincial Governments to make significant financial contribution to the operations of universities in their respective provinces, urging the Federal Government to continue supporting the provincial universities alongside the federal universities.\nThe opening ceremony was followed by panel discussions on Quality Assurance, Research & Innovation, Finance, Accreditation and Attestation, and Information Technology & Connectivity.\nHEC officials shared presentations on these themes to seek input from the participating Vice Chancellors.\nThe panelists expressed their views about various policies and regulations, which were noted for further deliberation and incorporation.\nDuring the second day, each session chair will present recommendations and the same will be discussed by the forum for finalisation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
