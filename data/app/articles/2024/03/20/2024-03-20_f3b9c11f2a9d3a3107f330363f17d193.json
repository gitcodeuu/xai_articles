He revealed a significant revenue increase from Rs 5 billion to Rs 8 billion in recent months.\nBaloch emphasized the role of coal transportation in meeting almost 50 per cent of railway expenses and underscored the need for continuous efforts to operate the railway system effectively. He acknowledged former Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique’s contributions to improving the railway, including track restoration and the revival of profitable trains.\nAddressing challenges, Baloch mentioned the burden of pension expenses on the railway, urging the government to take responsibility for the pension to alleviate financial strain.
