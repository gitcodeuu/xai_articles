Integrating epidemiology and climate information helps understand and manage diseases sensitive to climate.\nEarly-warning systems help to reduce poverty by giving people the chance to prepare and limit the impact of extreme weather.\nWMO, its Members, and its partners drive the full value cycle, from science to services to action for the good of society. It advances knowledge of our Earth system, monitors the state of the climate and water resources, provides scientific information to inform greenhouse gas emissions reductions and delivers climate services and early warnings to support climate adaptation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
