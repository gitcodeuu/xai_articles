They argued that opening these natural routes would facilitate and make greater progress for the traders.\nA Kashmiri historian emphasized on the shorter routes including Muzaffarabad. The historian said that utilizing shorter trade routes to supply locally produced items to South Asia, would help increase business activity in the area.\nFruit growers from the valley, particularly from areas like Shopian and Sopur, are facing challenges in transporting their products to New Delhi due to obstacles on the Jammu Kashmir National Highway, leading to significant losses.\nDespite pressure to rely on Delhi’s tourism, Kashmiris assert their diverse trading history and resilience, affirming their ability to thrive without dependence on external sources. This sentiment underscores the importance of preserving Kashmir’s cultural and economic heritage amidst external pressures.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
