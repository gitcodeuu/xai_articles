However, the bright morning with ample sunshine today not only ended the hazed and rainy atmosphere but also restored the joy of the people who were fed up with sitting behind closed doors in front of heaters” Shaista Nazir, a government employee said.\n“After a long time, I enjoyed sitting on the rooftop of my office and had peanuts and oranges with my colleagues under the open sky and sunshine”, she said while talking to APP.\nImran Sadiq, who is associated with the profession of teaching, said, it was very hard to bear the very cold weather conditions for my old father who is in his late 80’s.\n“Today he could get exposure to the sun after so many days as earlier the sun couldn’t shine properly due to the rainy and cloudy weather”, he said.\nMany of the parents were not allowing their children to go outside assuming that they would get sick due to chilly weather while the children were also not happy being restricted within their homes.\nTaking advantage of the sunny weather, the families planned to take their children to the nearby parks for outing on Monday.\nAccording to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), continental air was prevailing over most parts of the country.
