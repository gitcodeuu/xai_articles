Dr Guha Pradeepa, co-author of the study, declared obesity a serious global problem.\n“Climate change, disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and increased poverty and rising food prices are exacerbating rates of both obesity and underweight,” he said.\nWorld Obesity Prevention Day serves as a reminder of the pressing need for concerted efforts to combat obesity and promote healthier lifestyles worldwide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
