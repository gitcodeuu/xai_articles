Let us work for a Pakistan that is not driven apart by differences but is united around shared values,” he urged.\nThe prime minister said that the 23rd March marked a momentous day in the history as on that day in 1940 the Muslims of Sub-Continent passed the historic ‘Lahore Resolution’ and demanded a separate homeland where they could freely live their own way of life according to the principles of Islam.\nThrough a consistent and dedicated political struggle of our founding fathers, the dream of a separate homeland for Muslims of South Asia became a reality and Pakistan appeared on the map of the world on 14th August 1947, he added.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz said that the forefathers made untiring efforts and rendered exemplary sacrifices for Pakistan and  millions of Muslims left their homes in India and decided to migrate to Pakistan.\nThe new state had faced unprecedented challenges including creating a social and economic foundation, settlement of refugees, creation of state institutions, and meagre resources.\nHowever, the prime minister said that under the inspiring leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and with the resilience and dedication of the nation, those daunting challenges faced by the nascent state were addressed and a foundation for an independent democratic state was laid down.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
