Applicants are advised that the process operates on a first-come, first-served basis, emphasizing the importance of prompt submission.\nProspective participants are required to obtain an application form from the Faisal Masjid Islamic Centre office, accompanied by a non-refundable fee of Rs. 5,000. Alongside the application, individuals must provide two passport-sized photographs and a copy of their national identity card, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order.\nWith the responsibility of Suhoor and Iftar arrangements falling upon the participants, individuals are urged to prepare accordingly for the duration of their Aitekaf.\nIt’s worth noting that the opportunity for Aitekaf is open to individuals up to 60 years of age, fostering inclusivity within the spiritual community. Moreover, participants are reminded of the necessity to arrive before Iftar on the 20th of Ramazan, marking the commencement of their seclusion.\nIn anticipation of this sacred undertaking, Faisal Masjid has made special arrangements to accommodate the devotees embarking on this spiritual journey.
