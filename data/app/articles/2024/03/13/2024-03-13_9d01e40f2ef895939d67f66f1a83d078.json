Strategies and steps are being taken for revival of the economy,” Tarar maintained.\nThe minister said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was working day and night for the improvement of the economy and daily he chaired three to four meetings on the economy only. He said that the prime minister was working to end inflation and unemployment in the country.\nThe minister said on the other hand there was a political party which did not see anything beyond itself, and it did not care about the national interests or integrity of Pakistan.\nHe said Pakistan could earn precious foreign exchange if GSP plus status from EU continued, it would help create more job opportunities and strengthen rupee as a currency.\n“If Pakistan has GSP plus status, foreign exchange will come, our exports will increase, rupee will become stable, inflation will be reduced and employment opportunities will be provided”, Ataullah Tarar remarked.\nAt the start of his press conference he assured that he would try his best to take measures for the welfare of media workers and journalists. “The doors of the Ministry of Information are opened for journalists and will try to play the role of a bridge between the government and the media,” he added.\nHe said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had started working on a strategy to deal with the challenges faced by the economy as soon as he assumed office.\nHe said it was an honour that yesterday, Bloomberg magazine mentioned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif regarding his potential for betterment of Pakistan’s economy.\nThe minister said that Bloomberg also termed the choice of Muhammad Aurangzeb as finance minister as the best choice who as an economist had vast experience at global level. Tarar said that Bloomberg also mentioned the policies of the Prime Minister for revival of the economy.\nReplying to a question, he said that these elements were contacting the European Union and asking them to withdraw the GSP plus status, which was tantamount to a conspiracy and nefarious attempt to make the poor people of Pakistan suffer.\nTo another question, he said Imran Khan was living a lavish life in jail, adding the founder of PTI had been given not only a room but the entire gallery for walk.\nAccording to the prison manual of 1978, every prisoner was allowed one meeting in a week, but the founder chairman PTI was allowed four meetings in a week, he added.\nThe minister said one meeting was held with lawyers, one with friends, one meeting with political associates and one meeting with family members. Since Imran Khan had been in prison, he had met hundreds of people,the minister informed. Besides, he said, Imran was given exercise equipment in jail.\nAbout PTI, he said, these were the people who attacked and destroyed the memorials of the martyrs on May 9 and ransacked the residence of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Lahore.\nHe said the PTI had hatched a cipher conspiracy and tried to spoil Pakistan’s relations globally. Now attempts were being made to put the country’s economy at stake through a campaign based on lies, he remarked.\nTo a question, he said that meetings banned on reports of sabotage near Adiala Jail and security audit of Adial, Mianwali and DG Khan jails was being done.\nThe minister said that the facilities available to PTI founder chairman in jail had not been provided to any other politician till date. In view of the fear of sabotage inside some jails, the letter was issued by the Punjab government for temporary ban on meetings.\nThe minister said conducting the security audit was the responsibility of the Punjab government and it was the responsibility of the prison authorities and the concerned government to ensure the security of all prisoners, including Imran Khan.\nHe said Adiala Jail was an attached department of Punjab Home Department and all rules and regulations were listed in the jail manual. Tarar said that the PTI was conspiring against Pakistan by giving a false narrative to the EU and it had attacked Pakistan’s GSP Plus status by using the excuse of providing facilities to the founder chairman of the party.",
