  "content": "LAHORE, Mar 03 (APP):The National Transmission and Despatch Company Limited (NTDC) teams have successfully installed/added 160 MVA 220/132kV auto-transformer (T-4), make Jiangsu Huepang China, along with complete 220 kV Dia at 220 kV  grid station at Daud Khel. The said 160 MVA auto-transformer has been energised, the company’s spokesman disclosed this to the media on Sunday.\nHe added that in its commitment to ensure smooth power supply, the NTDC has achieved a significant milestone by enhancing the capacity of its transmission network through the System Constraints Removal Programme.\nHe said that this is the 3rd auto-transformer installed during a span of one month. Earlier initiatives involved the replacement and augmentation of two auto-transformers at the Ghakkar and Okara grid stations. At the Ghakkar station, a 160 MVA auto-transformer was replaced with a 250 MVA, 220/132 kV unit, while a new 160 MVA 220/132kV auto-transformer (T-3) was installed at the Okara grid station. These efforts have collectively added 570 MVA to the transmission capacity.\nThese projects have been completed under National Transmission Modernization Project (NTMP-I), funded by the World Bank. This augmentation is poised to enhance the grid stations’ capacity, catering to the growing demand from regions served by GEPCO, LESCO, PESCO, and FESCO. The increased capacity not only benefits industrial, agricultural, and domestic consumers but also improves the system reliability.\nThe NTDC Managing Director Engr. Dr. Rana Abdul Jabbar Khan appreciated the Project Delivery (North) teams for their dedication and successful execution of these projects.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
