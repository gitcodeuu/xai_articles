  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 14 (APP): Former prime minister and senior leader of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Central Punjab, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on Saturday, criticized the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership, calling them the enemy of Pakistan’s interests, democracy, parliament, constitution, and peace.\nSpeaking on the floor of the National Assembly, he said, “The leadership of PTI is an enemy of consensus, Pakistan, peace, and the interests of the people, as well as democracy, parliament, and the constitution.”\nHe said that while the committee established by the National Assembly Speaker aims to improve the parliamentary atmosphere, the PTI leadership appears to have a different agenda.\nHe also referenced PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s question regarding a controversial tweet, saying that the individual behind it opposes peace, democracy, and the supremacy of the parliament, desiring chaos in the country.\n“No patriot would post such a tweet or humiliate the institutions of the country,” Ashraf said, emphasizing that no one should make national institutions or their leaders controversial.\nHe stressed that the country’s well-being is more important than any political party.\nHe highlighted the contributions of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s grandfather, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who granted Pakistan the right to vote and a constitution.\nIn contrast, he criticized the grandfather of the opposition leader for laying the foundation of dictatorship in the country.\nHe recalled that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto refused to bow down and sacrificed his life for democracy, the constitution, and the people.\nHe also praised former president Asif Ali Zardari for restoring the powers of the parliament through the 18th Amendment.\nHe warned that the path chosen by the PTI leadership leads towards destruction.\nHe urged the need for unity and consensus to pull the country out of its current crises, lamenting that the PTI leadership has failed to highlight the issues faced by ordinary citizens.\nReferring to the events of May 9, Ashraf condemned the PTI workers and leadership for attacking defence installations and dishonouring the country’s martyrs.\nHe affirmed that the entire nation stands behind Pakistan’s armed forces.",
