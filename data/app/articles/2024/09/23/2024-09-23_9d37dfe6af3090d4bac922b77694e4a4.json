  "content": "MOSCOW, Sep 23 (APP): Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed said ‘Pakistan looks forward to joining BRICS’ & welcomed ‘winds of change blowing all across South Asia which reject hegemony, status quo and seek change’, referring to recent radical changes in the Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.\nHe expressed these views during a keynote address at BRICS seminar.\nAs a consequence, he said the so-called ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy is now drowning in the waters of the Indian Ocean’, a news release said. BRICS (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) is an intergovernmental organisation comprising various nations including the BRICS and Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nSenator Mushahid criticised the recent US sanctions against Pakistan and China, terming these ‘immoral, unjust, unacceptable and illegal’ as sanctions under International Law can only be imposed by the UN Security Council. He also condemned ‘Western hypocrisy and double standards on Palestine’. Senator Mushahid Hussain said the Global Order was marked by turbulence and transformation, with two contrasting narratives. China and Global South are focused on connectivity and trade and economic cooperation.\nSenator Mushahid Hussain urged the BRICS Seminar to define a new narrative based on emerging ground realities to counter propaganda, fake news and disinformation. For the future, Mushahid put forward a 3-D Strategy for BRICS: Democratisation of the world order based on multipolarity, multilateralism, UN Charter and International Law, Demilitarisation of international relations, rejecting any new military alliances like ‘Asian NATO’, QUAD or AUKUS, Dedollarisation of the world economy and greater trade in non-dollar currencies as dollar was being weaponised. Senator Mushahid Hussain was warmly welcomed by the host, Mikhail Shvydkoy, Special Envoy of President Putin, as well China’s Minister for International Communication, Wang Gang. Apart from Russia and China, other countries represented at BRICS Seminar included India, Brazil, South Africa, Egypt, Iran and UAE. Senator Mushahid Hussain was the only representative from a non-BRICS member state.",
