  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 13 (APP):Prime Minister’s Coordinator for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Romina Khurshid Alam on Friday emphasized juvenile education crucial to expedite climate action for long-term resilience goals.\nShe was addressing a seminar on ‘Climate-Compatible Education’ held at the Institute of Regional Studies, Islamabad (IRS) as guest of honour.\nThe PM’s aide underscored the influence even young children could have on their families and communities while citing a four-year-old who vowed to avoid plastic after hearing her speak on World Environment Day. She stressed that early education shapes lifelong habits.\nAlam discussed the significance of advocacy campaigns, carbon credits, and introducing climate education at the Montessori level. She remarked, “if we sow the right seeds, we will get the right fruit.”\nThe seminar was part of the IRS’s pre-COP29 series, brought together important voices from various sectors to discuss the role of education in addressing climate change challenges, highlighting alarming statistics and the actions required for adaptation.\nPunjul Nugraha, Director of the D-8 Organisation for Economic Cooperation, acknowledged that COP29, set to bring together policymakers, experts, and stakeholders, is a crucial platform for integrating climate education into the global agenda.\nHe stated that education is fundamental for understanding and addressing environmental challenges, noting that globally, 1.2 billion children are expected to be affected by climate change by 2050 if urgent measures are not taken. He called for integrating sustainability practices, climate science, and critical thinking at all educational levels.\nAmbassador Khazar Farhadov, Azerbaijan’s Ambassador to Pakistan, reiterated his country’s commitment, as the host of this year’s COP, to global solidarity in combating climate change. He said that Azerbaijan hoped to “lead by example,” highlighting the creation of climate-smart cities throughout the country as part of their development strategy. He stressed that educated populations are more resilient and better equipped to face climate challenges.\nDr Abid Qayium Suleri, Executive Director at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and member of the Advisory Body to the COP29 Presidency, proposed a three-pronged approach to climate-compatible education: curriculum reforms, mitigation through renewable technologies, and adaptation strategies.\nSharmeela Rasool, UNICEF Deputy Country Representative, said that UNICEF’s research shows that over 1 billion children globally live in countries at “extremely high risk” from climate-related disasters. Ms Rasool laid out specific action points to address these challenges, focusing on integrating climate resilience into education systems.\nShakeel Ahmed Ramay, CEO of the Asian Institute of Eco-civilisation, Research, and Development (AIERD), pointed out that with 60% of Pakistan’s population under the age of 30, education must be a key focus in combating climate change.\nHe shared that, following the infrastructural losses amounting to $3 billion due to climate-related disasters in recent years, particularly floods, education systems have been devastated in regions like Balochistan and remote areas. He also suggested integrating green schooling into carbon credit markets.\nZahid Latif Khan, Chairman AIERD, thanked the IRS for organising the event and emphasised the need for collaboration between the Ministry of Climate Change and the Ministry of Education to advance climate-compatible education in Pakistan.\nAmbassador Jauhar Saleem, President IRS, reflected on the stark realities of climate change, citing a World Bank study that showed higher classroom temperatures can lower student learning outcomes by up to 25%, affecting heart and respiratory rates and cognitive responses. Ambassador Saleem emphasised the need to educate Pakistan’s youth on how climate change affects them and their future.\nTalha Tufail Bhatti, who leads the ‘Strengthening Regional Climate Resilience’ Program at IRS, expressed hope that the seminar had shed light on the importance of climate-compatible education. He affirmed IRS’s commitment to continuing dialogues on the subject and organising future events to explore solutions.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
