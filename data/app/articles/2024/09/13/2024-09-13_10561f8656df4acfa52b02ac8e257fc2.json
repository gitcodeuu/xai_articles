  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 13 (APP):The district administration of Islamabad, led by Assistant Commissioner Rural, has arrested 23 persons from different areas of the Federal Capital involved in professional begging.\nThe arrests took place within the jurisdictions of Lohibir, Sahala, Kural, and Hamak police stations, said the spokesman of ICT administration.\nThe arrested beggars were taken to the police station. Meanwhile, minors found begging were sent to the Edhi Center for care and rehabilitation.\nDeputy Commissioner Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon, emphasized the need for stronger measures against professional beggars in the city. He urged citizens to avoid encouraging beggars, as this practice fuels organized begging activities.\nAuthorities have also requested the public’s cooperation in identifying and reporting cases of professional begging. By discouraging this practice, the administration aims to reduce its presence in public spaces and improve the overall environment of the city.\nThe district administration’s action is part of an ongoing campaign to address this issue and enforce the law effectively.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
