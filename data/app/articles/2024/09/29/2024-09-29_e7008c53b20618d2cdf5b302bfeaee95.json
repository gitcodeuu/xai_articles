Protests also erupted in Budgam town and surrounding areas, as well as in Magam, Narbal, Pattan, Bandipore, and numerous other localities.\nDemonstrators chanted anti-Israel and anti-U.S. slogans while voicing strong support for resistance movements, demanding an end to Israeli aggression in Gaza and Lebanon.\n“My heart is shattered; today feels like a dark day,” said Tabish Abbas, a protester from Zadibal. “He was one of the few voices of resistance in the Middle East, fighting for the oppressed. I feel as if my very strength has been taken from me.”\nAnother protestor, Fazil Hussain, expressed his admiration, stating, “Nasrallah was my role model. When I heard of his martyrdom, I knew I couldn’t stay home. I had to join the protest and honor his legacy.”\nHundreds of women also participated in the demonstrations. Shaafia, a participant, shared her emotional turmoil: “I’m still struggling to come to terms with what has happened. I feel shocked and devastated, and I’m at a loss for words to express my feelings.”\nMeanwhile, senior APHC leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq took to the micro-blogging platform ‘X’ to honor Hassan Nasrallah, posting a picture of him with the poignant caption: “Martyrs don’t die; they live on in our hearts as an inspiration.”\nPolitical leader Riyaz Bedar organized a funeral prayer in absentia for Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah at Bedar House in Pattan, honoring his legacy and contributions to the resistance movement.\nNational Conference leader and Member of Indian parliament Aga Syed Ruhullah addressed a late-night protest march in Budgam, stating, “Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah sacrificed his own son for the cause of resistance.”\nHe called for participation in the struggle and ultimately achieved martyrdom on that path.\n“May we all aspire to meet the same fate as Nasrallah.”\nAgha Ruhullah also canceled his campaign en route to Rafiabad, posting on X, “I had to call off my campaign due to this great tragedy. I am truly sorry and ask for your understanding.”\nMehbooba Mufti, the chief of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), announced on her X account, “I am canceling my campaign in solidarity with the martyrs of Lebanon and Gaza, particularly Hassan Nasrallah. We stand with the people of Palestine and Lebanon in this moment of profound grief and exemplary resistance.”\nNC candidate for Sonawari, Hilal Akbar Lone, also canceled his campaign, expressing, “Our events for tomorrow are canceled in light of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s martyrdom. Our hearts are shattered.”\nDr Sameer Siddiqui, a prominent scholar from South Kashmir, described Nasrallah as a figure who fulfilled a divine mission, stating, “He has returned to the mercy of God, to him we belong, and to him we shall return.”\nThese widespread protests demonstrate the profound emotions and solidarity among the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir for Hassan Nasrallah and the broader anti-Israel resistance movement.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
