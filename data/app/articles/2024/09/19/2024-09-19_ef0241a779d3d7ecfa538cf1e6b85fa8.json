The use of cyber and electronic means to commit terrorism in foreign countries is reprehensible,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at her weekly press briefing.\nShe said the terror attacks were the manifestation of Israel’s alarming adventurism in the region, endangering peace and security.\n“Pakistan reaffirms its support for Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and calls upon the international community to take urgent steps to hold Israel accountable for its acts of international terrorism and violation of international laws.”\nShe said Pakistan called for full implementation of ICJ Advisory Opinion delivered on July 19 this year and welcomed the United Nations General Assembly resolution to turn the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ into action.\nShe also condemned the Israeli air strikes on a school and refugees shelter in Gaza and said such attacks on targets, including refugee camps, also violated the spirit of ICJ provisional measures that called for the provision of essential services and humanitarian assistance to address the challenges faced by the Gaza people.\nSpokesperson Baloch told the media that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will participate in the high-level segment of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly in New York from September 23-27 where he would reaffirm Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to multilateralism and express support for the role of the United Nations in forging global peace, security, and prosperity.\nHe will also emphasize the importance of addressing long-standing issues on the agenda of the UN Security Council, including the question of Palestine and Jammu and Kashmir.\nBesides meeting with UN Secretary-General and UNGA President, and members of the Pakistani diaspora, the prime minister will also attend several high-level meetings on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including the high-level meeting on Existential Threats Posed by Sea-level Rise and the UN Security Council’s open debate on leadership for peace.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, who will also accompany the prime minister, would represent Pakistan at the Summit of the Future, convened by the UN Secretary General, on September 22-23. He will also take part in several ministerial meetings, including: OIC FM’s Annual Coordination Meeting; OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir; Ministerial Meeting of G77 and China; and Non-Aligned Movements Ministerial meeting.\nResponding to a question, the spokesperson said Pakistan had rejected the explanation given by the Afghan side on the disrespect of Pakistan’s national anthem by Afghan officials in a ceremony, as it was against the diplomatic norms.\nShe said Pakistan had conveyed strong displeasure to the Afghan authorities, stressing that any individual enjoying diplomatic status should respect the national anthem and flag of the host country. Pakistan reserves the right to take action in accordance with the diplomatic norms and practices, she added.\nTo a question, she clarified that as per data, Acting Consul General, Hafiz Mohibullah Shakir in Pakistan had a valid visa and enjoyed diplomatic status.\nRegarding the visit of Russian delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk, she said both sides held talks and noted the positive momentum in Pakistan-Russia relations and agreed to pursue dialogue and cooperation in areas of trade, industry, energy, connectivity, science, technology, and education.\nThe two sides will also continue to consult and coordinate on multilateral fora, including at the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\nBesides, a Memorandum of Understanding between Pakistan Mercantile Exchange and St. Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange was signed on Wednesday. Pakistan also signed the Instrument of Accession to the MoU on Creation and Development of International Transport Corridor (Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan).\nSpokesperson Baloch said the first phase of “farcical” election exercise in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) conducted under Indian supervision carried no legal value in the eyes of international law.\n“The relevant UN Security Council resolutions clearly state that the final disposition of Jammu and Kashmir will be made in accordance with the will of the people, expressed through a UN-supervised plebiscite. Any other process cannot serve as substitute for the grant of the right of self-determination to Kashmiris,” she remarked.\nShe said 14 political parties had been outlawed there and many political leaders were in detention, therefore such an exercise in the atmosphere of fear and intimidation had no validity.\nResponding to a query, the spokesperson said Pakistan had applied for BRICS membership and yet awaited the response, as being a developing country, Pakistan was qualified to join the group.\nAsked about 11 Pakistani nationals, stuck in the transnational online scamming syndicates based in the neighbouring counties of Thailand across its borders, the spokesperson said Pakistan embassy in Myanmar was in contact with the families to ensure the early release of Pakistani nations from illegal detention of criminals and their repatriation.",
