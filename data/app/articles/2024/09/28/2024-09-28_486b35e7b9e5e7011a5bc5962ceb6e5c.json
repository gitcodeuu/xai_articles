The event also provided opportunity to local civil society organizations, service departments, communities, youth and other humanitarian actors to share their experiences and learning around nutrition programming in Sindh.

By sharing experiences and integrating innovative technologies, we can better address malnutrition.” He further noted that the role of academic institutions is crucial in bringing forth innovative ideas and adds immense value to programming.\nDr Sahib Jan Badar, representing AAP TF presented an overview of Accelerated Action Plan Taskforce achievements and reaffirmed the support of Government of Sindh and stated “The European Union funded CSO strengthening initiative is aligned with the Government of Sindh multi-sectoral Accelerated Action Plan for improved nutrition. Local CSOs are the heart and soul of our communities, and it is through their tireless efforts that we can collaboratively combat malnutrition.”\nDr. Farhana Memon, Director Lady Health Worker Program highlighted the importance of nutrition among children and pregnant and lactating mothers and highlighted that now it’s time to deliver results with commitment. She shared experiences in strengthening services and assured full support to combat malnutrition.\nVice Chancellor (SALU) Professor Dr. Yousuf Khushk applauded this initiative for bringing together diverse stakeholders to address the critical issue of malnutrition in Pakistan.

Our work highlights the importance of grassroots involvement in tackling this crisis and ensuring sustainable improvements in health outcomes.”\nIn Pakistan, the European Union’s support to nutrition commenced with humanitarian assistance after the 2010 floods. Since 2013 this assistance has taken a long-term and sustainable perspective by assisting public departments to deliver nutrition services, within a clear and efficient policy framework. The EU assistance has greatly contributed to the improvement of nutrition. Through the EU supported Strengthening Local Civil Society and Community-based Organisations and their Capacity in the Nutrition Sector in Sindh Project, IRC, MERF and SPO are reinforcing the capacity of 15 local organizations through technical and financial support to foster policy dialogues aimed at informing policy makers with evidence-based findings to shape policies that ultimately help improve health and nutrition services for the most deserving communities.",
