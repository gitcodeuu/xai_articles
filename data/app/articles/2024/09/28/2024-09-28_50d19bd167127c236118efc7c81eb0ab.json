Youth-led eco start ups show emerging leaders addressing climate problems as Pakistan’s innovators are paving the way for better future,” she said.\nGreen Pakistan Alliance Program is one of the many mega efforts funded by US to spend millions of dollars to address climate crisis, she added.\nShe thanked the IoU, SoLF, QAU, COMSATS university, CDA, RWMC, DePaul University, PCRWR and all others involved in GUD for making it a success.\nThe event also showcased videos on the four eco-entrepreneurship projects like Sarsabz Qadam project electricity generation through walking by COMSATS university architects where the pacers were used to help walking and power generation by converting kinetic energy into electric current.\nA panel discussion was held where Director General Water Management CDA, Sardar Khan Zimri, Muhammad Bilal Yameen, Deputy Manager Operations, RWMC and Dr Ejaz Ahmed, IoU.",
