  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 27 (APP): Pakistan’s Consul General in Shanghai, Shehzad Ahmad Khan said China has achieved significant milestones incrementally, steadily, and peacefully over the past 75 years.\nHe said this multidimensional progress and socio-economic transformation have not only established China as a global leader but have also inspired other developing countries to emulate its success.\nShehzad pointed to the nation’s exceptional leadership and long-term vision as the key drivers of this remarkable transformation. “As I traverse the streets of Shanghai, a microcosm of China’s meteoric rise, I am struck by the tangible evidence of the country’s economic prowess and social transformation,” he said in a recent interview with China Economic Net marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.\nHe noted that China’s GDP has made a historic leap from a low starting point to high-speed growth and then to high-quality development, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty—a testament to its commitment to inclusive development.\nThe Consul General also highlighted China’s technological advancements, stating that the country has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence, 5G technology, and renewable energy. He pointed out that the milestone of China’s railways exceeding 160,000 kilometers has significantly contributed to its technological leapfrogging. He said the high-speed rail network alone spans over 46,000 kilometers, consistently ranking among the world’s best. He said this technological prowess is supported by a vibrant tech industry that has nurtured giants like Alibaba and Huawei, both of which engage in collaborative efforts with Pakistan.\n“China has emerged as a global leader, sharing its progress, prosperity, and perspectives with developing countries through platforms like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), along with global development, security, and civilization initiatives,” he said adding, “The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) exemplifies our strategic partnership, showcasing the potential for mutually beneficial cooperation.”\nPakistan has been a steadfast supporter of China since the dawn of the People’s Republic in 1949, becoming one of the first nations to recognize the new China and the pioneering Islamic country to establish diplomatic ties in 1951. This historic gesture laid the groundwork for a partnership that has flourished over time, deepening the bond between the two nations.",
