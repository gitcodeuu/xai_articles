  "content": "UNITED NATIONS, Sep 27 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday warned the world community that the illegal occupation of Palestine and Kashmir was creating a “fresh hell” every day and stressed the efforts for dispute resolution besides addressing the global challenges of terrorism, climate change and Islamophobia.\n“Illegal occupation creates a fresh hell, every day, in the killing fields of Palestine, and in occupied Jammu and Kashmir… Can we turn a blind eye to the mothers, cradling the lifeless bodies of their children? This is not just a conflict; this is systematic slaughter of innocent people; an assault on the very essence of human life and dignity. The blood of Gaza’s children stains the hands of not just the oppressors, but also of those who are complicit in prolonging this cruel conflict,” the prime minister told the annual 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) here.\nThe prime minister, in his 21-minute address at the 193-member Assembly, touched on multiple regional and international issues including Palestine and Kashmir disputes, Ukraine war, climate change, rising poverty and debt burden particularly induced by climate change impacts.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz called upon the international community’s action to demand an immediate end to the bloodshed, as work for a durable peace through a viable, secure, contiguous and sovereign State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its eternal capital.\nBefore the gathering of the global leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz also highlighted the sufferings of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, and said that India had resiled from commitments to implement the UN Security Council resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir which mandated a plebiscite to enable the Kashmiri people to exercise their fundamental right to self-determination.\n“Since 5 August 2019, India has initiated unilateral illegal steps to impose what its leaders ominously call, a “Final Solution” for Jammu and Kashmir. Nine hundred thousand Indian troops terrorize the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir, with draconian measures, including prolonged curfews, extra-judicial killings and the abduction of thousands of young Kashmiris.”\nHe highlighted the Indian nefarious designs of seizing Kashmiri lands and properties, and settling outsiders into occupied Jammu and Kashmir, to transform the Muslim-majority into a minority.\n“This hackneyed tactic is employed by all occupying powers, but it has always failed. In Jammu and Kashmir too, it shall fail, InshaAllah,” he remarked.\nApprising the global leaders of India’s massive expansion of its military capabilities, he said its war doctrines, envisaged a surprise attack and a “limited war under the nuclear overhang”. Thoughtlessly, India has spurned Pakistan’s proposals, for a mutual “Strategic Restraint Regime”. Its leadership has often threatened to cross the Line of Control and “take-over” Azad Kashmir,” he added.\n“Let me state, in no uncertain terms that Pakistan will respond, most decisively, to any Indian aggression,” he remarked.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz called for the reversal of the Indian unilateral and illegal measures of August 5, 2019 to enter into a dialogue for a peaceful resolution, of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.\n“As we leave this august hall, we must carry with us a message for our people that the weak are not voiceless, that the oppressed should not lose hope, that poverty is not pre-ordained, and that the Almighty’s promise of justice and equality in our only terrestrial home, must be respected,” he urged.\nHe said that the daunting challenges of Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza; a dangerous conflict in Ukraine; destructive conflicts across Africa and Asia; rising geopolitical tensions; resurging terrorism; rising poverty; a stifling debt, and the mounting impact of climate change acted as a “chill of a new world order” and lauded the adoption of 54 actions by the Summit of the Future called by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz referred to the devastation caused by climate change-induced floods in Pakistan in 2022 causing $30 billion in damages despite the country’s less than 1% carbon emissions.\n“This is unfair in any calculus of global justice. We must uphold the axiom: the polluter must pay,” he remarked and called for the fulfillment of commitments made by the developed countries in climate financing to support the achievements of the SDGs and climate goals.\nCalling the debt burden on nearly 100 countries a “death trap” impacting their ability to meet the SDGs, he emphasised reforming and aligning the world trade and technology regimes to promote development and global equity.\nThe prime minister told the global leaders that his government had taken difficult but necessary decisions that had “rescued our economy from collapse; restored macroeconomic stability; controlled fiscal deficits; strengthened our reserves. As a result, inflation has come to a single digit.”\nHe said while prioritizing the geo-economics and regional connectivity, the government had launched the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and established the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to mobilize investments, in resilient infrastructure, renewable energy, minerals, sustainable agriculture and technology.\nThe prime minister said that Pakistan had sacrificed around 80,000 lives of soldiers and civilians and suffered economic loss worth $150 billion in its fight against terrorism. He reiterated the nation’s resolve to counter the new wave of “externally financed and sponsored” terrorism, especially by the Fitna al-Khawarij (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) and its associates.\n“Make no mistake, we are determined to eliminate this threat once again, through our comprehensive national effort, “Azm-e-Istehkam” (Resolve to Promote Stability). And, we will work collectively with the international community to combat all forms of terrorism and reform the global counter-terrorism architecture,” he reaffirmed.\nComing to Afghanistan, the prime minister said Pakistan desired the earliest possible normalization of the situation in Afghanistan and joined the UN’s appeal for $3 billion in humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people.\nHe urged the Afghan Interim Government to meet international expectations to respect human rights, including the rights of women and girls, promote political inclusion, and take effective action to neutralize all terrorist groups within Afghanistan, especially those responsible for cross-border terrorism against neighbouring countries. These include ISIL-K (Daesh), the Al-Qaeda-affiliated TTP/Fitna al-Khawarij, Majeed Brigade, BLA and others.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz said that Islamophobia was manifested, by frequent desecrations of the Holy Quran, attacks on mosques, negative stereotyping of Muslims and acts of discrimination and violence against them. The most alarming manifestation of Islamophobia is the Hindu supremacist agenda in India seeking the subjugation of 200 million Muslims and the obliteration of India’s Islamic heritage, he added.\nPakistan and the OIC would work with the UN Secretary-General and his Special Envoy to implement a plan of action to combat this scourge, he assured.\nThe prime minister also sought an immediate end to the tragic conflict in Ukraine, and its peaceful resolution, besides reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to continue to cooperate with Africa to counter terrorism and resolve regional conflicts, including through its role in UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding in the region.",
