He stressed the importance of unity among Muslim countries, particularly in the current global context, which demands efforts to promote harmony, tolerance, and peace. He highlighted that dialogue between religions and civilizations is essential for global peace, and that respect and tolerance are integral to Islamic teachings.\nSalik lauded Oman’s security forces for their swift response following the attack on a mosque in Muscat in July, which prevented further escalation. He also proposed initiatives for exchanges between religious scholars and experts, to deepen the understanding of Islamic teachings through joint conferences and seminars on key religious topics.\nSalik further suggested establishing student exchange programmes between religious institutions of both countries, focusing on the study of Shariah, Quranic teachings, and Islamic history.\nThe two officials discussed various proposals to address growing trends of religious intolerance, terrorism, and sectarianism, while also fostering peace and interfaith harmony. During the meeting, both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in countering extremism and promoting interfaith harmony. They agreed on potential cooperation to improve the curriculum of religious schools (madrasas) in line with contemporary Islamic teachings.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
