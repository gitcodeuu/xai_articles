Because, equipping individuals with skills and resources can lead to sustainable livelihoods, helping communities bounce back economically, socially and psychologically after a disaster,” She stressed.\nAddressing as chief guest at a high-level dialogue ‘The Resilient Reflections’ here on Monday, the Romina highlighted, “Communities, infrastructure and ecosystems are interconnected. Building resilience in one area positively impacts the others, creating a more sustainable and adaptive environment overall.”\nHighlighting the significance of community empowerment with resources, knowledge and skills for disaster resilience, Romina Khurshid remarked that when empowered with necessary resources and skills, the resilient communities are better equipped to withstand and recover from natural disasters.\nHowever, “by fostering local leadership and providing education on disaster preparedness, resources and skills to recover, we can enhance the safety and well-being of our climate-vulnerable communities”, she said.\nThe event was organised jointly by Islamic Relief, National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) and Asian Development Bank in support with Climate Change & Environmental Coordination Ministry and attended by senior officials of federal and provincial organizations, national and international non-governmental organizations, academia, researchers and media.\nShe said further that as Pakistan continues to grapple with the escalating impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events, flooding and resource scarcity, the present government is taking all-out coping measures in collaboration with relevant stakeholders for building resilience and adaptive capacity of the communities, their livelihoods, ecosystems and public infrastructures.\nRomina Khurshid told the participants that there is need to understand that building resilience is not just a strategy; it’s a necessity for our future, which is at stake because of unfolding climate crisis.\n“Achieving resilient future, there is dire need for all stakeholders including federal and provincial government organisations and other national and international civil society organizations to work closely to empower vulnerable communities with skills and resources, strengthen public infrastructure and protect ecosystems to navigate the challenges ahead for sustainable and resilient future,” the PM’s climate aide remarked.\nFor this strengthening infrastructure, Romina Khurshid Alam said,  is crucial for economic stability and public safety, adding that upgrading roads, bridges, and water management systems ensures that they can endure the impacts of climate change, reducing the risk of catastrophic failures.\nRecognizing the multifaceted risks that Pakistan faces, including frequent flooding, droughts, and seismic activity, she said that empowering local communities through a holistic approach that integrates environmental sustainability, disaster risk reduction, and community engagement is crucial.\n“By fostering an inclusive environment for communities to sustain, recover and thrive in the disaster times, we can help the voices of the climate-vulnerable communities get heard and considered in decision-making processes, ultimately leading to a more equitable and resilient society,” Romina Khurshid Alam emphasised.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
