  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 30 (APP): An Accountability Court (AC) on Monday acquitted former Senate deputy chairman Saleem Mandviwala and others in the Kidney Hills reference.\nAccountability Court Judge Nasir Javed Rana approved the application of National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and returned the reference.\nThe NAB, in its plea, stated that Mandviwala had no connection with the case. Moreover there was no loss to the government treasury, rather it was a private party which suffered the losses.\nThe Bureau pleaded the court to acquit the accused.\nThe NAB said that the reference was filed on January 19, 2021 against seven accused. The matter was presented before its executive board in September (2024), which reached a conclusion that the reference could not be made as per the facts, it added.\nThe court, subsequently, approved the request of NAB and acquitted the seven persons.",
