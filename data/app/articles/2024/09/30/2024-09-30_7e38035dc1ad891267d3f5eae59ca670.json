As we mark Canada’s National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, today’s dialogue is a testament to our collective responsibility to support those most vulnerable to climate change and exclusion, including Indigenous communities. This is especially true in countries like Pakistan, where climate change disproportionately impacts those living on the margins.”\nCanada’s approach to Indigenous rights, Scanlon noted, centers on recognition, cooperation, and partnership.\nShe added that in both Canada and Pakistan, climate change and environmental degradation affect Indigenous and local communities more severely, making inclusion in policy and decision-making critical for achieving sustainable development.\nAziz Boolani echoed this sentiment, highlighting the role of corporations like Serena Hotels in promoting sustainability: “At Serena Hotels, our commitment to sustainability and inclusivity drives us to elevate the needs and experiences of Indigenous communities. This dialogue further underscores our dedication to climate resilience, ensuring that no community—regardless of size or location—is left out of global solutions.”\nThe strategic dialogue also addressed gender parity, underscoring the intersection of climate action with the empowerment of women and marginalized groups.\nSardar Ramesh Singh Arora stressed the importance of inclusion in both local and national governance structures, stating, “The progress of any society depends on how well it uplifts its most vulnerable. Ensuring that Indigenous peoples and women are empowered is crucial to building a more equitable and resilient future for all.”\nSerena Hotels, known for its Public Diplomacy initiative, has consistently used its platform to foster discussions on pressing global issues. This dialogue, attended by policymakers, corporate leaders, and civil society, aimed to deepen understanding of the interconnected challenges of climate change, gender equity, and Indigenous rights.\nThe event culminated in discussions on actionable partnerships that could strengthen Indigenous resilience to climate shocks and promote socio-economic inclusion across Pakistan.\nBy bringing together a diverse array of stakeholders, the High Commission of Canada and Serena Hotels reaffirmed their commitment to fostering global partnerships that address the unique challenges facing Indigenous communities, particularly in the face of climate change. The dialogue sets the stage for future collaborations that seek to build more inclusive, equitable, and climate-resilient communities both in Pakistan and worldwide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
