He noted that all four provinces already have similar laws in place, and Islamabad was in need of such legislation.\nSiddiqui also highlighted the broad support for the law, which was passed with the backing of multiple political parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party, MQM, Awami National Party, Balochistan Awami Party, and several independent members.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
