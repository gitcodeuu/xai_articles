  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 5 (APP): Federal Minister for Petroleum Dr. Musadik Malik on Thursday said that the government was committed to providing employment opportunities for the country’s youth.\n“The youth are the future of the nation and assured that they will not be left disheartened by the challenges ahead” he expressed these views while speaking at the CEO Summit.\nThe minister outlined key government initiatives aimed at creating job opportunities and boosting the country’s exports.\nHe said that rather than allocating $5 billion to large corporations, the government was focusing on developing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in urban areas. “We are committed to building SMEs to strengthen urban economies,” he added.\nMusadik highlighted the importance of the IT sector in driving job creation and economic growth, especially through the application of artificial intelligence (AI).\nHe said that AI can play a crucial role in boosting exports and enhancing Pakistan’s GDP.\nHe also stressed the need for modernization in the agricultural sector, a key contributor to Pakistan’s economy. By leveraging AI, the country can reduce the wastage of perishable goods, particularly fruits and vegetables, improving export opportunities.\nHe said that agriculture currently contributes only 6.8% to Pakistan’s GDP, which needs to increase through innovation.\nAddressing the nation’s growing energy demands, he reassured that the government was working on enhancing the energy sector by focusing on local resources and renewable energy solutions such as solar and wind power.\nHe also highlighted the potential environmental benefits of transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) in reducing carbon emissions.\nThough Pakistan contributes minimally to global carbon emissions, he said, that it ranks among the top ten countries most affected by climate change.\nHe called for the adoption of green energy sources to address the energy crisis and advance the country’s sustainability goals.",
