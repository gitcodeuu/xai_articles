  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 09 (APP): Parliamentary Leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in Senate Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui on Monday said the ‘Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill 2024’ was aimed at safeguarding the citizens’ rights.\nSpeaking on a point of order soon after the commencement of the Senate’s proceedings with Presiding Officer Sherry Rehman in the chair, he presented his arguments in the defence of the legislation passed by the House rejecting the opposition benches’ criticism.\nSenator Siddiqui alleged that Leader of Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz had passed sarcastic remarks indirectly targeting his stature.\nHe said that the opposition leader made some tongue-in-cheek remarks on his poetry, Urdu and linguistic style of speech at the floor of the House.\n“It is not derogatory but a tribute to myself from the member. I try to circumvent remarks that may hurt any member. Shibli Faraz had appreciated my conduct of the House twice.\n“However, I forgo all those remarks and don’t want to give any rebuttal on it,” Senator Siddiqui said.\nHe added that the Peaceful Assembly law was supported by some 60 members of five political parties, including PPP, MQM, PML-N, BAP and independents.\nHe said every civilized country had such laws. The United Kingdom had three laws on peaceful public assembly that entailed strict penalties on their violations, including heavy fine and the 10-year imprisonment. Similarly, every state in the United States had separate laws and strict penalties including imprisonment of four years on their violation.\nSenator Siddiqui cited Article 16 of the Constitution, which stated,”Every citizen has the right to assemble peacefully without arms subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by the law.”\nThe administration should have authority to regulate processions and protests, which, however, had been limited by the legislation, he added.\nSome 2.5 million residents of the Federal Capital had the right of free movement and they could not be confined like animals in the barricaded metropolis during protests, he said.\nSenator Siddiqui urged Shibli Faraz to better confine his remarks to law and legislation and avoid targeting his Urdu and poetry.\nIn response, Senator Shibli Faraz said though the opposition and treasury benches had discussed the law thoroughly but it would not serve the democracy.\n“Every citizen and institution of the country should abide by the law. We should legislate keeping in view the spirit of the Constitution.”",
