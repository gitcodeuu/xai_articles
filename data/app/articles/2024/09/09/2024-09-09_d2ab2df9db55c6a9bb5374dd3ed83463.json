  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 09 (APP):Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui on Monday told the National Assembly that 20 Pink Buses have been allocated to provide free of cost pick and drop facilities to female students, working women, and female teachers in Islamabad.\nResponding to a question during Question Hour, he said the initiative of Pink Buses has been taken to avoid drop-outs of girl students.\nHe said at present there were 311 operational buses at FDE Schools and Colleges to provide fetch and drop facility to the students of the federal capital. Previously 258 buses were functional and remaining were dysfunctional and parked due to either shortage of fuel fund, machinery faults or unviability of drives, he said.\nHe said it is worth to mention here that FDE under M/o FEPT recently added 78 more buses from dysfunctional buses to the pool of operational buses of public schools/colleges due to which the total number of operational buses have increased from 258 to 331.\nHe said there was serious issue of shortage of funds for fuel and shortage of drivers and conductors. To cater this problem and to facilitate students and teachers, the FDE under M/o FEPT hired 200 drivers and conductors from third party through competition to provide bus service to the students of public schools, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
