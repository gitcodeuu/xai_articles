This year’s theme, “Promoting Multilingual Education: Literacy for Mutual Understanding and Peace,” was highlighted by the president to underscore the vital role of literacy in fostering unity, cultural appreciation, and peaceful coexistence.\nIn his message, President Asif Ali Zardari highlighted Pakistan’s declaration of a National Educational Emergency in response to the urgent challenge of illiteracy.\nThis initiative aims to enroll out-of-school children and educate 70 million adults. He noted that under the Prime Minister’s Roshan Pakistan Literacy Drive, the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) has launched the “Each One Teach One” (EOTO) Program, which encourages every literate citizen to teach at least one illiterate person.\nIn order to enhance literacy, the government is providing Conditional Cash Transfers up to the higher secondary level through Benazir Taleemi Wazaif for educating underprivileged children. Stipends up to Rs 4000 for boys and Rs 4500 for girls per quarter are being offered in all districts of Pakistan. Currently, 9.7 million children are enrolled under the programme.\nFurthermore, 102,000 scholarships have been given to students from low-income families to ensure that all qualified students have access to undergraduate education.\nOn International Literacy Day, it is essential to renew commitment to advancing the universal right to education. By working together, it is possible to ensure that every Pakistani has the chance to learn, develop, and contribute to a more educated, inclusive, and prosperous nation.\nEach individual plays a crucial role in shaping the future of the country.
