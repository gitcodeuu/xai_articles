The priority of the world should be to address the problems being faced by humanity, including poverty, hunger, injustice, oppression, inequality, and the violation of basic human rights rather than disputes and conflicts,” he added.\nAdditionally, the president added that world could not achieve progress and development in the absence of peace as wars and conflicts increase the problems and miseries of people.",
