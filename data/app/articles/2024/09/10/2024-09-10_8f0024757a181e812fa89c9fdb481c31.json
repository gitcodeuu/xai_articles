  "content": "LAHORE, Sep 10 (APP):A Lahore High Court (LHC) two-member bench on Tuesday restored Lieutenant General Muhammad Munir Afsar as the Chairman of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA).\nThe two-member bench suspended the single bench verdict that had declared the appointment of NADRA Chairman Lieutenant General Muhammad Munir Afsar illegal and issued notices to the parties, seeking their replies.\nThe bench, comprising Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Iqbal and Justice Ahmad Nadeem Arshad, passed the orders while hearing an intra-court appeal filed by the federal government challenging the single bench verdict.\nDuring the proceedings, Advocate Rashidi Nawaz appeared on behalf of the government and argued that the single bench’s verdict, which had declared Afsar’s appointment illegal based on a petition filed by Ashba Kamran, was against the facts. He submitted that the petitioner had challenged the appointment notification issued by the interim government, but she had never challenged the new amended rule.\nAt this, the bench suspended the single bench’s verdict and issued notices to the parties, seeking their replies.\nA single bench comprising Justice Asim Hafeez had declared the appointment of NADRA’s chairman unlawful on September 6.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
