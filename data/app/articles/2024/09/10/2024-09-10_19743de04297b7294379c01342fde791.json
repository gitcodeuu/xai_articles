By investing in women, businesses not only strengthen their operations but also contribute to the broader development of society,” She further added, “Empowering women economically is a key to unlocking their full potential. This means ensuring equal pay for equal work, providing opportunities for women in leadership, and supporting women entrepreneurs. When women have the means and opportunities to contribute economically, entire communities’ benefit, leading to improved health, education, and social outcomes.\nIn keynote remarks, Mr. Jam Kamal Khan the Minister of Commerce, highlighted the importance of digital inclusion as a pathway to economic equality. ” The private sector plays a major role in driving change, and today’s event has showcased the need of collaboration in achieving gender equality. Technology is the great equalizer, and digital inclusion is the bridge to economic equality. By prioritizing digital inclusion, we can remove the barriers that have historically kept women out of the economic mainstream.  Ministry of Commerce, through its new e-commerce policy, will empower women by implementing various policies and facilitation measures,” the minister asserted.\nThe event also featured two insightful panel discussions. The first, “Leveraging Digital and Financial Inclusion for Enhanced Livelihoods of Our Women and Girls,” focused on improving access to finance and digital resources. Key speakers included  Musarat Jabeen from SECP, who discussed improving access to finance for women entrepreneurs;  Shumaila Rifaqat from Karandaaz, who spoke about promoting access to SMEs and financial inclusion; and Nadeem Malik from P@SHA, who addressed the gender digital divide.
