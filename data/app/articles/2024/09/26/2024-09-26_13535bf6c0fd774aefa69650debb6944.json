  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 26 (APP): Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch Thursday urged the international community to take prompt action to hold Israel accountable for its acts of international terrorism, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\nDuring her weekly media briefing, the spokesperson expressed Pakistan’s concern about the security situation in the Middle East, attributing it to Israel’s increasing adventurism and disregard for international law.\nShe stated that last week’s military actions against Lebanon represent a serious violation of the UN Charter and international law, emphasizing that this dangerous escalation has further threatened peace and security in an already unstable region. Pakistan continues to reaffirm its steadfast support for Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nAdditionally, she noted that for nearly a year, Israeli occupation forces have been conducting a systematic genocidal campaign in Gaza, committing significant violations of international humanitarian law.\nThis week, she said Israel sent a container of decomposing bodies of 88 Palestinians to Gaza without providing any information about the victims’ identities or the circumstances of their deaths.\nThis appalling act violates international humanitarian law, which mandates the respectful handling and identification of the deceased. By withholding the names and genders of the victims, Israeli occupation forces have stripped them of their dignity and exacerbated the suffering of their families. No family should be denied the right to bury their loved ones with honor. Israel must reveal the identities of the deceased and ensure that their remains are returned to their families in a dignified manner, she stated.\nReiterating Pakistan’s support for the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), she affirmed that Pakistan will continue to provide political, diplomatic, and moral support to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters in seeking a just and peaceful resolution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in line with United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions.\nShe stated that the Contact Group of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Jammu and Kashmir convened on last Wednesday during the 79th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York. Chaired by OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, the meeting included representatives from the member states of the Contact Group—Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, Niger, and Azerbaijan. A delegation of the True Representatives of the Kashmiri People also participated.\nShe stated that Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, who led the Pakistani delegation to the meeting, provided an update to the Contact Group on the political, security, and human rights situation in IIOJK.\nMember states of the Contact Group stressed the importance of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute on the OIC’s agenda and expressed their support for the rights and freedoms of the Kashmiri people. They called for a prompt and peaceful resolution of the dispute.\nThe meeting concluded with the adoption of a comprehensive Joint Communiqué, reaffirming the OIC’s unwavering support for the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people to realize their inalienable right to self-determination in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions.\nThe Communiqué also condemned the banning of several Kashmiri political parties and the ongoing efforts to confiscate the properties of Kashmiri activists. It emphasized that the so-called electoral processes in IIOJK cannot replace the exercise of the right to self-determination.\nThe Contact Group also called upon India to halt the human rights violations in the IIOJK and take steps for the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.\nRegarding Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif’s visit, she said PM is in New York for the high-level segment of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The prime minister will address the UN General Assembly on Friday.\nHe attended the “SDG Moment” event, emphasizing the need for support for developing countries facing debt traps due to climate change and an unfair global financial system. He also participated in the “High-Level meeting on the Existential Threat Posed by Sea-Level Rise” and the UN Security Council’s Open Debate on “Leadership for Peace.”\nIn his statement on “Leadership for Peace” during the UN Security Council’s High-Level Open Debate, the prime minister emphasized that escalating wars, great power tensions, and rising poverty are undermining global stability. He proposed actions to tackle these challenges and strengthen peace and security, committing to pursue these objectives when Pakistan assumes its seat on the Security Council next year.\nOn the sidelines of the UNGA Session, the prime minister held bilateral meetings with various leaders, including President Muizzu of Maldives, President Erdogan of Turkiye, President Pazeshkian of Iran, President Abbas of Palestine, Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah of Kuwait, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\nResponding to a question, the spokesperson stated that Türkiye maintains a consistent and principled stance on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, with its leadership and diplomats advocating for the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination at various forums, including the OIC. As an active member of the OIC contact group on Jammu and Kashmir, Türkiye aligned with the consensus in the recent joint communiqué, reaffirming its strong support for the Kashmiri people. Therefore, the spokesperson advised against drawing undue inferences from any single statement.\nResponding to another question regarding regional connectivity, the spokesperson stated that Pakistan, along with all neighboring and near-neighboring countries of Afghanistan, is concerned about peace and security in Afghanistan. Pakistan is actively engaging with its neighbors through various forums, including the neighboring countries format, to explore options for cooperation with Afghanistan. The aim is to ensure that Afghan territory does not pose a threat to its neighbors and to facilitate peace and prosperity within Afghanistan, enabling vital connectivity projects to see light of the day.\nThe spokesperson emphasized the need to view the situation in Afghanistan from the right perspective. Pakistan is deeply concerned about the welfare of the Afghan people and believes it is crucial for both Pakistan and the international community to create economic opportunities and conditions for peace and prosperity in Afghanistan. This is particularly important for Pakistan, as it seeks the early and honorable return of Afghan refugees currently in the country.\nRegarding the use of Afghan territory against Pakistan, the spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan has raised this issue both bilaterally and within the international community, including the UN. Pakistan has highlighted the threat posed by terror elements using Afghan soil against its security and calls for Afghan authorities to take action against these hideouts and sanctuaries, which endanger not only Pakistan but also its neighbors.\nRegarding meeting with Iranian president, the spokesperson stated that Pakistan and Iran, as close neighbors, maintain several communication channels and engage at the leadership level, reflecting the importance both countries place on dialogue. This high-level engagement can help foster mutual benefits and address economic and trade issues.\nThe spokesperson in response to question explained that the Council of Heads of Government meeting of SCO member states is the second highest forum of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, addressing economic, social, cultural, and financial matters. It focuses on enhancing cooperation in trade, connectivity, transport links, and investment in key sectors. Topics related to economy, trade finance, and economic collaboration outlined in the Astana declaration will be further discussed at the upcoming meeting in Islamabad.\nIn response to a question, the spokesperson stated that Pakistan supports SCO initiatives that enhance connectivity among member states. The SCO is well-positioned to develop new transport and road linkages, strengthening interconnectivity. Pakistan fully backs the Belt and Road Initiative, viewing it as a key connectivity project in the region, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is essential for Pakistan’s economic prosperity and development.\nRegarding scholarships to Bangladesh students, the spokesperson highlighted the long history of collaboration between Pakistan and Bangladesh in education, science, and people-to-people domains. Pakistan has previously offered several scholarships to Bangladeshi students, and these opportunities remain available. The country looks forward to welcoming more Bangladeshi students on educational scholarships in the future.\nResponding to another question, the spokesperson affirmed Pakistan’s commitment to ensuring the security and comfort of all diplomats in the country. Foreign diplomats are encouraged to explore Pakistan while adhering to travel guidelines provided to them.\nPakistan condemned the incident on September 23 and stated that security agencies are investigating. When substantial information is available, it will be released. The trip in question was organized by the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce, not by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the government has noted the lapses in communication regarding this high-profile visit. Guidelines are being developed to prevent such incidents in the future.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister has met with ambassadors from the involved countries, assuring them of a thorough investigation and measures for their safety. Regarding travel to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, all protocols were followed, and individual inquiries from ambassadors were communicated to the provincial government with documentary evidence.\nResponding to another question, she said some ambassadors individually informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about their travel, as is customary, and this information was shared with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.\nHowever, the Chamber of Commerce did not communicate details about the event they organized, which led to the situation of multiple ambassadors traveling together without prior information. The Ministry is currently discussing and\ndeliberating on how to rectify this oversight and improve processes for the future.",
