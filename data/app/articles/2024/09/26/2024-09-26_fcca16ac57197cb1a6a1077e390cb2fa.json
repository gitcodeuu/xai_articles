This year’s theme, “Navigating the Future: Safety First,” reflects the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) commitment in enhancing maritime safety and security while protecting the marine environment.\nThe catastrophic maritime accidents of the Titanic and SS Torrey Canyon served as wake-up calls, prompting international conventions to prioritize safety and environmental protection.\nPakistan, with its 1,000-kilometer coastline, joins the global community in observing this day. The country’s maritime sector plays a crucial role in its economy, with over 290,000 square metres of coastline and a special economic zone.\nPrincipal of the Maritime Training Institute Captain Rashid Anwar emphasized that 90 percent of maritime accidents result from human error.\nHe praised Pakistani seafarers’ training and notes the importance of adhering to IMO regulations. The Maritime Training Institute, affiliated with Glasgow College, offers advanced shipping courses and boasts state-of-the-art simulators.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
