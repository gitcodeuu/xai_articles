In accordance with the legal mandate emphasizing the prompt resolution of cases, the office has effectively processed the majority of these cases, with only 14 in progress.\nThis demonstrates the office’s commitment to expeditiously addressing complaints of workplace harassment and ensuring timely justice for individuals affected.\nThe statistical data presented reveals significant trends regarding the operations of FOSPAH in Pakistan. Over this period, a total of 3,571 cases were registered with FOSPAH, reflecting the persistent prevalence of workplace harassment issues in the country.\nOf these cases, 3,.368 were disposed of, indicating the institution’s efforts in addressing complaints effectively.
