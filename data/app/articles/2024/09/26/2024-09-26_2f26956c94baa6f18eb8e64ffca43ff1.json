  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 26 (APP):Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that the government was introducing major reforms to promote the tourism industry and make the country a tourist destination.\n“We have undertaken major reforms by adopting a tourist-friendly visa regime under which tourists from 126 countries can obtain fast-track visas without fee. I am confident that this decision will play a key role in in the promotion of the tourism sector and open new avenues for socioeconomic development in Pakistan,” the prime minister said in a message on the World Tourism Day being observed on Friday (Sept 27).\nHe said,”Pakistan joins the global community to celebrate the World Tourism Day under the patronage of the United Nations Tourism Organization.”\n“This year’s theme ‘Tourism and Peace’”, he said, truly reflected an important aspect of tourism. “Indeed tourism brings people together and plays a vital role as a catalyst for fostering peace, harmony, and empathy among nations and diverse cultures,” he added.\nThe prime minister highlighted that tourism had emerged as a dynamic sector in an increasingly multicultural world. The nations around the globe had benefitted from its vast potential to expand people-to-people contacts; remove misconceptions and stereotypes; promote a positive image through social interaction, build relations, and stimulate inclusive economic growth.\nPakistan, he said, was blessed with scenic natural landscapes, verdant plains, sparkling rivers and streams, and breath-taking mountain ranges.\n“Pakistan is home to ancient civilizations, including Mehrgarh, Mohenjo Daro, Harappa and Gandhara.”\n“All this”, he said, “provides us a great opportunity for the development of tourism and linking it with the livelihoods development at the grassroots level even in the remotest of areas of Pakistan. The significant potential of tourism to drive economic growth, create jobs, and promote peace through cultural exchange could be realized through our joint efforts.”\nHe said the young generation could also play a key role in promoting tourism through innovative solutions and developing new business models.\n“On its part, the government is promoting entrepreneurial initiatives in the tourism industry, which, with its dense backward linkages, supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals more than any other industry.”\nHe also expressed his satisfaction that both the Federation and the provinces were taking commendable initiatives for promoting recreation, adventure, religious, heritage, sports, eco, wildlife and cultural tourism in all regions of Pakistan.\n“Let us work jointly to promote Pakistan as a premier tourist destination by showcasing our warmth, hospitality, and resilience to the world. Together, we can unlock the full potential of sustainable tourism, and create a brighter and peaceful future for our next generations,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
