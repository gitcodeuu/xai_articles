  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 26 (APP): The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict in a case regarding the quota of children of government employees in jobs.\nA three-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa heard the case.\nDuring the course of proceedings, the chief justice asked that whether there was any law or logic to give jobs to the children of government employees, who after retirement got pension.\nHe observed that under Article 27 of the Constitution, all citizens of Pakistan were equal. If the practice (of giving jobs to children of retired government employees) would continue then no one else would be able to get a government job.\nEarlier, the Additional Attorney General told the court that the Punjab Government had already abolished the job quota of retired employees’ children by amending the service rules.\nThe Additional Advocate General Sindh informed the bench that there was a law to give jobs to the children of retired government employees in the province.",
