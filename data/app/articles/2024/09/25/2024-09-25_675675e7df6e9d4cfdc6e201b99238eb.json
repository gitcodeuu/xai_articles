  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 25 (APP): Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal on Wednesday chaired the inaugural meeting of the Education Task Force and expressed serious concerns over the current state of education in the country.\nAmong others, the meeting was attended by Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Chief Secretaries from all provinces, and representatives from the Ministry of Education, UNICEF, UNDP, FCDO, UNESCO, the World Bank, ADB, Malala Fund, ITA and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute, a news release said.\nCiting alarming data from the Education Index, the minister stressed the need for urgent and immediate actions in the education sector.\nHe highlighted that approximately 25 million children in Pakistan were currently out of school, and the literacy rate stood at a mere 60%, which is a matter of grave concern.\nThe minister emphasized that the government’s aim was not just to enroll children in schools but to provide them with quality education. “We must equip every child with basic computer skills and modern technical education, along with establishing state-of-the-art laboratories,” he stated.\nTerming the initiative as a significant challenge, he underscored that no educational reforms would succeed\nwithout improving teacher training in the country.\nAhsan Iqbal pointed out that every individual could not reach higher education or a PhD level, so it was crucial to impart vocational and technical skills alongside formal education. “This will help ensure students in becoming useful productive members of society.”\nHe also referred to the Federal Public Service Commission’s report, which highlighted several gaps in the existing curriculum, calling for its alignment with international standards.\nThe federal minister also commented on the impact of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which devolved education to the provinces in 2010. Since then, he noted, the literacy rate has declined.\nHe stressed the importance of focusing on both education and health, as Pakistan was among the top countries in the world for cases of hepatitis, tuberculosis, diabetes, and polio.\nDuring the meeting, Ahsan Iqbal acknowledged the contributions of all stakeholders and international partners, emphasizing the need for a public-private partnership in both the education and health sectors.\nHe assured that the federal government would not leave the provinces to tackle these fundamental issues alone but would collaborate with them to implement practical measures in both sectors.\nIn his concluding remarks, Ahsan Iqbal said that the development of nations depended on reforms, stability, and policy continuity.\n“No society can progress without adhering to the principles of stability. We must avoid short-term changes and instead focus on adopting long-term policies,” he stressed.",
