Some 42 national and international scholars will present their research papers.\nDr Nasir Mahmood said the AIOU had an annual enrolment of over one million students, with 54 regional campuses across Pakistan.\n“Students at this institution come from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, including those from remote areas, and they all are provided with equal educational opportunities,” he added.\nThe VC expressed the hope that the conference would help devise a comprehensive strategy to safeguard endangered languages.\nForum for Language Initiatives (FLI) Chairman Rozi Khan Burki, in his address, said over 70 languages were spoken in Pakistan and many of them were at risk of extinction.\nHe stressed that the government should take concrete measures to ensure their survival.\nDean of the Faculty of Social Sciences Professor Abdul Aziz Sahir said,”No language is small or large; each has its own culture and history.”\nA language with literature, stories, and poetry could not become extinct, he added. “As long as mothers are alive in society, so too will their mother tongues survive.”\nHe emphasized the importance of oral traditions in preserving languages.\nDr Hakim Elnazarov, Board Member of the Foundation for Endangered Languages (FEL), pointed out that over 7,000 languages were spoken worldwide, but a recent research indicated that “one language disappears every week”.\nHe stressed that safeguarding the languages must be a top priority.\nThe opening ceremony was hosted by Dr Rashida Imran, Assistant Professor of the English Department, while Dr. Muhammad Kamal Khan, Head of the English Department, delivered the welcome address.\nThroughout the three days, national and international linguistics experts, some through online, will present their research papers.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
