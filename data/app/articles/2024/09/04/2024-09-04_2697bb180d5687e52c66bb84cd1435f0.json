Special attention was given to the needs of children with disabilities, transgender children, and the prevention of child exploitation.\nParticipants highlighted the significant role parents play in shaping their children’s physical, emotional, and psychological growth. In Pakistan, many parents face substantial challenges in raising their children due to a lack of structured guidance and support.\n“The Art of Parenting Manual” has been introduced to address these challenges, providing much-needed assistance to parents in their child-rearing efforts.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
