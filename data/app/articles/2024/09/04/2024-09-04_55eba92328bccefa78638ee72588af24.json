The World Bank will provide 70% of the funds for the smart meters project, while the government will arrange the remaining 30 per cent, he added.\nHe said no load shedding is being carried out in the country on account of generation shortfall. All power distribution companies (DISCOs) were carrying out load management in their areas based on the losses of feeders, he added.
