This moment did not only signify the birth of a new nation but also laid the foundation for the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 when Sabah and Sarawak joined hands with the federation. Together, we have grown, through trials and tribulations, emerging stronger as a united nation. As we celebrate our 67th year of independence, we must also recognize the significant strides Malaysia has made in building a resilient and dynamic economy, and our country has grown into a key player in the global market with a diversified economy that spans sectors such as manufacturing, technology, and services. This economic progress is not only a reflection of our nation’s hard work and determination but also a crucial foundation for our future aspirations,” the envoy said.\nHe said tha the significance of this day lied not only in remembrance of the struggles and sacrifice of the founding fathers but also in recognizing the diverse cultural tapestry that defines Malaysia today.\n“The principles of unity, tolerance, and mutual respect remain central to the Malaysian identity, reflecting a nation that has learned to embrace its multiculturalism as an indelible strength,” he said.\nThe High Commissioner said, “Every year, on August 31, Malaysians from all walks of life—regardless of race, religion, or political belief—unite to celebrate the National Day, marking the moment when our beloved nation gained independence on this very day in 1957.\nHe said that it was a day for us to honor their legacy by continuing to uphold the values of unity, tolerance, and respect that they envisioned for Malaysia.\nHe said the evening before that historic day, Malaysians stood united at the Selangor Club in Kuala Lumpur, witnessing the lowering of the British Union Jack and the hoisting of our flag, Jalur Gemilang. “The following morning, in a moment that has been etched in the annals of history, thousands gathered at Merdeka Stadium, where the Duke of Gloucester, representing Her Majesty the Queen, handed a symbol of independence to our first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman”, he added.\n“Tunku Abdul Rahman, with the strength of timbre accompanied by the people’s spirit, declared ‘Merdeka’ seven times, marking the dawn of a new era for Malaya,” he said.\nHe said, “In moving forward, let us renew our commitment to building better Malaysia for future generations. Let us embrace our diversity as our strength and work together to achieve greater heights.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
