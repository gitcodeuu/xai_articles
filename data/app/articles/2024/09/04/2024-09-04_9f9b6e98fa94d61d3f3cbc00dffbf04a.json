  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 04 (APP):Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, called on the government to thoroughly examine the issues that led to the resignation of Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal.\nSpeaking on a point of order in the National Assembly, he called for serious efforts to address the challenges facing Balochistan.\nOmar Ayub asserted that the people of Balochistan have legitimate grievances and that the province’s resources rightfully belong to its residents.\nThe opposition leader also called on all political parties to take the situation seriously and address pressing issues, including the non-payment of electricity royalties to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nSenior leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Muhammad Hanif Abbasi demanded that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) apologize for the events of May 9.\nHe accused PTI of using funds from Israel and the United States to target the country’s institutions and claimed that the Leader of the Opposition had undermined Pakistan’s armed forces and insulted the families of martyrs.\nHanif Abbasi said that, despite the incidents of May 9, those responsible had not yet faced any consequences. He said that if the opposition leader had criticized Indian or Israeli forces, it might have provided some relief to the nation, but instead, the speech was directed against Pakistan’s armed forces.\nHe also condemned the attacks on military installations, asserting that these were orchestrated by PTI and witnessed by the entire nation.\nHe claimed that the evidence and witnesses against PTI were substantial, making it difficult for the party to evade responsibility.\nHanif Abbasi criticized PTI for its inability to address internal issues and suggested that the party should seek an apology rather than resorting to derogatory language.\nHe called for recognition of the sacrifices made by officers and soldiers in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
