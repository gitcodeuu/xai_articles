  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 04 (APP):The Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) has issued a show cause notice to the President of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Commission (PM&DC) for failing to appear before the Commission during a hearing held on September 4, 2024.\nThis hearing was in response to an appeal filed by a citizen, Ms Saddia Mazhar, who sought information from the PMDC under her right to access information as guaranteed by Article 19-A of the Constitution of Pakistan, said a press release.\nDespite being issued two prior notices—on August 6, 2024, and August 26, 2024—no representative from the PMDC attended the hearing. The PIC confirmed that the notice dated August 26, 2024, was successfully delivered, as verified by the Pakistan Post’s website.\nGiven the non-compliance, the Commission has ordered that a show cause notice be issued to the President of the PMDC, with a copy sent to the Secretary of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations, and Coordination.\nThe President is required to explain why proceedings under Section 20(f) of the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017, should not be initiated against him for failing to comply with the Commission’s orders.\nMs. Saddia Mazhar had requested the PMDC to provide a province-wise list of medical colleges against which complaints regarding irregularities in admission tests and interviews were received from January 2021 to date, along with details of the actions taken.\nShe also sought a list of medical colleges accused of demanding or receiving higher fees in the form of donations or other means, as well as the actions taken on these complaints.\nAdditionally, she requested information on the measures taken by the PMDC to ensure that private colleges adhere to the fixed fee structure and copies of inquiry reports conducted by the PMDC against medical colleges for irregularities in admissions during the same period.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
