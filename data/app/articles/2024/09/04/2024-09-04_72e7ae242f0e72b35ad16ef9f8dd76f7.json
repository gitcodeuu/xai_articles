It is designed to support data-driven policy making, enhance understanding of risks, ensure effective resource allocation. The Unit will provide data-driven analysis and evidence-based recommendations to identify threats and risks facing Pakistan’s borders, and allow for more efficient management of border resources.\nAddressing the ceremony, DG FIA Ahmad Ishaque Jehangir highlighted the importance of the offices to the FIA’s mandate to control immigration and counter serious and organized crimes. “Effective, open and secure border management is critical to ensuring the safety and security of our citizens, promoting stability, and facilitating trade and development,” he said.\nHe expressed gratitude to the international community for their support in establishing the Risk Analysis Unit and the Three Lines Border Control Concept. He highlighted the economic, social, and political challenges posed by illegal immigration and emphasized the need for cooperation and joint efforts to address these issues.\nInternational representatives, including Dr. Sebastian Lorion from the European Union, Marija Raus from ICMPD, Peter Emil Nielsen from the Danish Embassy, and Hans Machur from the Austrian Embassy, also addressed the gathering.\nDr. Sebastien Lorion, remarked that today marked a significant step forward in our shared commitment to safe and orderly migration. The opening of the FIA’s Risk Analysis Unit and Forensic Laboratory reflects the strength of our partnership with Pakistan in tackling irregular migration and enhancing border management, Dr. Lorion said.\nMarija Raus noted the importance of international partnerships with Denmark, Austria and the European Union to strengthen the FIA’s border management capacity. “The FIA can pursue an evidence-based, data driven approach to border management, implemented by officers with the right skills and tools in the right place,” she remarked.\nPeter Emil Nielsen, stressed the importance of border control being “not only effective but also fair, just, and respectful of human rights” and applauded the significant steps taken by ICMPD and the FIA to enhance the capacity in detection of travel document forgery and improve the overall border security in Pakistan.\nCharge d’Affaires of the Embassy of Austria in Pakistan, Hannes Machor, praised the FIA’s efforts to institutionalize the newly developed offices as a clear demonstration of Pakistan’s commitment to improve border management.",
