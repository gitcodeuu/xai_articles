I am confident that through this collaboration, we will achieve impactful results and make a lasting difference in the lives of our beneficiaries,” she said.\n“Children living in impoverished communities and households need to be prioritized when it comes to nutrition and social protection programmes to ensure they can survive, thrive, and reach their full potential,” UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil said.\n“WHO is honoured to partner with BISP to provide evidence-based interventions aimed at providing life-saving treatment to 75, 000 severely acute malnourished children with medical complications as well as protecting, supporting and promoting breast feeding as a key strategy to prevent stunting’, Dr. Luo Dapeng said.\n“This is a landmark event for BISP, marking a significant step forward in our efforts to enhance the wellbeing of our beneficiaries.
