The most lively and attention-grabbing zones, however, are undoubtedly the ASEAN Pavilions, Exhibition of Products from RCEP Countries and the Belt and Road International Pavilion, which feature unique and high-quality products from different countries and regions.\nIn addition to Pakistani crafts, durians from Southeast Asia were among the most popular products. Many booths featuring durian and durian-based products were packed with people. Especially in demand were Malaysia’s White Coffee of Musang King flavor, durian pastries, and durian egg rolls, which were highly sought after by Chinese buyers and achieved significant sales success.\n“The CAEXPO has made ‘durian freedom’ possible,” a visitor, who is a long-time fan of durians noted. In addition to durians, rice from Cambodia, rambutans from Indonesia, and bananas from the Philippines were also showcased, allowing visitors to experience the unique charm of different cultures.\nThe Belt and Road International Pavilion, which debuted at the 14th CAEXPO, has now become one of the most popular destinations. Pakistani gemstones, African handicrafts, Russian snacks and candies, Nepalese Thangka paintings, Polish amber jewelry, and Iranian home decor items were all highly sought-after, often drawing large crowds around the booths.\nAs an important platform driving economic and trade cooperation between China and ASEAN countries, the CAEXPO, attracting 1.3 million exhibitors and visitors in the past 20 years, has enabled more and more enterprises to ride in the express train of bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Since the first CAEXPO, China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation has been upgraded continuously.\nIn the first half of 2024, the total trade value between China and ASEAN reached 3.36 trillion yuan, an increase of 10.5 per cent. Over the same period, China’s total import and export value with Belt and Road countries reached 10.03 trillion yuan, up by 7.2 per cent.",
