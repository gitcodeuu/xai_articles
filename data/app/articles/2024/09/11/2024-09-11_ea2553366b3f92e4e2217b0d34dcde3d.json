We must improve access to climate data for at-risk communities,” he stated, highlighting that although technologies exist, scaling them effectively remains a challenge.\nThe disaster risk reduction should focus beyond preparedness and prevention, urging investment in planning and implementation, Dr. Pema Gyamtsho suggested.\nLt. Gen. Inam Haider Malik, Chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), also spoke at the event, emphasizing the alarming impact of warming on the glacial regions in the country.\nHe revealed that glacial melt in the Indus River basin was accelerating at a dangerous rate. He cited a 23.3% decrease in snow cover between November 2023 and April 2024 and an annual glacial melt rate of 3%, with an additional 16% mass loss over the past five years.\nThe NDMA chairman warned that while melting may provide temporary water surpluses, the long-term implications are dire and require urgent attention. He urged on the need for a regional approach to address the cryospheric crisis.\nSpecial remarks delivered by Ms. Aisha Humera Chaudhry, Acting Secretary of MoCC&EC emphasized on the need for making the cryosphere an integral part of the climate discourse in Pakistan.\nAhmed Kamal, Chairman of the Federal Flood Commission and Neelofur Hafeez, Joint Secretary of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MoNFS&R) highlighted the importance of interagency cooperation to tackle the multifaceted challenges of climate change.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
