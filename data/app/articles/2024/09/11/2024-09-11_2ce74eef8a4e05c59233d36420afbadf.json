  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 11 (APP): The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted permission to Dr Dinshaw, an accused in the fake bank accounts reference filed by the National Accountability Bureau, to travel abroad.\nA three-member bench headed by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail heard the case filed by Dr Dinshaw.\nThe court, in its order, observed that the petitioner could go abroad to participate in the wedding ceremony of his daughter. However, he would be bound to submit his passport to the trial court on his return after two months.\nDuring the hearing, the NAB prosecutor adopted the stance that the Bureau had no objection on travel of the accused abroad.\nHe further said that the reference against the accused might be shifted to another court after the restoration of amendments in the NAB law.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer Farouk H. Naek pleaded that Dr. Dinshaw had not misused the bail which was granted to him by the top court in 2021, and that he was ready to submit surety bonds for his travel abroad.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
