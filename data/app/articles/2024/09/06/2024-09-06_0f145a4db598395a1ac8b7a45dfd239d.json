  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 06 (APP):The Senate on Friday was informed that the country had the lowest research on medicine and drugs whereas the countries in the region were extensively investing in cutting-edge research on developing drugs from local salts and bringing innovation in pharmaceutical products.\nSenator Anousha Rehman in her supplementary query on Drug Regulatory Authority (DRAP)’s Central Research Fund (CRF) allocations and expenditure. She also sought a response on DRAP’s inquiry and investigation procedures’ double-checking mechanisms.\nSenator Danesh Kumar on his supplementary said Rs1.5 billion was allocated to DRAP in the past three years and its central research fund (CRF) amounted to Rs1.5 billion.\nMinister for Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar informed that basic changes were underway in DRAP about drug pricing and regulations.\n“The official inquiries if had stigmatized any party, I will take up the matter to the Coordinator Health Dr Mukhtar Bharat who is making a lot of efforts in the health sector to probe the matter,” he said.\n“As per 1976 allocation rules, one percent of the total amount is allocated for research, out of all the company’s total transactions in different pharmaceutical companies. The DRAP probed that no new requests for research came but the amount would not be wasted but rather would be accumulated in the fund with all bank interests,” Tarar said.\nHe added that there was very low research in the medicine and health sectors whereas regional countries were ahead of us and were researching their salts to produce medicines.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
