This brings the total number of cases in Islamabad to 85 from January 1 to September 5. A worrying statistic shared was the discovery of 419 dengue-positive larvae found across various locations within the last week.\nMeanwhile, between August 29 and September 4, 129 potential dengue hotspots were identified in Islamabad. The meeting also included a comparative analysis of dengue cases with other cities in the country.\nIn response to the rising cases, the DC Islamabad stressed the importance of enforcing anti-dengue Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Strict action was taken on  several violations.\nIn an action, AC Pothohar sealed four junkyards and a factory where dengue larvae were found. Additionally, four people were arrested for breaking anti-dengue protocols.\nFurther action was also taken against the management of Jammu and Kashmir Society, where consistent breaches of dengue prevention measures were reported. The management committee had been warned previously, but violations continued, leading to the arrest of its staff.\nThe DC called on citizens to cooperate with the district administration to implement dengue SOPs effectively, emphasizing that these measures were critical to controlling the spread of the disease. He warned that further violations of the SOPs would result in strong action, without exception.\nThe DC said that non-discriminatory enforcement of SOPs would be carried out to ensure the safety of all residents.
