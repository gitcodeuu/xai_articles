PERN has now been spread to 400+ HEIs with around 100 GB bandwidth.\nUnder the project, several mega IT initiatives for the sector are also launched including robust student information systems for public sector universities, state-of-the-art data centres and high-performance computing.\nSome notable project grant outcomes include 204 journal publications, 127 conference publications, 15 patents, 144 research events, seven spinoffs, 24 awards/recognition, 25 tech partnership licenses, and input for 17 policy-level developments.\nThe National Academy of Higher Education (NAHE), in addition to carrying out several capacity-building programmes, trained 196 women leaders across Pakistan, many of whom are now rising in the management cadres.
