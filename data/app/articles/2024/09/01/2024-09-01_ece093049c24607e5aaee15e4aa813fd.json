This transformation aligns with the Prime Minister’s vision of digitalization.\nThe “Model Digital City” project will enable residents to access 150 government services through a new City Super Application. This mobile app will facilitate a range of governmental and administrative services, including those from the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Islamabad Police, health services, and educational institutions. The aim is to encourage citizens to use the app for more efficient access to these services.\nThe app will also feature an e-parking facility, designed to streamline parking management and alleviate congestion in the city.\nThe project will include the installation of AI-integrated smart cameras across Islamabad. These cameras will play a vital role in monitoring street crime, enhancing security, and improving traffic management for residents and travellers alike.\nOfficials informed that Minister of State for IT and Telecommunication, Shaza Fatima Khawaja is of the view that digital transformation is key for the country’s development.
