  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 8 (APP):Militarization has badly affected students’ education in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nAccording to a report on International Literacy Day, today, education of IIOJK children disrupted due to decades-long unresolved Kashmir dispute as the students are being harassed and humiliated by Indian troops instead of making it easy for them to achieve education.\nIt said the Modi regime has banned hundreds of schools run by Falah-e-Aam Trust in the occupied territory to keep Kashmiri youth away from quality education.\nThe Modi regime’s new education policy in IIOJK is a reflection of RSS ideology, the report said, adding how can Kashmiri students pay attention to education when they are witnessing killings of their dear ones by Indian troops on a daily basis?\nThe report deplored that Muslim students were forced to sing Hindu religious songs and do ‘Surya Namaskar’ in IIOJK schools.\nIt said off and on internet suspensions by Indian authorities have immensely hit education in the occupied territory and the Kashmiri students are harassed in mainland India and are even expelled from educational institutions.\nThe report appealed to the international community to pay attention to the plight of students in IIOJK so that they could also get education.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
