Have they gone to some other country or another place ?”, he remarked.\nHe stated that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf had to resort to fake videos to give the impression of huge rally and uploaded false and fake posts on social media to cover up thun attendance.\nHe said that the PTI was spreading lies and propaganda on social media by sharing old videos of rallies from Kashmir and even Indian Punjab farmers’ foot-ages.\nHe made it clear that the PTI leadership could not escape accountability by such tactics. He said PTI founder chairman will have to face trial for corrupt practices.\nThe PTI leadership will be held accountable for Tosha Khana fraud, £190 million embezzlement scam, which was biggest corruption case in Pakistan’s history.\nHe remarked that the PTI’s leadership both in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had completely failed to bring convoys to the public rally. Taking a jibe at the PTI he said:”Tabdeeli Ka Jazba, Tabdeeli ka Janoon, Inna Lillahi wa Anna Ilay Rajiyun.”",
