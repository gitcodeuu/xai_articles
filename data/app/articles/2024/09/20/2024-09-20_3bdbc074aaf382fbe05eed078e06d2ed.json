During the session, Power Division officials provided an update on renewable energy projects, noting that 5,000 MW of renewable energy is currently under construction, with plans to add 15,000 to 19,000 MW of hydropower to the grid.\nSenator Marri stressed that this information should be readily available to the Ministry of Climate Change and directed that it be presented at COP. She also called for the Secretary of the Power Division to participate in future meetings.\nThe Secretary of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination mentioned that Pakistan is the third-largest importer of solar energy, yet the Ministry lacks comprehensive data on solar energy’s contribution to the energy grid. She underscored the importance of obtaining accurate data to present at COP.\nSenator Manzoor Ahmed raised concerns about the devastation caused by climate change in Balochistan, questioning whether the Ministry has any relief programs for the affected population.\nHe highlighted the destruction of homes, displacement of residents, and the collapse of the agricultural system. He further requested detailed information on the Ministry’s collaborations with NGOs and other agencies in the region and inquired about the progress and strategy for the Green Balochistan initiative. The committee was informed that 39 agreements have been signed, and work with various NGOs is ongoing.\nThe Ministry further discussed that a financial model for the Electric Vehicles Policy is being developed in collaboration with banks. The Electric Vehicles Policy is expected to reduce environmental pollution.\nSenator Manzoor Ahmed sought data on melting glaciers, to which officials responded that glaciers in Pakistan remain stable, while those in India are melting. Climate Change officials also emphasized the rising temperatures in Pakistan due to climate change and reported that two million people in Sindh live in vulnerable, flood-prone areas.\nIn line with the recommendations from 31st July 2024, the IWMB and CDA coordinated to implement SOPs for the weekly bazaar. These SOPs included provisions for the availability of items at night and emergency supplies at the G6 bazaar.\nAdditionally, joint activities involved the restoration of the landscape at Pir Sohawa, as well as efforts to improve cleanliness and regulate hunting and wood cutting in Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP).\nIn response to the decision regarding the Establishment Division’s plan to create a dedicated occupational group for Climate Change within the civil service, the Secretary of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination (MoCC) proposed hiring candidates initially on a contract basis, followed by recruitment from a fresh talent pool.\nThe Establishment Division affirmed that the Ministry’s proposed scale and policy would be taken into consideration.",
