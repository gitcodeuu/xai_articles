The illegal alteration of the demography of Indian Illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir by India blatantly violates UN resolutions, they deplored.\nThe UN has a responsibility to initiate the process of restoring the Kashmiris’ inalienable right to self-determination and must intervene to prevent India from changing the demographic composition of IIOJK, they stressed.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
