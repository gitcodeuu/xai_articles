However, other provinces and Gilgit-Baltistan have not yet transferred land. The minister said a company has also been registered under green initiatives. Under the plan, 40 per cent revenue each would be given to the respective province and investors while remaining 20 per cent revenue would be purely specified for research and development (R&D) in this sector.\nHe said required irrigation water for the scheme would be provided from share of the respective province. Around 400,000 acres command area would come under the Cholistan scheme in Punjab, he said.\nHe said the project would cost Rs 211 billion under which 296 kilometer long canal would be constructed. It would consist of 176 km long Cholistan Canal and 120 km Marur Canal, he added.\nHe categorically said that water distribution in the said canals would be purely met through the share of respective provinces and Indus River System Authority (IRSA) would issue proper certificate in this regard.\nThe Cholistan Canal would get water for four months from share of Punjab province while for 2 months it would feed through flood water, he said. Responding to a point raised by Syed Naveed Qamar, the minister said the federal government could not ask from the provinces about their water share distribution in their respective provinces after the 18th constitutional amendment.\nHe went on to say that two provinces- Punjab and Sindh have signed agreement so far and identified land for the said scheme under Green Pakistan Initiative. Musadik Malik said that telemetry system was being installed on water distribution system which would completely address reservation of provinces in judicious water distribution as per the water accord.\nHe said the project mainly aimed at enhancing per acre yield through drip irrigation, tunnel farming and productive farming which required massive investment.
