Their counsel submitted exemption applications and requested the court to exempt his clients from personal appearance for one day, which was accordingly accepted by the court. The court also accepted the exemption applications of Asad Umar and Fawad Chaudhry, exempting them from personal appearance for one day.\nThe accused had filed bail applications fearing arrest in the Jinnah House attack case related to the May 9 riots. The Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking Jinnah House (also known as the residence of the Corps Commander Lahore) during the May 9 riots.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
