The reforms are designed to serve the larger interest of the country,” he added.\nBarrister Aqeel made it clear that the powers of the Supreme Court were not being curtailed. The apex court would continue to work independently, and the introduction of constitutional courts was meant to help reduce the backlog of cases, ensuring that the common man did not face unnecessary delays in getting justice, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
