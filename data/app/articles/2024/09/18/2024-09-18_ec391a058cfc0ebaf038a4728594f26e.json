He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to provide moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people till the realization of their right to self-determination.The delegation apprised the president about the atrocities being committed by the Modi regime in the IIOJK. It was highlighted that the entire Kashmiri leadership had been imprisoned to suppress the voice of the Kashmiri people.The delegation also apprised the president about the issues of the refugees in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).The president underscored that a protest should be lodged over the illegal steps and atrocities being committed by the Indian occupation forces in the IIOJK.He said that Pakistan was committed to the socio-economic uplift of refugees and resolving their issues.He assured the delegation that the AJK Government would be asked to enhance subsistence allowance as well as provide other relief measures to the Kashmiri refugees.He further assured that Pakistan’s social safety net would be extended to include 8,000 migrant families under the Benazir Income Support Programme.The delegation thanked the president for Pakistan’s continued moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people.They also commended the efforts and role of Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who strongly advocated the cause of the people of IIOJK at various fora during his tenure as the Foreign Minister of Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
