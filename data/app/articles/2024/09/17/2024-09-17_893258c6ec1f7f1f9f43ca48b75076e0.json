It is a unique chance to bridge divides and find paths toward lasting peace.\nConflicts increase greenhouse gas emissions and ravage the environment, polluting soil, water, and air. The devastation of ecosystems and pollution caused by conflicts worsens climate change and undermines our efforts to safeguard the planet,” the SDPI Executive Director said.\nHe added that the climate talks should be coalescing, with all giving undivided attention and cooperation. “We call on everyone to observe the COP Truce during the month of COP29. Let the COP Truce serve as a symbol of human solidarity.\nLet’s unite for a safer, more prosperous, and sustainable future for all. Only by prioritizing peace and climate action can we ensure a liveable planet for future generations,” he said while highlighting the global appeal under COP29 Truce.\nThe COP Truce initiative is inspired by the Olympic Truce as in 1992, the International Olympic Committee requested all states to comply with the truce during the Olympic Games. The UN also endorsed the truce by passing a resolution in 1993 and reinforcing the call to honor the truce.\nCOP Truce Initiative will envisage halting military operations akin to the Olympic Truce beginning a week before the commencement and concluding ceremonies of COPs. The key reasons leading to the initiative were limiting greenhouse gas emissions and environmental damage, and highlighting the non-political, unifying, and peaceful nature of combatting climate change agenda.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
