The proposed changes are designed to enhance the overall efficiency of the judiciary,” he said.\nHe said that nearly 90 amendments were being developed in collaboration with the Law Minister, focusing particularly on improving the functioning of the lower courts.\nHe said that these amendments aim to address fundamental issues faced by the average citizen.\n“The common man’s concern is not constitutional interpretation but the timely delivery of justice,” he remarked.\n“Our goal is to ensure that the legal system works efficiently for all, especially when it comes to providing speedy justice.”\nHe said that these reforms were part of the government’s ongoing efforts to overhaul the legal framework and ensure a more accessible and equitable justice system for all citizens.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
