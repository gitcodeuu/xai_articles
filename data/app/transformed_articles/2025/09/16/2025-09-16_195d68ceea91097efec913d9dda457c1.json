    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 16 (APP):Zong, Pakistan's leading digital technology innovation company, has partnered with Alkhidmat Foundation to donate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to their healthcare institutions in Lahore and Islamabad. The initiative reflects Zong's commitment to inclusive growth, ensuring that critical resources are redirected to strengthen community health and wellbeing. Through this collaboration, protective gear is being directed to frontline healthcare workers in under-resourced facilities, equipping doctors, diagnostic teams, and surgical staff with essential items that reinforce safety standards and minimise waste. The initiative also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Good Health & Well-being (SDG 3) and Responsible Consumption & Production (SDG 12). Commenting on the initiative, Andleeb Aslam, Official Spokesperson at Zong, said: \"At Zong, Inclusive Growth means enabling communities through meaningful support. This collaboration with Alkhidmat Foundation reflects our commitment to social responsibility by ensuring healthcare workers have the protection they need to continue serving on the frontlines. Through initiatives like this, we strive to make a lasting difference where it matters most.\" This donation builds on Zong's ongoing partnership with Alkhidmat Foundation, which has previously delivered healthcare services to over 3,000 patients in Sindh through Mobile Health Units and is currently extending relief to flood-affected communities. Together, both organisations are driving community upliftment by improving access to and support for healthcare across Pakistan.",
