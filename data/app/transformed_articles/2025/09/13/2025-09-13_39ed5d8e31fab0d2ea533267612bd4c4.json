The PPAF has set a target of enrolling and providing financial assistance to more than 2 million people in the ongoing financial year 2025-26. The fundamental purpose of PPAF programs is to address poverty, malnutrition, and illiteracy. The Benazir Nashunuma Program aims to tackle malnutrition by providing specialized food, health education, and financial support to pregnant and lactating women as well as children under two. The Benazir Kafaalat Program provides unconditional cash transfers to the poorest women by ensuring financial inclusion through bank accounts and promoting women's empowerment. The Benazir Taleemi Wazaif Program supports children from low-income families by offering conditional cash stipends linked with school attendance, helping to reduce dropout rates and encourage education. The Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) is a non-profit company set up by the Government of Pakistan in 2000 as the main national institution to support poverty reduction programs across the country. The Fund has addressed multidimensional poverty by providing economic productive assets, skill enhancement, access to finance, and business support to ultra-poor and vulnerable poor households.",
