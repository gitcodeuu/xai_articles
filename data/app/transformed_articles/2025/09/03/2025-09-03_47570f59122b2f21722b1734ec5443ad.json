The lawyer of accused, Mazhar Iqbal Sidhu, took the stance during the hearing that the accused wanted to surrender after the bail was rejected. The prosecutor took the stand that the ANF was an independent force. Justice Hassan Azhar noted that 10 kg of drugs and a drone were also recovered from the accused. The accused withdrew the application after observations were made to reject the bail application. The Supreme Court included the arrest of the accused in the court order. The Supreme Court had rejected pre-arrest bail of accused Fayyaz Alias Bhola in drug smuggling case. A case of drug smuggling was registered against the accused in Lahore in August 2023.",
