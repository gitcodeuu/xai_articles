    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 03 (APP):Charge d'Affaires (CDA) Natalie Baker emphasized Pakistan's potential as a dynamic investment destination during a webinar hosted by the Business Council for International Understanding (BCIU) the other day. The session brought together American and Pakistani business leaders, along with representatives from financial institutions, to discuss Pakistan's evolving economic landscape and reform agenda. Commending the Sharif government's efforts to stabilize the economy and foster an investor-friendly environment, CDA Baker underscored the opportunities for U.S. companies to play a pivotal role in supporting Pakistan's long-term growth. \"Pakistan is the fifth largest country in the world, home to 250 million people, with 64 percent of the population under the age of 30. It represents one of the world's largest and youngest consumer markets,\" Baker noted. \"Pakistan's GDP stands at $412 billion, ranking 38th globally, but projections by Goldman Sachs suggest it could grow to $3.3 trillion by 2050, positioning it among the top 10 to 15 economies worldwide.\" She highlighted several sectors primed for U.S. investment, including critical minerals, information and communications technology, agriculture, energy, and infrastructure development. Baker also encouraged American companies to partner with the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service team at U.S. Mission Pakistan and explore joint ventures with local counterparts. \"Let's seize this moment to create profitable opportunities for U.S. businesses, contribute to shared economic prosperity, and strengthen the bonds between our two nations,\" she concluded.",
