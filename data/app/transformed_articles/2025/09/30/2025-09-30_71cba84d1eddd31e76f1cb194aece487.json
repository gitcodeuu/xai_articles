    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 30 (APP): Acting President, Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on Tuesday condemned the tragic suicide bombing in Quetta, denouncing it as a cowardly act of terrorism and a direct attack on Pakistan's peace and stability. In a statement from the Presidency, Acting President Gilani said, \"This brutal and cowardly act of terrorism is an assault on the country's peace and the will of its people. Such actions will never shake our national resolve.\" He paid tribute to the brave security personnel who laid down their lives in the line of duty, stating, \"The nation takes immense pride in the sacrifices made by our courageous security forces. Their commitment and valor continue to inspire us.\" Gilani emphasized that Pakistan's enemies would never succeed in their sinister objectives. \"Those who conspire against Pakistan will meet a humiliating end. The terrorists and their facilitators, especially the so-called 'Khawarij', will face justice,\" he asserted. He further warned against foreign-backed elements, particularly those allegedly supported by India, stating, \"The unrest fueled by the Khawarij under Indian patronage cannot weaken the spirit of the Pakistani nation.\" Acting President Gilani concluded, \"The entire nation and state institutions are united in the mission to eradicate terrorism. Together, we will defeat every threat to our homeland.\"",
