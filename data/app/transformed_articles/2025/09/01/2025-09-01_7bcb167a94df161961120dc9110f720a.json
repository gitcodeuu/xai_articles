Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi heard the post-arrest bail petition of ex-chairman PARC in illegal recruitment case. The petitioneras lawyer argued that there is no allegation of corruption against my client. The department had requested for additional recruitment, he said.

Former chairman recruited his own relative, he said, adding that 332 people were recruited against 168 posts. The AAG argued that a member of the interview committee also recruited his daughter.
