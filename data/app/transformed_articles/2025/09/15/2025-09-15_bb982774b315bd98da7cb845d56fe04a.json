The development came during a meeting between Kazakhstanas Ambassador, Yerzhan Kistafin, and Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, at CDA Headquarters on Monday. Chairman Randhawa emphasized the need to formalize Sister City relations between Islamabad and Astana, noting that enhanced collaboration could boost cultural, environmental, and tourism links. aCooperation between Islamabad and Astana at the city level should be enhanced so that Sister City relations can be formally established,a he said. Ambassador Kistafin praised CDAas ongoing efforts to improve and beautify Islamabad, and proposed a significant cultural gesture: naming a major road in Astana after Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah as a symbol of friendship. In return, he suggested Islamabad name a prominent road after Kazakhstanas renowned poet Abai Qunanbaiuly, further cementing literary and cultural ties. Randhawa also briefed the ambassador on Islamabadas eco-friendly initiative, the aGardenia Huba project, describing it as a model nursery that would anot only help make the city green but also nurture a spirit of love for plantation among citizens.a He added that development and beautification work in the Diplomatic Enclave was underway, including upgraded sports and recreational facilities for diplomats. At the conclusion of the meeting, both sides expressed a shared resolve to strengthen cooperation in culture, environment, and urban development, with a focus on long-term city-to-city partnerships.",
