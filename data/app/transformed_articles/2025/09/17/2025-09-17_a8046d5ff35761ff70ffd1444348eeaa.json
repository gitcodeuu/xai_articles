    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 17 (APP):In a significant step towards preserving Pakistan's academic and institutional memory through varsity-level archiving initiative, the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Archives of Pakistan (NAP) at a formal ceremony held at the NUST Central Library. The event was attended by Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, as the chief guest, alongside senior officials from the Cabinet Division. Being integrated with NUST Archive at the university's central library, the milestone initiative has set a new precedent for university-level archiving by formally establishing a framework to preserve, digitise, and curate institutional records. The event also marked the inauguration of the \"Quaid Corner\", a dedicated space within the Central Library showcasing rare archival materials, photographs, and documents related to Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, generously provided by the National Archives of Pakistan. This space will serve as a symbolic and academic resource for students, researchers, and faculty, connecting them with the ideological roots and foundational vision of the country. Sharing his views at the event, NUST Pro-Rector Academics, Dr. Osman Hasan, said that archives are not merely storage facilities, but also living repositories of national memory, vital for research, policymaking, and institutional continuity. He maintained that the joint initiative between NUST and NAP is poised to serve as a solid foundation for future academic research, curriculum development, public discourse on governance and national development. It is pertinent to mention that NUST Archive Section serves as a central point for preserving the university's intellectual legacy. NUST School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) has also reinforced the project through providing technical expertise in digitisation, metadata structuring, and quality assurance of archival content.",
