    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 17 (APP):Pakistan and Palestine have taken a significant step to expand bilateral relations in the health sector by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Islamabad. The agreement was signed by Federal Minister for Health, Syed Mustafa Kamal, on behalf of Pakistan, while the Palestinian Ambassador represented his government at the ceremony. Senior officials, including Federal Health Secretary Hamid Yaqoob, Additional Secretary Health, and the Director General Health, also attended the event. Their presence highlighted the importance attached by both sides to the new partnership. According to the Ministry of National Health Services, the MoU is designed to enhance collaboration in advanced medical fields, professional training, and joint research. The move is expected to create long-term avenues for strengthening healthcare systems in both countries. Federal Minister Mustafa Kamal announced that a Pakistan-Palestine Health Working Group will be established within the next 30 days. This body will supervise the implementation of the MoU and ensure that agreed initiatives are carried out effectively. He explained that cooperation will cover a broad spectrum of medical specialties. These include interventional cardiology, organ transplant, orthopedic surgery, endoscopic ultrasound, burn treatment, and plastic surgery. Pakistan will also assist Palestine in strengthening expertise in infectious diseases, ophthalmology, pharmaceuticals, and collaborative medical research. Training opportunities for Palestinian health professionals at Pakistan's premier medical institutions are part of the plan. \"The purpose of this agreement is to foster closer collaboration for improving the health and well-being of the people of both brotherly nations,\" Minister Kamal said. \"The hearts of the people of Pakistan beat with Palestine, and we stand ready to assist our Palestinian brothers and sisters in every possible way.\" The Palestinian Ambassador welcomed the initiative and extended gratitude to the Government of Pakistan. He noted that Palestine highly values Pakistan's unwavering support in political, humanitarian, and now medical spheres. \"Palestine and Pakistan are brotherly countries. Together, we will work for the improvement of health and well-being of our peoples,\" he remarked. Officials stressed that the agreement is not limited to symbolic gestures but represents a practical roadmap for cooperation. By enabling exchange of knowledge and expertise, it is expected to directly benefit the healthcare sectors of both nations. The MoU underscores Pakistan's consistent support for Palestine, extending it beyond politics to the vital domain of public health.
