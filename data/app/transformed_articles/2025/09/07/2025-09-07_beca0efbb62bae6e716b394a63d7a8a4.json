    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 07 (APP): The Climate Action Forum (CAF), in collaboration with the Ministry of Climate Change, here on Sunday organized a plantation drive at Trail 7 in Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) as part of the Prime Minister of Pakistan's \"Aik Beti, Aik Shajar\" initiative. The campaign, backed by key local partners-including the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB), Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), aims to foster environmental stewardship and inspire active community participation through tree plantation initiatives. During the activity, a degraded patch at the base of Trail 7 was restored with the plantation of 100 indigenous trees, said a press release on Sunday. The drive brought together a wide spectrum of participants, nearly 100 people, including students, academia, government representatives, NGOs, INGOs, Rural Support Programmes, and all CAF member organizations, reflecting the true spirit of collaborative climate action. The event was graced by Dr. Roomi S. Hayat, Chairperson CAF and Sakhawat Ali, Director IWMB, along with senior executives from partner organizations, whose participation underscored the importance of collective responsibility in protecting biodiversity and reviving ecosystems. This initiative represented another significant step in restoring natural habitats, safeguarding biodiversity and preserving the ecological beauty of Margalla Hills National Park for future generations. The CAF Secretariat at the Institute of Rural Management (IRM), extends its gratitude to all participating organizations whose contribution made this campaign a success. These organizations include the Rural Support Programmes Network, Balochistan Rural Support Programme (BRSP), Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP), National Rural Support Programme (NRSP), Secours Islamique France, Human Resource Development Network (HRDN), Trust for Voluntary Organizations (TVO), Recharge Pakistan (WWF), State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Iqra University (Islamabad Campus), Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) and Ghazi Barotha Traqiati Idara (GBTI), among others.",
