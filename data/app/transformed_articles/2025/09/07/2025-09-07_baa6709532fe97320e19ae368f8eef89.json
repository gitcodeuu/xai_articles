    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 07 (APP): Pakistan and China have signed nine Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) to deepen cooperation in the field of information technology during the second Pakistan-China B2B Conference held in China. Three standout agreements were signed in G2B and B2B with Huawei Technologies, said a news release. The first MoU between Huawei Technologies and NTC Pakistan aims to accelerate fiberization and enhance secure government connectivity infrastructure. This partnership will play a critical role in modernising Pakistan's digital landscape and ensuring robust, high-speed communication across public sector institutions. This program will be rolled out across 15 universities in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission (HEC), reinforcing Huawei's role in building Pakistan's digital future. Huawei signed another MoU with NAVTTC to launch a specialised AI and cybersecurity training program for youth. This initiative will equip 1,500 participants with globally recognised certifications in Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G Technologies, supporting the Prime Minister's \"Skills for Productive Employment\" vision. Huawei also partnered with Sky4,7, Pakistan's first purpose-built, AI-ready sovereign cloud data centre, designed to anchor the country's digital infrastructure. This collaboration will enable secure cloud services, scalable AI deployments, and compliance with Pakistan's Cloud First Policy, ensuring data residency and digital sovereignty. Other MoUs signed at the conference included collaborations with Alibaba International Digital Commerce, China Submarine Cable Construction Company Limited (CSCC), GuoDong Group and the Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) with Shanghai Lingang International Data Industry Institute (SHLID). These agreements mark a major milestone in the Pakistan-China digital partnership, unlocking new avenues for innovation, investment, and human capital development",
