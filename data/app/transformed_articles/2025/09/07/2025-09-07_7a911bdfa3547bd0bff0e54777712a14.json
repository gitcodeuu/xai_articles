He said that on September 7, 1965, the falcons of the PAF shattered the enemyas arrogance in the skies and inscribed a new chapter of history. aWe salute the heroes of 1965 who successfully defended our aerial frontiers,a he added. Naqvi recalled that the PAF defeated the enemyas numerical superiority with spirit, skill and absolute faith, setting a glorious example of valor. He particularly highlighted the legendary feat of Squadron Leader M.M. Alam, who stunned the world by downing five enemy aircraft in a matter of moments. Referring to recent events, the interior minister noted that six decades after the 1965 war, in May 2025, Pakistan once again crushed the enemyas pride when PAF falcons shot down six hostile fighter jets in a historic encounter. He emphasized that the pilots, engineers, and technicians of the Pakistan Air Force are the nationas greatest asset, bearing the responsibility of safeguarding the countryas skies with honor and dedication. aEvery Pakistani is proud of these sons of the soil, their supreme sacrifices, unwavering courage, and high resolve.
