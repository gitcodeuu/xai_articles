The event was arranged under the auspices of the National Heritage and Culture Division. The evening was filled with devotion and reverence, celebrating the birth of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), whose teachings of love, compassion and tolerance continue to inspire humanity. The event aimed to spread the message of peace, brotherhood, and spiritual harmony while rekindling the eternal bond of love for the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). Renowned Sufi qawwals Nadeem Salamat and Masood Salamat mesmerized the audience with their soulful renditions of Sufi and naat-based poetry, creating an atmosphere of deep spiritual reflection. The audience responded with great enthusiasm, immersing themselves in the blessings of zikr-e-Rasool (Peace Be Upon Him).
