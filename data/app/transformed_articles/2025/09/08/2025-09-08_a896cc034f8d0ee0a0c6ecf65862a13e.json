    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, September 08 (APP):The Education Council of Dawat-e-Islami is hosting the 1500 Milad Celebrations and Annual Award Ceremony 2024-25 on Tuesday, 9th September 2025, at the Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad. This event will, for the first time, bring together its three leading educational institutions including Dar-ul-Madinah International Islamic School System, Kanz-ul-Madaris Board and Dar-ul-Madina International University on a single, grand stage. The ceremony is a dual celebration, combining a reverent commemoration of the Milad of our Beloved Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) with a prestigious award ceremony honouring the top academic achievers from the Dar-ul-Madinah Schools and Kanz-ul-Madaris Board. The event is expected to draw a high-level audience of government dignitaries, foreign diplomats, esteemed academics and community leaders from across the globe. \"This event is a manifestation of our collective mission to nurture a generation of leaders who are not only intellectually brilliant but are also spiritually grounded and morally upright,\" said Junaid Attari Madani, President of the Education Council. \"It is a celebration of our profound spiritual heritage and the bright future embodied by our exceptional students.\" The ceremony will feature keynote addresses from Maulana Muhammad Imran Attari, Head of the Central Executive Council of Dawat-e-Islami, and the renowned Islamic Scholar Mufti Muhammad Qasim Attari. Their speeches are anticipated to focus on the themes of faith, knowledge and the role of education in building a compassionate and progressive society. This historic gathering will help project a unified, professional, and globally-minded brand image for all three participating institutions, reinforcing Dawat-e-Islami's position as a leader in modern, faith-based education. The Education Council of Dawat-e-Islami is the central governing body responsible for the strategic oversight of Dawat-e-Islami's global educational ecosystem. It is committed to providing high-quality, contemporary academic education that is seamlessly interwoven with a deep spiritual and ethical foundation.",
