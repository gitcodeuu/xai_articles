    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 23 (APP): Advisor to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad on Tuesday said the World Bank's update, including the note \"Global Poverty Lines: What it Means for Pakistan\" reaffirmed that the national poverty line remained the most relevant benchmark for policymaking. \"This update clarifies earlier confusion: the higher international poverty rates recently cited were the result of a technical recalibration of global methodology and per-day dollar thresholds, not a sudden rise in poverty in Pakistan,\" he said on the official platform, X. Based on the latest official Household Survey (2018-19), 21.9% of the population lived below the national Cost-of-Basic-Needs line. The World Bank's own assessment, he said, underscored that while international poverty lines were useful for cross-country comparisons, Pakistan's national line must continue to guide domestic policy, social protection and poverty reduction efforts. The advisor said poverty levels have indeed faced setbacks in recent years, largely due to extraordinary shocks such as COVID-19, floods, and macroeconomic stress. These challenges, which also affected many other developing countries, are being addressed through targeted actions. Elaborating Pakistan's measures, he said, the government had expanded the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), scaled up emergency cash transfers during crises, and continued to invest in job creation, agriculture, and small businesses to support sustainable livelihoods. In addition, Khurram said, a number of targeted programs to alleviate poverty were underway at the federal level, including the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, Workers' Welfare Fund, and Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal, among others. He said provinces also have their own dedicated poverty reduction and social protection programs underway, recognizing that this is a national challenge requiring coordinated action across all tiers of government. At the same time, the advisor said, work was underway to make subsidies more targeted and equitable, strengthen social protection systems, and expand investment in health and education to build human capital. \"These priorities are aligned with the broader reform agenda, ensuring that Pakistan not only cushions vulnerable households against shocks but also creates the conditions for inclusive and sustained poverty reduction,\" he remarked.",
