    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 23 (APP): Telenor Pakistan has announced a contribution of Rs. 58 million to support nationwide flood relief and rehabilitation efforts, reaffirming its longstanding resolve to stand with the nation in times of crisis. The contribution included a cash donation of Rs. 10 million to Al Khidmat Foundation, enabling immediate relief through the provision of life-saving nutrition, medicines and hygiene packs in severely affected areas. This amount comprises voluntary contributions from Telenor Pakistan employees, as well as funds from the company itself. In addition to financial assistance, Telenor is also providing in-kind services as part of its overall contribution. Recognising connectivity as a lifeline during emergencies, Telenor Pakistan has facilitated free calls in flood-affected areas to support rescue and emergency operations. The company has also deployed additional resources to ensure uninterrupted network services, helping families and communities stay connected during these challenging times. Fridtjof Rusten, CEO of Telenor Pakistan, said: \"The devastation caused by the recent floods is heartbreaking, and our deepest sympathies are with all those affected. When lives and livelihoods are disrupted, collective action becomes imperative. At Telenor Pakistan, we are focused on supporting communities to find resilience in adversity, ensuring connectivity when it matters most, and contributing meaningfully to the rebuilding of lives and hope for the future.\" Telenor Pakistan has a proud tradition of standing by the people of Pakistan in moments of need. From the devastating 2005 earthquake and the floods of 2010 and 2022, to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has consistently contributed through financial aid and in-kind support. This latest contribution underscores Telenor Pakistan's unwavering commitment to social responsibility and its resolve to play an active role in relief and recovery initiatives that help rebuild lives and communities.",
