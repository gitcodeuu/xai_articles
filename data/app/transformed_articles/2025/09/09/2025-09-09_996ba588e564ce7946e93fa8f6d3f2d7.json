    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 9 (APP):The District and Sessions Court of Islamabad on Tuesday extended the interim bail of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and his wife Bushra Bibi in multiple cases, granting them protection from arrest until October 7. Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the cases and ordered that the PTI founder's bail in six cases and Bushra Bibi's bail in one case will remain in place until the next hearing. The court extended protection from arrest for the PTI founder in cases linked to the May 9 incidents, an attempted murder case, and protest-related charges. Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi's interim bail was extended in the Toshakhana case, where she faces allegations of submitting forged receipts. During today's proceedings, the court did not issue a final ruling on Bushra Bibi's bail pleas, while arguments on the PTI founder's applications could not be completed. The judge observed that a joint verdict on both applications Advocate Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry represented the PTI founder during the hearing. The court noted that he faces cases registered at several police stations, including Tarnol, Karachi Company, and Kohsar, among others. The court adjourned further proceedings and scheduled the next hearing for October 7. Until then, both the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi remain on interim bail, shielding them from immediate arrest in the mentioned cases.",
