Each truck carried multiple ration bags, weighing 46 kilograms each and packed with 22 essential food items to support displaced families. This initiative is part of NDMA's ongoing efforts to provide timely humanitarian assistance in coordination with provincial authorities. Relief operations continue across Punjab through the mobilization of national resources, with active support from the private sector and industries.
