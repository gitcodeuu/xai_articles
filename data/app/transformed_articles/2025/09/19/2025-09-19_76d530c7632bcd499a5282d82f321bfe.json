    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 19 (APP):Plans for a modern, high-speed train service connecting Islamabad and Rawalpindi have moved a step closer, as the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Pakistan Railways prepare to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to formally launch the project. The decision came during a meeting held at CDA Headquarters on Friday, chaired by Chairman CDA and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa. The meeting, attended by senior officials from both CDA and Pakistan Railways, reviewed the draft MoU and discussed key aspects of the project, including the proposed route, layout plan, business model, and the use of eco-friendly technology. Randhawa said the train service would help ease traffic congestion across the twin cities, which are often choked by rising vehicle numbers. \"The completion of this project will significantly reduce the overall traffic flow in Islamabad and Rawalpindi,\" he said, adding that the train will be integrated with feeder electric bus services to improve accessibility for commuters. The chairman emphasized that the service would be affordable, safe, and comfortable, while adhering to international standards and best practices. \"This train service will be a gift for the people of the twin cities,\" Randhawa remarked, stressing its role not only in providing modern transport facilities but also in boosting the overall development of the capital.",
