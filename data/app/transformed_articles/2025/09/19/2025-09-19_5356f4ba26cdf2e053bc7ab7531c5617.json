    "article_body": "BEIJING, Sep 19: The 12th Beijing Xiangshan Forum opened at the Beijing International Convention Center, featuring a new section called \"High-end Dialogues.\" The dialogue brought together experts and scholars from China and abroad, highlighting the forum's role as a high-level platform for international exchanges. During an interview session, Mustafa Mahdi Al-Ramah, president of the Iraqi Defense University for Military Studies, praised China's achievements in infrastructure and education. He expressed hopes for stronger cooperation with China, saying: \"If participating countries are willing to move toward the outcomes of such meetings, I believe they will be effective.\" Held under the theme \"Upholding International Order and Promoting Peaceful Development,\" the forum addresses pressing global security challenges and reflects its forward-looking orientation, CGTN reported on Friday. Representatives from developed nations, emerging powers, small and medium-sized countries, as well as conflict-affected regions are in attendance. Compared with previous years, the number of former senior political and military dignitaries and prominent experts has risen significantly, making the forum more diverse, representative, and balanced, and fully reflecting its openness and inclusiveness. Pan Qinghua, one of the participants, said the forum provides a meaningful opportunity for open dialogue. \"Being able to share perspectives and seek common ground at the forum helps avoid conflict and promote balance,\" he said.",
