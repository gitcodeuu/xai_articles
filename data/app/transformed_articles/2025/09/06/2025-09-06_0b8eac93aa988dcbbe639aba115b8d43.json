He added that the life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is the best example of compassion, justice, and tolerance, which must serve as guiding principles for society today. Sardar Yasir Ilyas noted that following the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) could help overcome divisions, foster unity and ensure peace at home and abroad. \"If we walk on the path shown by the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), we can build a society rooted in mutual respect, harmony, and equality,\" he said. Meanwhile, Managing Director of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC), Aftab ur Rehman Rana, said that the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal marks the blessed day when the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) came into this world.
