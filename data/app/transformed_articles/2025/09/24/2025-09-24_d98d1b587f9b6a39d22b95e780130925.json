    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 24 (APP):In a significant diplomatic development, the Russian Federation has officially confirmed its participation in the upcoming Inter-Parliamentary Speakers Conference (ISC), a pioneering event being hosted in Islamabad to foster global unity through parliamentary dialogue. The confirmation follows an invitation extended by the ISC Committee, said a news release issued here Wednesday. The conference, described as \"first and unique in its nature\", is gaining strong international momentum. According to Misbah Khar, Ambassador to the ISC and a key organizer, the foremost agenda items include faith, interfaith harmony, and addressing the pressing global challenge of climate change. \"This conference is not just a diplomatic gathering; it is a global call for peace, cooperation, and collective climate action,\" said Misbah. \"We are bringing together voices from across continents, cultures, and faiths, with 45 member countries already confirmed. Russia's participation, as a key international player, carries special significance in building bridges and promoting enduring bilateral and multilateral cooperation.\" Russia will be represented by one of its most prominent and internationally engaged Deputy Speakers, a figure widely respected for their commitment to diplomacy and inter-parliamentary collaboration. This high-level participation underscores the importance Moscow places on strengthening multilateral cooperation through parliamentary diplomacy. A senior official from the Senate Protocol welcomed Russia's confirmation, noting that the ISC stands apart in its uniqueness, as it brings together both houses of parliament along with senior representatives from across the globe under one roof. \"Russia's presence enhances the credibility and impact of this landmark initiative,\" the official added. The ISC is being recognized internationally for its inclusive and visionary approach. With 45 member states already committed, the Islamabad conference is poised to become a defining moment in inter-parliamentary collaboration, highlighting the role of legislatures in promoting peace, tolerance, and sustainable development. The Senate Secretariat confirms that preparations are well underway to ensure the event is organized at the highest diplomatic and professional standards. Innovative formats, thematic sessions, and high-level bilateral meetings are planned, reflecting Pakistan's leadership in facilitating meaningful global dialogue. The Inter-Parliamentary Speakers Conference will serve as a powerful reminder that while governments negotiate, it is parliaments that connect people and this initiative marks a decisive step toward shared understanding, resilience, and global solidarity.",
