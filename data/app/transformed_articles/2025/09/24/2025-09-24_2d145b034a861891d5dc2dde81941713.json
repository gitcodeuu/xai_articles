Shakeel Ahmed Mir officially announced Shahid Khan Afridi as the brand ambassador for Vision Pakistan 2030. Talking on the occasion, Shahid Afridi endorsed the Vision Pakistan 2030 project, calling it a \"ray of hope for the nation. \"Now is the time for unity. In cricket, we win against the biggest rivals when we play like a team. We need to show the same spirit in real life, especially for the families affected by the floods, who are our biggest responsibility right now,\" he said. He added that he fully support this vision, which would provide youth with access to technology, education and entrepreneurial opportunities. These were considered as the foundation for a secure and prosperous future. \"If the government, private sector and public join hands, Pakistan could reach new heights of progress in just a few years,\" he said. Speaking on the occasion, Shakeel Ahmed Mir stated that Pakistan was going through one of the toughest challenges in its history. The recent floods had displaced millions of families, severely damaging agriculture and basic infrastructure and putting the public under extreme duress. \"This is not the time for mere sympathy, but for concrete and practical action.
