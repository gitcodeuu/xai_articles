    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 24 (APP):The Ambassador of Norway to Pakistan, Per Albert Ilsaas has said that sustainable development, rules-based order and economic progression are hallmarks of his country's policy, and hoped that the world will be a better place if the Charter of the United Nations is adhered to in letter and spirit. Speaking at the \"Diplomatic Reflections\" forum organized by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), the envoy said that Oslo has a policy of \"no nukes and no bases\", and believes in deterring aggression, said a press release issued on Wednesday. He remarked that irrespective of a country being an ally or an adversary, Norway believes in upholding International Law and principles of peaceful coexistence, and calls a spade a spade. Dilating upon the International Order in the wake of World War II, Ambassador Albert said that the emergence of United Nations, NATO, Council of Europe and a rules-based order was a blessing, and it is high time deviations are checked for a peaceful and coordinated world order. He underscored the need for more cooperation between Norway and Pakistan, and highlighted the progress attained in the last many decades. He also said that he is pleased to learn about the passion for rule of law, supremacy of constitution, independence of judiciary from Pakistani Op-Eds, and said that both the countries share the denominator in economic progress and democracy. Ambassador Albert talked about the richness of Arctic region and the economic opportunities in trade and navigation. He observed that Russia's aggression over Ukraine and occupation of Crimea have created a security misbalance, and underscored the need for checking this tendency. To a question on President Trump's desire to takeover Greenland as part of 'strategic depth', the ambassador said that it is a point of concern for Norway, and Oslo's positioning will be with the Danish government. Ambassador Albert dispelled the tendency in international relations based on double-standards, and supported the two-state solution on Palestine. He condemned Israel's Gaza massacre and genocide, and called for addressing the issue on an urgent basis. He also stressed the need for proactivity in regional organisations, and for working closely with Pakistan for the collective good of both the countries.",
