    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 24 (APP):The National Disaster Management Authority's (NDMA) National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) issued a precautionary advisory on Wednesday, warning of potential rainfall in the upper catchments of the Indus and Kabul rivers-including Rawalpindi and Islamabad-within the next 24 hours. According to the NDMA, Kotri Barrage is experiencing a medium-level flood with river flows around 400,000 cusecs, expected to persist through the end of September. Meanwhile, water levels at Guddu and Sukkur barrages are gradually receding and remain within the normal range. The Ravi River is showing a declining trend at Ganda Singh Wala, while low-level flooding continues at Sulemanki and Islam barrages. NEOC has cautioned that current river flows may inundate low-lying areas at several points. The NDMA stated it is monitoring the situation around the clock and has issued advisories to all relevant departments. The public is urged to avoid unnecessary travel in vulnerable areas and strictly refrain from crossing floodwaters. Residents in relief camps have been advised to remain in place until official clearance is given to return to their native areas.",
