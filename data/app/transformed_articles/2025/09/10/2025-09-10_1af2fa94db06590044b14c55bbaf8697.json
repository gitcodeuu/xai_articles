Extending heartfelt felicitations to the Muslim Ummah on the auspicious occasion of Eid Milad-un-Nabi, the Chairman Senate said that the birth of the Holy Prophet Muhammad is a divine blessing and a source of mercy, guidance, and salvation for the entire humanity. In his address, Gilani emphasized that the true and lasting solution to the challenges faced by the Muslim world lies only in following the noble teachings of the Holy Prophet. \"The message of Eid Milad-un-Nabi is one of unity, brotherhood, equality, and peace, and by practising these values, we can lay the foundation of a peaceful and prosperous society,\" he stated.
