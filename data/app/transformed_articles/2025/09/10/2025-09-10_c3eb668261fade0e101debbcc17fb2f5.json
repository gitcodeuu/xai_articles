In its capacity as the chair of SCO-RATS, Pakistan will work towards fostering regional cooperation against terrorism, in line with shared priorities, guided by the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust, equality, and shared responsibility. It will also host events and activities across key domains - including cyber counterterrorism, information operations, border security, countering terrorist financing, and capacity-building - to deepen collaboration. \"As a frontline state in combating terrorism, Pakistan continues to make unparalleled sacrifices to ensure safety and security not only of its own people but the region and beyond,\" it was added. The spokesperson further said that as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2025-26 term, Pakistan had also been entrusted with key responsibilities in the counter terrorism domain, among others.
