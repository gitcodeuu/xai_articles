Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas issued a written order of the hearing on the petition of a citizen Muhammad Basharat, in which it was taken the position that under the PERA Act, private schools are obliged to give admission to ten percent of poor children, but Section 10 of the PERA Act is not being implemented. He requested the court to issue orders to PERA to implement the law. The court issued a notice to PERA on the petition and sought a report. The court asked to tell how many deserving children private schools provided free education?",
