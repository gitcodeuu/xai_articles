    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 14 (APP):On the occasion of the International Day of Democracy, National Assembly, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq paid tribute to Pakistan's unwavering democratic resolve, parliamentary continuity, and sustained public participation. He stated that democracy is the embodiment of people's power, collective wisdom, and the key to national development and prosperity. He emphasized that this day serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by political workers, leaders, and journalists who struggled tirelessly for the restoration and preservation of democracy. Speaker remarked that Pakistan was founded as a result of a democratic struggle, and the Constitution of Pakistan ensures every citizen's right to equality, religious freedom, freedom of expression, and participatory politics. He highlighted that Islam also teaches consultation, mutual consensus, and public participation, values upon which democratic governance and public representation are firmly established. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq asserted that Parliament is the supreme forum reflecting the will of the people. Through legislation, public representation, and parliamentary oversight, Parliament transforms public aspirations into reality. He stated that parliamentary supremacy, full adherence to the Constitution, institutional harmony, and public welfare are essential pillars of democratic stability. Referring to Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's historic speech of 11 August, Speaker NA reiterated that every citizen has the right to religious freedom and that the state has no concern with a citizen's religion, caste, or creed. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq paid heartfelt tribute to political leaders including former Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, former First Lady Begum Kulsoom Nawaz, and former Prime Ministers Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, among others, for their sacrifices and struggles for the restoration and strengthening of democracy in Pakistan. Speaker further said that the democratic system empowers citizens, ensures accountability of institutions, and offers collective insight for national progress. He called on all political parties to set aside their differences and adopt a unified national strategy in the interest of the country. Stressing the importance of youth engagement in the democratic process, Speaker highlighted several initiatives of the National Assembly including the Parliamentary Studies Program, National Assembly Youth Internship Programs, and the Young Parliamentarians Forum. These initiatives aim to integrate the youth into the democratic process and ensure their active role in national development. He said that youth participation is fundamental in making democracy effective and sustainable. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also noted that Pakistan's Parliament has enacted significant legislation on critical issues such as women's rights, financial transparency, and environmental protection. Through platforms such as the Women's Parliamentary Caucus, Parliamentary Task Force on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Parliamentary Caucus on Child Rights, and the Young Parliamentarians Forum, inter-party collaboration has been significantly enhanced. He stressed that these platforms enable cross-party cooperation and embody the true spirit of participatory democracy and good governance. Deputy Speaker National Assembly, Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, also shared his views on the occasion of International Day of Democracy. He said that the unmatched sacrifices of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto for democracy serve as guiding lights for the nation. He underscored that democracy is not just a system of governance but a belief in sovereignty, civil liberties, and constitutional supremacy. Deputy Speaker further stated that Parliament is the platform where representatives with diverse political ideologies come together to make laws. He appreciated the role of all parliamentary caucuses and emphasized that inter-party dialogue and consultation are the true essence of democracy, and that this path leads to a brighter and sustainable future for Pakistan.",
