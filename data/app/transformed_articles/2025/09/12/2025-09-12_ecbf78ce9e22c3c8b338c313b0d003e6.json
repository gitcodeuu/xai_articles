    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 12 (APP):In a significant move to strengthen Pakistan's engineering workforce, the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Thar Coal Block-1 Power Generation Company, Sino Sindh Resources, and Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company. The agreement, part of the Thar Block-1 project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), outlines a five-year programme for training, capacity building, engineer exchange, and Chinese language learning. Under the initiative, 20 fresh engineering graduates will undergo a six-week training programme at Thar each year, combining classroom learning with practical exposure in power plant and mining operations. Over the course of five years, 100 engineers will receive hands-on training at the Thar project. Additionally, five to ten engineers will be sent annually to China for advanced short-term training, enabling knowledge exchange in modern energy technologies. The collaboration also establishes an annual scholarship fund of Rs3.5 million to support 35 deserving students, particularly in energy and mining disciplines. A total of 175 students will benefit over five years, with opportunities to pursue higher education in China. Another key component of the programme is Chinese language training for up to 50 participants, aimed at improving communication between Pakistani and Chinese engineers and strengthening cooperation in joint projects. Special emphasis has been placed on encouraging participation from women and students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The MoU was signed on behalf of PEC by Dr. Ashfaq A. Sheikh, Technical Advisor Regulations. Chairman PEC, Engr. Waseem Nazir said the initiative reflects PEC's commitment to equipping young engineers with practical skills, international exposure, and language training. He added that the programme will create new career pathways for Pakistani engineers while enhancing local capacity to meet the country's energy and industrial needs.",
