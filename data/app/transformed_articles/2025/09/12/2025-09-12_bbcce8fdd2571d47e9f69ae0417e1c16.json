    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 12 (APP):The Advisor of the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Bangladesh, Dr A F M Khalid Hossain, during his official visit to the COMSTECH Secretariat, underscored the need for unity and collaboration among Muslim countries to address contemporary challenges through science, technology, and education. In his remarks, Dr Hossain lauded the COMSTECH Ministerial Standing Committee of the OIC for its pivotal role in advancing research and capacity building in areas such as artificial intelligence, climate change, environment, and poverty alleviation across the Muslim world. He particularly expressed gratitude for COMSTECH's initiative of allocating 100 scholarships for Bangladeshi students at the University of Lahore, terming it a valuable contribution toward empowering the country's youth. He urged that such opportunities should also be extended to students from Madrassa backgrounds, especially those with strong foundations in Quran and Hadith studies, so that they may diversify into fields like medicine, engineering, and technology. Stressing the importance of solidarity, Dr Hossain remarked: \"We must unite under the banner of Islam, under the guidance of the Quran and Hadith, for the greater interest of the Muslim Ummah. Without unity in diversity, we cannot progress.\" The Advisor also expressed keen interest in COMSTECH's support for the establishment of a Halal Institute in Uganda and highlighted ongoing efforts by Bangladesh's Islamic Foundation on Halal certification. He proposed collaboration with Pakistan's Halal Authority and sought COMSTECH's technical expertise for capacity building in this area. The Ambassador of Bangladesh to Pakistan, Md Iqbal Hussain Khan, extended appreciation to the Coordinator General and COMSTECH officials for their warm hospitality and reaffirmed Bangladesh's commitment to working closely with COMSTECH for achieving mutual benefits and strengthening cooperation among OIC member states.",
