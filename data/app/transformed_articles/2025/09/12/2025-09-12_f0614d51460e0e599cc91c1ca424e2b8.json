His unwavering resolve and exemplary leadership inspired his men. The steadfast defense against superior enemy forces was pivotal in halting their advance, rendering his sacrifice a defining moment of the war and an ultimate symbol of courage and patriotism, said an ISPR news release. His selfless leadership and devotion to duty serve as a beacon of inspiration for our future generations. As the nation commemorates his sacrifice, we honour the legacy of all martyrs who have laid down their lives for the nation's sovereignty and security.
