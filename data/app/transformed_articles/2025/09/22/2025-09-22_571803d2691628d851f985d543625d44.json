    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 22 (APP):As part of its progressive ESG vision, Jazz has launched the Sustainable Supply Chain Program, a new initiative aimed at strengthening collaboration with its supplier base on sustainability and responsible business practices. Through this initiative, Jazz will engage with suppliers to enhance transparency, build capacity for reducing environmental impacts, including Scope 3 emissions, and identify opportunities for innovation and joint action on sustainability - marking an important milestone in the company's broader ESG agenda. Drawing on insights from the GSMA Climate Action Task Force, Jazz developed the Sustainable Supply Chain Program to further strengthen its ESG activities and play a meaningful role in tackling global climate challenges. This program is part of our IFC & PBC Climate2Equal Pledge, reinforcing the company's commitment to advancing climate action and equity across its operations and supply chain. Commenting on the development, Fatima Akhtar, Head of Corporate Communications & ESG at Jazz, said: \"At Jazz, sustainability is not just about how we operate, but how we extend responsibility across our entire value chain. Our Sustainable Supply Chain Program is enabling suppliers to adopt responsible practices that protect both communities and the environment. Beyond reducing Scope 3 emissions, it is setting a higher bar for collaboration and climate action, demonstrating what it means to be a responsible, future-ready business.\" Since initiating its ESG journey, Jazz has consistently followed climate and sustainability goals in alignment with global best practices. The Sustainable Supply Chain Program builds on these efforts and underscores Jazz's commitment to driving sustainability throughout its operations and supplier network, setting a new benchmark in its ESG journey.",
