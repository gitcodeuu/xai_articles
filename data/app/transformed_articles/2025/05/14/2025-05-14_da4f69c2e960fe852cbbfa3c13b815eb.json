    "article_body": "PASRUR, SIALKOT, May 14 (APP):Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday hailed the country's recent military triumph against India as a \"historic victory\" that would be \"remembered in golden words forever.\" Flanked by top military leadership, including Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, alongwith the Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Defence Minister, Minister for Planning and Development, and Information Minister, the prime minister visited Pasrur Cantonment, Sialkot to commend the exceptional bravery and professionalism of the troops during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, part of The Marka-e-Haq (The Battle of Truth). The prime minister paid rich tribute to the valour, professionalism, and unshakable resolve of the armed forces. Referring to Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, Prime Minister Sharif called it a tale of \"courage and valour\" that he pledged to document in his autobiography. \"Our soldiers gave the enemy a befitting response,\" he said, highlighting that not a single inch of territory was ceded despite difficult conditions. \"The Corps Commander told me how our brave men held their ground and repelled the enemy in an unfavourable situation.\" He applauded the Pakistan Air Force's \"extraordinary effort\" in neutralizing enemy aircraft, saying it was a practical demonstration of Pakistan's advanced military capabilities. \"The world now acknowledges Pakistan's supremacy not only in conventional but also in technical warfare,\" he added. PM Sharif warned that Pakistan's red lines-especially concerning the Indus Waters Treaty-must not be crossed. \"If you dare stop our water, remember this: water and blood will not flow together,\" he declared. He accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of sponsoring acts of terrorism in Pakistan, including alleged involvement in the Samjhauta Express attack and unrest in Balochistan. \"Mr. Modi, who trained the Mukti Bahini and lit the spark of division in East Pakistan, should not lecture us on terrorism,\" the prime minister said. \"We have suffered over 90,000 civilian casualties and $150 billion in economic losses due to terrorism.\" He reiterated that peace and development are Pakistan's primary objectives. \"We seek peace, but this must never be misunderstood as weakness,\" he said. \"We are ready for peace-and we are ready for war. The choice is yours.\" The prime minister thanked the top military leadership for their meticulous planning and coordination during the conflict. \"I personally witnessed the efforts of General Asim Munir, whose aggressive and tactical leadership turned the tide. Air Chief Zaheer Babar regularly briefed me on the technological edge our Air Force holds, which was evident on May 9 and 10.\" He said the recent military performance had become a source of pride for friendly countries and would be studied by military experts for years. \"The leadership of our armed forces has become revered. I am proud of them, and the nation stands behind them like a rock.\" While opening the door to future talks with India, PM Sharif emphasized that no dialogue could be one-sided. \"There will be no trade with India unless it is part of a comprehensive dialogue. Kashmir remains unresolved as per UN Security Council resolutions, and this must be addressed.\" He recalled his earlier address at Pakistan Military Academy Kakul, where he invited India to allow a transparent international commission to investigate alleged terrorist incident in Pahalgam, only to receive what he called a \"dastardly night attack\" in response. \"We are eliminating terrorism on our western borders too,\" he added. \"If you attack us again, what you are left with will be destroyed.\" Concluding his address, the prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to peace and development but warned that any further aggression would meet an overwhelming response. \"The lesson for the Modi regime is this: our armed forces exercised restraint not out of fear, but discipline. We are ready for whatever may come. Pakistan will remain thriving until the Day of Judgment.\" He ended with a call to the Indian leadership to act sincerely for the sake of regional peace. \"Stop misleading your people. Come to the table with honesty-or face the consequences of your arrogance.\"",
