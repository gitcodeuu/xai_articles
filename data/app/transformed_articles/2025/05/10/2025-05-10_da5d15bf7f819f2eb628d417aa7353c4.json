The nation stands united,\" he said in a tweet. Bilawal Bhutto said that today from Karachi to Khyber, from Gwadar to Gilgit, every Pakistani stands with Pakistan armed forces. \"We salute the professionalism of our defenders including our valiant Air Force and the unity of our people. No force can break a nation whose spirit is forged in sacrifice and solidarity,\" he added.",
