During the conference, IGP Rizvi instructed officers to upgrade all check posts and deploy young police officers at these points, ensuring polite interactions with citizens while maintaining robust security. He emphasized the importance of coordination and teamwork, stressing that no negligence in duty would be tolerated. He further directed all officers to uphold the high values and principles of Islamabad Police.

A security and safety committee will be established within Islamabad Police. Security must be increased at important installations and high-security zones in the federal capital. Comprehensive search operations will be conducted against criminal and disruptive elements. The IGP also directed a strong crackdown on beggars and legal action against those forcing others to beg.
