    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 16 (APP):The Organization of Islamic Cooperation's science body, COMSTECH and the Federal Republic of Somalia have agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in key sectors including healthcare, higher education, and innovation. This was the outcome of a significant meeting held in Islamabad between Somali Ambassador Sheikh Noor Muhammad Hassan and COMSTECH Coordinator General, Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary, accompanied by senior officials. Responding to a formal request from the Embassy of Somalia, COMSTECH agreed to provide travel support for Somali students enrolled in undergraduate and postgraduate programs at member institutions of the COMSTECH Consortium of Excellence (CCOE). The move aims to enhance educational opportunities for Somali youth and foster long-term scientific collaboration. During the meeting, both sides identified priority areas for joint initiatives that can address Somalia's pressing development needs. These include capacity building in healthcare, support for higher education institutions, and strengthening research and innovation ecosystems in Somalia. Ambassador Hassan expressed his deep appreciation for COMSTECH's efforts to uplift scientific and technological capacities across OIC member states, especially African nations. He praised the organization's role in promoting knowledge exchange, facilitating technical assistance, and building research networks across the Muslim world. Prof. Dr. Choudhary reaffirmed COMSTECH's commitment to supporting Somalia in establishing a sustainable science and technology infrastructure. He assured the Ambassador of COMSTECH's readiness to provide expert training, facilitate academic exchanges, and undertake collaborative research aligned with Somalia's national priorities. The two sides discussed the appointment of a focal person by the Somali government to coordinate bilateral efforts, as well as the organization of specialized medical camps in Somalia, led by experienced surgeons and ENT specialists. They also explored the inclusion of Somalia's top five universities in the CCOE network, along with opportunities for scholarships and fellowships for Somali students. Additionally, training programs for government officials, support in policy formulation, and internship opportunities for Somali youth were proposed as part of the evolving collaboration. Both parties agreed to maintain regular engagement and to work toward formalizing their partnership through concrete projects and strategic frameworks that promote sustainable development and mutual benefit.",
