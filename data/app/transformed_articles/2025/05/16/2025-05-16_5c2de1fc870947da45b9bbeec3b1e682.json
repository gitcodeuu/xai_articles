    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 16 (APP): Senators on Friday lauded Pakistan's armed forces for giving a befitting response to enemy's illegal aggression and said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pursuing a fascist and expansionist agenda. Participating in a debate on Indian aggression in the Senate on Friday, Senator Ali Zafar said that the recent Indian aggression has once again proven that Pakistan remains resilient, united and fully capable of defending its sovereignty against any form of aggression. He said, \"The entire nation, including our armed forces, scientists, engineers, media, and youth on social media, stood together to defend Pakistan's honor and expose India's false propaganda.\" The lawmaker said Pakistan's retaliatory action was measured, precise, and within the bounds of international law, demonstrating Pakistan's status as a responsible nuclear power. Senator Zafar said India failed to secure international support while Pakistan's principled stance was appreciated globally. \"China stood by us, and even neutral states began to question India's narrative and acknowledge Pakistan's responsible behavior,\" he added. He paid tribute to martyrs, including the security personnel and innocent civilians. Senator Ali Zafar proposed establishing a joint parliamentary committee to monitor water issues and ensure national preparedness in future conflicts. Senator Nasir Abbas said that Narendra Modi is a fascist leader and the butcher of Gujarat, whose politics were rooted in hatred and bigotry. \"His failed attempts to crush the Kashmiri people and provoke regional conflict have backfired. We must remain vigilant and united to protect Pakistan's sovereignty,\" he added. Nasir Abbas said Modi had adopted a dangerous unilateral approach where he \"plays judge, jury, and executioner,\" posing a serious threat to regional stability and trying to destabilize the peace of the region in collaboration with Israel. \"Modi is a terrorist who has repeatedly tried to impose war on our peace-loving nation. He wants to establish Indian supremacy in the region through cowardly tactics,\" Senator Nasir said, adding that the Pakistani nation stands united with its valiant armed forces. \"Every individual in this nation has the courage to take up arms in the defence of the motherland.\" Senator Abdul Qadir hailed the armed forces' response as a \"historic moment of pride,\" congratulating the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Pakistan Air Force (PAF) for their coordinated and forceful retaliation. He said nation is observing Youm-e-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day) today to mark the historic victory of Marka-e-Haq and to pay tribute to the armed forces. \"India is not interested in resolving the Kashmir dispute peacefully. It has weaponized water by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty - water is Pakistan's lifeline,\" he warned. Senator Jam Saifullah Khan expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of civilians and condemned the targeting of mosques and innocent lives, and called it an international crime. He extended gratitude to friendly nations, especially China, for their unwavering support in this critical time. Senator Khalil Tahir Sandu paid glowing tributes to Squadron Leader Usman Yousaf, Mubashir Hussain, and other martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the nation. He commended Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, and Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir for their decisive leadership. \"India's illegal aggression was responded to with strength and strategy. The nation stood shoulder-to-shoulder with its forces and proved its unity to the world,\" he said. Senator Aon Abbas said the celebration of Youm-e-Tashakur was a testament to Pakistan's resolve and national unity. \"Whenever the enemy tries aggression, Pakistan responds as one. We are thankful to friendly nations including China, Turkiye, and Azerbaijan, who openly backed our stance.\" Senator Haji Hidayatullah Khan reminded the House of the sacrifices of leaders like Bacha Khan and Wali Khan for parliamentary supremacy, calling for continued unity in the face of external threats. Senator Bilal Ahmed Khan paid tribute to the people and armed forces of Pakistan for giving \"befitting reply\" to India's cowardice. He also appreciated PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's firm stance on international forums and commended national leadership for lifting Pakistan's stature globally. \"Thanks to our leadership, Pakistan's pride has been restored.
