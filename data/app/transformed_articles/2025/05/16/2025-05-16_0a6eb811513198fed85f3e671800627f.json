The nation is passionately observing this historic victory with national zeal, and paying homage to the Almighty, besides prayers for our martyrs. The day dawned with special prayers in Mosques and recitation of Holy Quran. Thirty-one-gun salute after Fajr Prayar in the Federal Capital and a twenty-one-gun salute at provincial capitals was boomed to mark the Day. Corps Commander Lahore (IV Corps), Lieutenant General Syed Fayyaz Hussain Shah, visited the mausoleum of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, the Poet of the East and Thinker of Pakistan, as part of the Youm-e-Tashakur (Day of Thanksgiving) celebrations.
