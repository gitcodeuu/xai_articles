David Lammy MP at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest. DPM/FM Dar extended a warm welcome to Foreign Secretary Lammy on his first official visit to Pakistan. The two leaders held detailed discussions on recent developments in South Asia, particularly the situation following the ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India.

He underlined that Pakistan exercised its right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and that Pakistan's response remained limited, precise, and proportionate with utmost care taken to avoid civilian casualties. DPM/FM Dar appreciated the UK's constructive and productive engagement in helping de-escalate the situation. Both sides emphasized the importance of restraint and sustained dialogue to prevent further escalation and to maintain regional peace and stability.
