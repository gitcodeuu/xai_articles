    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 22 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that the government was taking practical steps to achieve maximum benefits from the World Bank's development investment. The prime minister, in a meeting with a World Bank delegation led by Managing Director of Operations Anna Bjerde here, lauded the Bank's key role as an important development partner in Pakistan's progress. He expressed the hope that the World Bank's Country Partnership Framework would bring more than $20 billion in development investment to Pakistan. The prime minister also appreciated the World Bank's assistance to the victims of 2022 floods in Pakistan that had impacted millions of people, destroying livelihoods and properties. In her remarks, World Bank Managing Director Anna Bjerde said that the World Bank valued its historic partnership with the Government of Pakistan for the development and prosperity of its people. She also expressed special gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz for his effective role in strengthening the partnership and implementing the Country Partnership Program. Also appreciating Pakistan's recent exemplary economic performance and stability, she said that through its positive actions for macroeconomic stability, Pakistan had achieved the impossible. She said that the World Bank looked forward to continued cooperation to achieve the positive outcomes of the Country Partnership Framework. The managing director viewed that the prime minister's leadership, his commitment to the uplift of the Pakistani people, policy continuity for sustainable and inclusive growth, and efforts to engage all stakeholders at the political level, made Pakistan a model for the World Bank's partnership framework in other countries. She said that due to the prime minister's excellent and effective leadership, the Country Partnership Framework was being referred to globally as the \"Pakistan Model\".
