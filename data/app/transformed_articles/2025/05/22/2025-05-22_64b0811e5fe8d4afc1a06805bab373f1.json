    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 22 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar hailed Africa as the \"continent of the future\" and emphasized the need to scale up investment through public-private partnerships, highlighting agriculture, infrastructure, mining, fintech, and healthcare as priority sectors for deeper collaboration and economic engagement. Speaking in the Senate the other day, Dar highlighted Africa as the world's youngest region, home to over 1.6 billion people and a rapidly growing economy. He noted that the continent's collective GDP stands at approximately $2.8 trillion and is expected to surpass $3 trillion in the near future. Despite of its vast potential, Pakistan's annual trade with African nations remains below $5 billion. Dar stressed the need to expand this figure by increasing exports of Pakistani products such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, surgical instruments, and sports goods, while also encouraging greater imports of African commodities including cotton, minerals, oil, pulses, and coffee. Deputy Prime Minister extended warm greetings to the people and governments of Africa, emphasizing a shared history and a promising future rooted in cooperation and mutual respect. \"Under the leadership of Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gillani, we celebrate not only our deep historical ties with Africa but also a future built on strategic partnership,\" Dar stated. He recalled Pakistan's steadfast support for African independence movements in the 20th century, emphasizing that this backing was driven not by political interests, but by shared values such as justice, dignity, and the right to self-determination. He noted that many African freedom fighters even traveled on Pakistani documents to garner international support for their cause. Dar further highlighted that Pakistan has consistently championed Africa's voice on the global stage, including at the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the African Union. Highlighting Pakistan's long-standing contributions to global peace efforts, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar stated that Pakistan has been one of the leading contributors to UN peacekeeping missions in Africa since the 1960s. \"Many of our peacekeepers have laid down their lives to ensure the safety and security of our African brothers and sisters,\" he said. Dar also underscored the significance of Pakistan's \"Engage Africa Policy,\" aimed at strengthening diplomatic, economic, security, educational, and cultural ties with African nations. As part of this initiative, Pakistan has established new diplomatic missions in Rwanda, Ghana, Uganda, and Ivory Coast. He announced that the Senate is adopting a landmark resolution to designate May 25 as \"Pakistan-Africa Friendship Day,\" reaffirming the country's commitment to strengthening ties with the African continent. The Deputy Prime Minister also praised parliamentary friendship groups for their vital role in advancing Pakistan-Africa relations, describing them as an important instrument of diplomacy.",
