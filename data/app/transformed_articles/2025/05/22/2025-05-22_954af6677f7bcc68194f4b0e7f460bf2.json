    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 22 (APP):The Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources, Chaired by Senator Shahadat Awan, convened on Thursday for an in-depth discussion on Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in the light of the recent hostilities committed by the India. Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters, Syed Muhammad Mehar Ali Shah, briefed that Indus Waters Treaty is a bilateral treaty between Pakistan and India that cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally. He apprised that ,as of now,Treaty is fully enforced and is legally binding on both the countries. He added that the recent attempt of Indian Government to stop the water of western rivers is a sheer violation of Indus Waters Treaty, said a press release. Later, the Chairman Committee deliberated the stance of the Committee regarding the subject issue, to which all the members of Committee and representatives of ministry of water resources endorsed. The Committee condemns India's unlawful and unilateral declaration of holding the Indus Waters Treaty 1960, in abeyance following the false flag operation in Pahalgam. This provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity, and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan. We would like to add here that the Indus Waters Treaty remains in force and legally binding on both parties under Clause 4 of the Article XII of the Treaty and the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, as none of the aforesaid provisions allow unilateral suspension or termination of the Treaty under any circumstances. The President of World Bank has also recently endorsed that this international agreement cannot be held in abeyance by one party and continues to obligate both nations to uphold its provisions. The Committee is of considerate view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit. We will continue to vigorously defend our rights under this Treaty at all international forums. This treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian State whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters,especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles. The Committee further Condemns the attack of India on the Neelum Jehlum Project and views this action as nothing less than \"water warfare and aggression\" a coward and illegal move that threatens the regional stability. India's weaponization of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan. Moreover, the continued interference with Pakistan's rightful water access under the Treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries. We hereby call upon the international community to take immediate notice of India's aggression. We urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations. We maintain that every drop of water allocated to Pakistan under the Treaty is ours by right, and we will defend this right with full force, legally and politically at global level. The Committee reaffirms that Pakistan remains committed to peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the fundamental dispute over Jammu and Kashmir. However, we will not compromise on our existential water rights. We demand that India ought to refrain from the water aggression against Pakistan and ensure full compliance with all provisions of this landmark Treaty. The Committee reiterates that Water is our red line. Any threat to Water security is a threat to our existence and we are confident that our armed forces are alert and capable to defend the motherland and protect the rights of Pakistan. In attendance were Senators Faisal Saleem Rahman, Saadia Abbasi, Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, Poonjo Bheel, Federal Minister for Water Resources Muhammad Mueen Watto, Secretary for Water Resources Syed Ali Murtaza, Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhamamd Mehar Ali Shah and other concerned.",
