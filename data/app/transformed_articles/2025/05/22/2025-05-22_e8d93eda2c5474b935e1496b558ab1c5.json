    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 22 (APP):A high-level delegation from the World Bank, headed by Managing Director of Operations Ms. Anna Bjerde, visited the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) One Window Facilitation Center in Islamabad, to assess the integrated services being provided to BISP beneficiaries. The delegation was warmly welcomed by Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Syed Imran Ahmad Shah, BISP Chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid, and BISP Secretary Amer Ali Ahmed. Among the visiting officials were World Bank Country Director Mr. Najy Benhassine; Operations Manager Mr. Gailius J. Draugelis; Program Lead (Human Development) Ms. Hnin Hnin Pyne; Senior Operations Officer Ms. Eva Liselotte Lescrauwaet; Senior Social Protection Specialist Mr. Amjad Zafar Khan; Special Assistant to the MD Operations Ms. Anne Senges; and Senior Program Assistant Mr. Waleed Anwar. In her welcome remarks, Senator Rubina Khalid expressed deep appreciation for the World Bank's longstanding and transformative partnership with BISP. She underscored the program's legacy, rooted in the vision of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, and its role in empowering women through CNIC-based eligibility and access to social safety nets. She highlighted BISP's contributions to increasing child registration with NADRA and its position as the second-largest data repository in the country. \"BISP is not only a social safety program-it is a movement for women's recognition and empowerment,\" she added. Secretary Amer Ali Ahmed briefed the delegation on BISP's core initiatives, including the new programs under the World Bank-supported Crisis Resilient Social Protection (CRISP) framework. He emphasized the organization's drive towards financial inclusion through digital banking and mobile payment solutions. The delegation toured the facilitation center, interacting with beneficiaries and observing the delivery of efficient, inclusive services. Impressed by the operations, Ms. Anna Bjerde praised BISP's role in delivering both conditional and unconditional cash transfers to vulnerable populations. She particularly lauded the focus on digital payment systems, nutrition, and female education. \"I am truly impressed to see that we have forged a partnership that supports communities not only during times of stability but also in the face of adversity,\" Ms. Bjerde remarked. \"BISP's effective response during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 floods demonstrates its resilience. Experience shows that investing in women, especially female-headed households, leads to better outcomes for entire communities.\"",
