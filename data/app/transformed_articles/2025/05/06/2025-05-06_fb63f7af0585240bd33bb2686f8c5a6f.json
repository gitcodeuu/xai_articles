    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 6 (APP):Minister of State for Religious Affairs Khel Das Kohistani on Tuesday said that India staged the Pahalgam episode as a political drama, but Pakistan has exposed the facts to the world with clarity and evidence. Talking to a private news channel, he said that Pakistan has strongly condemned the loss of precious lives in the incident and expressed deep sorrow. However, this false flag operation was politically motivated, and India will not succeed in its objectives, he stated. Kohistani said that both houses of Parliament have unanimously passed resolutions, with all political parties united in the view that the nation stands together in the face of external threats. \"A clear and collective message has gone out from Pakistan - the entire nation is united, and if any misadventure is attempted, it will receive a crushing response,\" he warned.",
