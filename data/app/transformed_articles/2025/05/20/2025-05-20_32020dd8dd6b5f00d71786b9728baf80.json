Together, we can turn contention into consensus and scarcity into shared prosperity.\" Speaking on national unity, he emphasized that Balochistan is an integral part of the country. He noted that while there may be differences in language, people across provinces share a common identity. \"Our nation's strength lies in its people-from the farmer in Sindh to the student in Balochistan and the mother in Punjab-facing daily hardships where resource disputes mean a fight for dignity, equity, and hope.\" The Parliamentary Secretary said whenever the PML-N government comes to power, it select local leaders who represent the Balochistan community and promote collective progress. He said there are several development projects underway in Balochistan and more details will be shared soon. Young members of parliament from Balochistan are actively raising their issues, and the government is aware of its and working towards long-term solutions. On energy and governance, Chaudhary spoke in support of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and its role in promoting coordination.
