According an ISPR news release, an intelligence based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in general area Gishkur, Awaran District, on reported presence of Indian-sponsored terrorists. During the conduct of operation, the troops effectively engaged the terrorists' location and after an intense fire exchange, Indian-sponsored terrorist Younas was killed, while two Indian sponsored terrorists got injured. In another engagement in Turbat City, Kech District, security forces successfully neutralized two Indian-sponsored terrorists; terrorist ring leader Sabr Ullah and terrorist Amjad @ Bichoo. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed Indian-sponsored terrorists, who remained actively involved in multiple terrorists activities against the Law Enforcement Agencies as well as target killing of innocent civilians. Sanitization operations are being conducted to eliminate any terrorist present in the area, as security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts by Indian proxies at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan.",
