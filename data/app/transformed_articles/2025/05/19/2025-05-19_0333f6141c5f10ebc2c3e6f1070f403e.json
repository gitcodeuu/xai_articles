    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 19 (APP):The Senate of Pakistan passed nine significant bills on Monday, following extensive debates and discussions. These bills, which had already been approved in the lower house of Parliament, cover a broad range of issues, from child marriage prevention to amendments in national laws concerning trade organizations and motor vehicle safety. One of the most contentious pieces of legislation, The Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025, was presented by Senator Sherry Rehman. While the bill garnered significant support, it also faced strong objections from some members of the Senate. Senators Kamran Murtaza and Attaur Rehman raised concerns over the bill and suggested referring it to the Council of Islamic Ideology for further review. Despite these objections, the bill was passed after a heated debate. In addition to the child marriage bill, several other key legislative changes were approved, including: The Trade Organizations (Second Amendment) Bill, 2025, presented by Shahadat Awan.
