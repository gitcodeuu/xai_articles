    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 12 (APP): A powerful call for decentralization and grassroots empowerment echoed at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) as it launched \"Local Government: Foundation of Democratic System\", a compelling book authored by Barrister Naseem Ahmed Bajwa. The event brought together policymakers, academics, civil society leaders, and legal experts who unanimously emphasized that without functional and empowered local governments, Pakistan's democratic dream remains incomplete, said a press release. Dr. Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director of SDPI, opened the discussion by stressing that sustainable development and economic resilience are only achievable through a robust local government system. \"In the ongoing budget season, the absence of a Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) is a glaring issue. Without it, equitable distribution of resources remains a fantasy,\" he said, underscoring that centralized control is a threat to inclusive progress. Barrister Naseem Ahmed Bajwa, the author and guest of honour, described the book as a tribute to the silenced voices of 250 million citizens lacking representation at the grassroots level. \"Europe's development isn't a miracle-it's the power of strong local governance,\" he declared. Citing Article 140-A and 32 of the Constitution, Bajwa labeled the current governance structure \"unconstitutional\" for failing to operationalize local government systems. Prof. Dr. Humera Ashfaq, progressive poet and highlighted the historical instability of local governments in Pakistan but stressed their role in enabling development, inclusion, and conflict resolution. \"Engaging local leadership is vital to reducing insurgency and alienation,\" she said. Syed Kaleem Imam, former Inspector General of Police and National Coordinator of UNAIDS, drew global comparisons. \"Germany and Japan thrived in crisis response due to active local governance. Haiti and Iraq, with centralized systems, did not.\" He also pointed out that Islamabad, the federal capital, ironically lacks a local government structure, calling for immediate corrective measures. Muzzafar Mahmood Qureshi, a former civil servant, praised the book's accessible style and comprehensive scope. He lamented the erosion of civic structures like mohalla committees and urged for a revival of civil society and meaningful women's participation, recalling the now-defunct 33% representation benchmark. Former Election Commission Secretary Kunwar Dilshad said, \"The most effective local governance model is in Indonesia, inspired by Pakistan's own 1959 basic democracy system\". He urged the Election Commission to issue a fresh schedule for local body elections. In a Q&A session, Bajwa revealed that despite contacting 1,000 former local government representatives, only three responded to his call for reform in negative. \"Political elites resist change for fear of losing control over the spoils of power,\" he asserted. Dr. Suleri concluded with a forward-looking note: \"This is the spirit of democracy-to engage in debate, refine ideas, and present actionable solutions.\" SDPI will forward recommendations from the event to the Election Commission of Pakistan.",
