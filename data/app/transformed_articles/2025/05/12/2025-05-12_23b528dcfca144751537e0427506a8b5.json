The Federal Minister said that Allah Almighty has blessed Pakistan with a clear victory. Our falcons have humbled India's arrogance, and the enemy is regretting its mistake. He further stated that Pakistan has set a remarkable example of humanity by targeting only Indian military installations, while India has proven its aggression by attacking our mosques and civilian population. Referring to the global stance, Rana Tanveer Hussain said that except Israel, the entire world supports Pakistan's position. He added that under Mian Nawaz Sharif's vision, Pakistan's defense system has strengthened significantly, and now the world will deal with Pakistan on equal terms.
