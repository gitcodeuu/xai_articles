    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 7 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday accused India of escalating tensions through a \"choreographed exercise\" following the Pahalgam attack, warning that any future aggression would be met with a forceful response. Speaking at the National Assembly, Dar stated that Pakistan had demonstrated restraint despite India's airstrikes and hostile actions. He revealed that Pakistan had received intelligence of a possible Indian attack at 10 p.m. on Tuesday, prompting defensive measures. \"There were instructions to only target Indian jets that released payloads,\" Dar said. \"This is why only five jets were taken down. Had the directive been different, nearly 10-12 jets would have been struck.\" He said Pakistan has briefed over 40 countries on its stance and offered an impartial investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India has blamed on Pakistan. Dar emphasized that the international community had appreciated Islamabad's transparency, while India's narrative had failed to gain traction, similar to the aftermath of the Pulwama incident. \"We strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack, even though Pakistan was not directly named in India's accusations,\" he said. Dar detailed India's recent actions, including closing the Attari border, reducing diplomatic staff, expelling defense attaches, and announcing the termination of the Indus Waters Treaty-a move he called \"unilateral and legally untenable.\" Following an Indian airstrike, Pakistan's Air Force shot down five Indian fighter jets. Dar stated that while four Indian jets initially attempted to breach Pakistani airspace, they were intercepted. Later, aircraft striking from within Indian territory were targeted in retaliation. \"Any aircraft crossing into our airspace would be engaged,\" he asserted. He said Pakistan formally notified the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) of India's violations, including 24 attacks on six locations, such as the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project. A closed-door UNSC meeting was held, where Pakistan presented its case. Dar confirmed that China, a key ally, was promptly updated, with a delegation visiting Pakistan's Foreign Office at 4 a.m. after the incident. He noted that Chinese J-10C jets participated in Pakistan's response, while Indian Rafale jets involved in the initial strike-were downed, possibly due to pilot error. The foreign minister reiterated that the Indus Waters Treaty cannot be revoked unilaterally, warning that any such attempt would be considered an act of war. Pakistan's National Security Committee had reinforced this stance in an April 24 meeting. Dar praised the Senate for its unanimous resolution on national security and urged the National Assembly to show similar solidarity. He emphasized that Pakistan's armed forces were authorized to respond decisively to any further aggression. \"The world is not buying India's narrative this time,\" Dar said, condemning New Delhi's actions in Kashmir and vowing to counter its \"failed diplomacy\" through international forums like the OIC.",
