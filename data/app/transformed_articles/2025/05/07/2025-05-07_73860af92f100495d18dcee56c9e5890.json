    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 07 (APP):The Faculty of Engineering and Technology (FET) at the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) hosted its 14th annual open house on Wednesday at the University's new campus. The event featured nearly 100 innovative projects presented by students from the Departments of Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. A key highlight of the event was the active participation of industry representatives, who not only evaluated the students' work but also selected several participants for job placements and paid internships. Students showcased a diverse range of projects addressing real-world problems through creative engineering solutions. Among the standout innovations were solar-powered systems designed for use in agriculture, automobiles, and healthcare; artificial intelligence-based kits; health monitoring devices; smart energy meters; water distribution systems; grid-tie inverters; and other power generation technologies. To recognize outstanding efforts, students were awarded shields and cash prizes. The awards were distributed by President IIUI, Prof. Dr. Ahmed Shuja Syed, who commended the faculty for maintaining the tradition of organizing the open house. Addressing the closing ceremony, he described the event as a symbol of a promising future and a source of optimism for overcoming contemporary challenges. He noted that many of the showcased projects have the potential to serve society meaningfully. He also emphasized the importance of addressing social apathy alongside academic excellence.
