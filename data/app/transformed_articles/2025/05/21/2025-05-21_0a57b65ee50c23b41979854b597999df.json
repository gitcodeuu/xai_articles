    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 21 (APP):Minister of State for Federal Education and Professional Training Ms. Wajiha Qamar, led a high-profile delegation of Pakistani officials and educationists at a prestigious reception hosted by GEMS Education UAE at the British Academy in London. The event aimed to strengthen international collaboration in advancing technical and vocational education and promoting innovation in Pakistan's education system. The reception brought together prominent figures from the United Kingdom, the Middle East, and Pakistan, including education policymakers, institutional leaders, and diplomatic representatives. The occasion served as a powerful platform to explore long-term partnerships focused on skills development and globally relevant learning. In her keynote address, Ms. Wajiha Qamar emphasized the urgency of transforming Pakistan's education sector through inclusive, future-ready, and skill-based learning frameworks. She highlighted that with over 240 million people-64 percent under the age of 30-Pakistan is among the youngest countries in the world. Of the more than 63 million children aged 5 to 16, only 42 percent are enrolled in public schools, while 32 percent remain out of school, and 26 percent are in private or informal institutions. Ms. Qamar called for urgent investment, innovative reforms, and equitable access to quality education, particularly in underserved communities. \"We must move beyond short-term solutions,\" she said. \"Pakistan needs enduring partnerships to create an education system that meets the challenges of today and the opportunities of tomorrow.\" Dr. Ghulam Ali Mallah provided an in-depth overview of Pakistan's diverse educational landscape. He shared that approximately 8 to 9 million students appear annually in board examinations for grades 9 to 12, with increasing interest in international qualifications from British, Swiss, and American boards operating in Pakistan. He underscored the critical role of IBCC in regulating and equating these qualifications and introduced the launch of a new online portal to streamline the credential evaluation process and enhance engagement with global partners. \"Pakistan must not be seen only as a recipient of services,\" Dr. Mallah stated. \"We are ready to act as a global partner in innovation and educational development. We welcome institutions from the UK and beyond to join us in co-creating transformative learning solutions.\" The event featured other notable speakers including Lord Jo Johnson, Member of the House of Lords, UK; Ms. Kirstie Donnelly, CEO of City & Guilds UK; Ms. Gulmina Bilal, Chairperson of NAVTTC Islamabad; and Dr. Amir Saadati, Executive Director of GEMS Middle East. Senior officials from the High Commission for Pakistan in the UK, Vice Chancellors, and renowned educationists also participated in the event. The reception concluded with a shared commitment to promoting inclusive, technology-integrated, and globally benchmarked education systems. The delegates echoed the message that education must be treated not only as a national priority but as a collective global mission to empower future generations.",
