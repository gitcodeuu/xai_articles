    "article_body": "RAWALPINDI, May 21 (APP): At least five people, including three children, were killed and several others injured when a bus carrying school students was targeted in a blast in Balochistan's Khuzdar district on Wednesday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. \"In yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of India and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school going children bus was targeted in Khuzdar\" said an ISPR news release. As per the initial reports, three innocent children and two adults have embraced Shahadat and multiple children have sustained injuries. After having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa. Having failed in the Operation Bunnianum Masroor and being hunted by Pakistan's military and law enforcement agencies, these Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians. Use of terrorism as a state policy by the Indian government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of basic human norms. Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack would be hunted down and brought to justice and heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world. Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of its brave Pakistani nation, stand united to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations.",
