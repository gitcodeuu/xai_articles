The conference was chaired by Pir Hafiz Iqbal Qureshi Naqshbandi, who spoke on the occasion. He urged the people to stay committed to the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah and to work together for national unity. Pir Hafiz Iqbal Qureshi called the creation of Pakistan a miracle and said the country carries the intellectual and spiritual heritage of great Muslim leaders like Mujaddid Alf Sani, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and Maulana Ilyas. He emphasized that Pakistan's defense system is strong, not only because of its nuclear power but also because its armed forces uphold Islamic values. He praised the armed forces for their success in \"Operation Bunyanum Marsoos,\" where he said they defeated a much larger enemy. He also highlighted that the operation was launched with a Quranic verse, showing the army's deep connection with Islam. The conference was also attended by Abdullah Gul, Chairman Tehrik Jawanan Pakistan, along with other notable personalities such as President RIUJ Tariq Virk, Sardar Aftab, and Sardar Zahid.
