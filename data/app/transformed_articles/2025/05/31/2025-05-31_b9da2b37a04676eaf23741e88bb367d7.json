An official told APP that the decision was taken on the special directives of Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi to convert all police stations in Islamabad into Special Initiative Police Stations within 30 days. IG Rizvi said the renovation and up-gradation work at police stations would be completed by June 25. The IG said that the transformation would include improvements in IT infrastructure and human resources to enhance operational efficiency and public service delivery. IG Rizvi said that the police stations would be themed to promote national unity and solidarity, aligning with the vision of citizen-friendly policing. A special committee comprising DIG Islamabad, DIG Headquarters, AIG Logistics, and SSPs of Operations and Investigation has been formed to supervise the initiative.
