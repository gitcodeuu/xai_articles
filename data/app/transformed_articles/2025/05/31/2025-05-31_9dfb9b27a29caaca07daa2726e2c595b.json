    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 31 (APP):Prominent counter terrorism analyst, and President of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), Amir Rana has delivered an insightful lecture at the Institute of Regional Studies, (IRS) Islamabad. The lecture held under the prestigious Eminent Speaker Series, the talk was titled \"Counter terrorism Challenges in Central Asia: A Pakistani Perspective\", said a press release issued here on Saturday. In his address, Rana provided a comprehensive analysis of the shifting security landscape across Central Asia, offering critical insights and lessons for Pakistan as it navigates its own internal and regional counter terrorism challenges. He praised Central Asian states for their firm and consistent policies in tackling violent extremism-particularly their efforts to ban extremist groups and political entities. Pakistan, he stressed, must adopt a similarly resolute and unambiguous approach, and ensure that counter-extremism efforts are holistic and inclusive. \"Terrorism demands a holistic, objective strategy, grounded in both political resolve and societal resilience,\" Rana added. Highlighting persistent threats from groups like ISKP and Al Qaeda, Rana warned against lowering security vigilance, even in periods of relative calm. He noted that transformative extremist currents-from Tunisia to Malaysia-continue to shape global trends, posing potential threats to regional and international stability. A key focus of his talk was the need to further curb any financial infrastructure of terrorism. Rana advocated for enhanced regulatory oversight and intelligence cooperation to ensure a complete cut off of funding to extremists. He further stressed the role of regional platforms, especially the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), in mounting a coordinated response to transnational terrorism and radicalization. \"Security in Central Asia is intrinsically tied to strategic choices in South Asia. What we need is cooperation, not complacency,\" he concluded. The session attracted a diverse audience of scholars, diplomats, policy experts, and practitioners, sparking an engaging discussion on shared regional threats and the future of counter terrorism collaboration. The Institute of Regional Studies continues to serve as a key forum for fostering dialogue on Pakistan's strategic priorities, bringing together experts and stakeholders for meaningful exchanges on issues of national and regional importance.",
