    "article_body": "QUETTA, May 31 (APP):Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif Saturday stressed that the threats faced by Pakistan were no longer confined to conventional warfare and highlighted the need for preparedness across multiple domains. He was addressing officers at the Command and Staff College here. Joined by Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, Federal Ministers Ahsan Iqbal and Attaullah Tarar, Balochistan Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Rahat Naseem Ahmed Khan, and DG ISPR Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Prime Minister outlined a comprehensive vision for national resilience. aPakistanas threats are no longer limited to traditional warfare,a said PM Sharif. aOur military, political, and economic institutions must be equally prepared to face hybrid challenges, from border security to economic sabotage.a He paid tribute to the Pakistan Armed Forces for their valor and professionalism, citing the response to the Pulwama incident as an example of national strength. aWhile India targeted innocent civilians, our Air Force responded with precision, striking seven high-value targets,a he said, adding that the incident proved Pakistanas operational readiness on land and in the air. The Prime Minister strongly criticized Indiaas propaganda and its attempt to weaponize events like the Pulwama attack. He emphasized that Pakistan responded firmly, diplomatically and militarily. aIndia tried to make water a weapon, but we have drawn a red line. Pakistan will never allow its water rights to be violated,a he added. He praised the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar for their strategic foresight, asserting that Pakistanas armed forces and people stand united against any aggression. aThe recent tensions have only boosted the morale of our nation and forces,a he remarked. He noted that when he assumed office for a 16-month tenure, the country was facing severe challenges, but none were insurmountable. aOur focus remains on the economy, reforms, and counterterrorism,a he said. He pointed to significant achievements since the beginning of economic reforms in March 2024. aTax revenue has increased by 28% compared to last year. The introduction of a faceless assessment system at Karachi Port has improved transparency. Inflation has dropped from 38% to single digits. The Pakistani rupee is now stable,a he added. Shehbaz Sharif also emphasized the governmentas zero-tolerance policy on corruption, crediting tough decisions and anti-smuggling measures for economic stabilization. aWe are introducing modern technologies, including crypto regulation and blockchain, to align Pakistan with the global financial landscape,a he announced. He reaffirmed Pakistanas strong ties with countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Qatar, and the Gulf states. aOur strategic friendships have endured every test. These nations stood by us in our most difficult times,a he said. The Prime Minister called for collective national effort and hard work to join the ranks of great nations. aSuccess comes from perseverance. Together, we will transform Pakistan into a model for the world,a he declared.",
