    "article_body": "MOSCOW, May 31 (APP): Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on the sidelines of the Eurasian Forum. During their 40-minutes meeting, Senator Mushahid thanked Russia for maintaining a \"positive and neutral\" role during the recent Pak-India tensions, said a press release received here on Saturday. The meeting took place in Perm, a suburb of Moscow, where Senator Mushahid was attending the Eurasian Forum as the only participant from Pakistan. He was invited by the Russian Foreign Ministry and the ruling United Russia party. Lavrov met Senator Mushahid Hussain as part of a delegation of five prominent Asian leaders, including representatives from China, Turkey, Korea and Cambodia. He will deliver the keynote address at the forum, which brings together over 100 delegates from 25 Eurasian countries. The Russian Foreign Minister stressed that the focus of Russia's foreign policy is to promote peace, security and stability in the region. Senator Mushahid also praised President Putin's Eurasian Security Initiative, which describes security as\" \"indivisible.\" In this regard, he said it is similar to Chinese President Xi Jinping's Global Security Initiative, which adheres to the UN Charter. \"Senator Mushahid rejected the concept of\" \"Asian NATO\" \"or\" \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" \"as they reflect the militarisation of international relations.\" Later, together with other prominent Asian leaders from China, Turkey, South Korea and Cambodia, Senator Mushahid participated in the Eurasian Forum with the Russian Foreign Minister. In his address at the forum, he criticised the two key pro-Western alliances - the Quad and the 'Indo-Pacific Strategy' - in which India has an active role. The criticism reflects Russia's public response to India's pro-Western and anti-China stance. The Russian Foreign Minister's important policy address brought to the fore three fundamental points that are of special importance to Pakistan: First, he criticised the so-called 'Indo-Pacific Strategy' of which India is an important part. \"He said,\" \"The Indo-Pacific has never existed.\" Rather, NATO made it to expose India in its anti-China plans. Secondly, Lavrov indirectly criticised India's participation in the four-nation military alliance Quad (US, Japan, Australia, India) in front of a 12-member strong delegation of India, including three MPs from the BJP. \"On India's entry into the Quad, Lavrov said,\" \"We talked to Indian counterparts who explained that their participation is limited to trade and economy, but in fact the Quad countries are constantly trying to hold joint naval exercises.\" It should be noted that the Indian delegation at the conference was shocked by this unabashed criticism of Lavrov. Swim, Lavrov made another important point regarding Afghanistan. \"Four years after its humiliating retreat, NATO is once again seeking new entrances into Afghanistan,\" he said.\" Moreover, talking to the Russian media, Senator Mushahid Hussain thanked the Russian government and people for their positive role in the recent Pak-India tensions and for their warmth and friendship towards Pakistan. \"Appreciating the efforts of President Putin and President Xi Jinping, he said,\" \"These two strong leaders are moving forward together to build a peaceful and prosperous Eurasia, a dream in which Pakistan will play a key role as an equal partner.\"",
