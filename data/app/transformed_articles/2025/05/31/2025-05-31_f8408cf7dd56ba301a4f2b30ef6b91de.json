    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 31 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced the establishment of the Maritime Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) to promote blue economy and enhance environmental sustainability across the maritime sector. Speaking at the Pakistan Business Council Forum, the Minister emphasized the urgent need to align maritime development with sustainability goals, particularly in the face of growing climate-related challenges in the Global South. He highlighted that Pakistan's coastal regions are vulnerable to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation, which calls for a dedicated platform to drive eco-conscious policy-making, said a press release. The Minister said Maritime Chamber of Commerce and Industry will provide a specialized institutional framework to unify voices across the maritime spectrum, encompassing sectors such as ports, shipping, logistics, fisheries, and marine services. \"This chamber will not only support investment and innovation in the maritime sector but also prioritize sustainability at ports, promote green technologies, and foster carbon reduction strategies,\" Junaid Chaudhry noted. He reiterated the government's commitment to public-private partnerships and welcomed collaboration with environmental experts, industry leaders, and civil society to ensure that maritime growth contributes positively to national and global climate objectives. He reassured the business community that their concerns are being acknowledged and addressed, citing ongoing coordination with the Chief Minister of Sindh to ensure cohesive action at all levels of governance. The Minister also outlined the ministry's roadmap for modernizing Pakistan's port infrastructure, with a focus on digitalization, efficient cargo handling, and environmental sustainability. The Pakistan Business Council strongly supported the move, recognizing the MCCI as a critical step toward building a climate-resilient, economically vibrant maritime economy.",
