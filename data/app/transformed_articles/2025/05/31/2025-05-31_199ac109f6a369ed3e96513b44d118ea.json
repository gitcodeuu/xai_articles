    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 31 (APP): Pakistan on Saturday expressed grave concern over the alarming rise in Islamophobic incidents across India and called upon the Government of India to uphold the rights and safety of all its citizens, regardless of faith. Responding to media queries about increase in Islamophobic incidents across India, the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a press statement said that the targeting of Muslims through hate speech, discriminatory actions, and state complicity was a matter of serious concern for the international community. \"At a time when restraint and reconciliation are most needed, the deliberate incitement of religious hatred for political or ideological purposes violates international human rights obligations and vitiates the prospects for communal harmony, and regional stability,\" the spokesperson added.",
