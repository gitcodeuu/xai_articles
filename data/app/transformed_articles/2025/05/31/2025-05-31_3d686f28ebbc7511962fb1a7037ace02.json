    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 31 (APP):Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal (PBM) in collaboration with the Surgical Oncology Society of Pakistan (SOS-PK) has officially launched the country's first-ever Cancer Awareness Program (P-CAP) in conjunction with the global observance of World No Tobacco Day and in support of the National Anti-Smoking Campaign. P-CAP was conceived by Professor Dr. Zeeshan Danish, Director General of PBM, and launched following the recommendation of Senator Captain (Retired) Khalid Shaheen Butt, Managing Director of PBM. The launch event was successfully organized at the Lahore Press Club by the Regional Director PBM Lahore and his dedicated team. Representing PBM, both Dr. Zeeshan Danish and Senator Capt. Khalid Shaheen Butt emphasized the government's strong commitment to combating cancer through prevention, awareness, early detection, and support for patients and their families. As part of the broader awareness campaign, PBM and SOS-PK will jointly organize a Public Awareness Conference at Ittefaq Hospital on World No Tobacco Day, followed by an Awareness Walk. This walk will include students from medical and pharmacy colleges as well as members of the general public, aiming to promote early diagnosis and highlight the risks of tobacco use in causing cancer and other fatal diseases. PBM's key contributions included creating nationwide awareness about cancer prevention and early detection, promoting access to cancer screening and treatment services, and offering both financial and emotional support to patients and their families. The vision of P-CAP is to create a healthier, cancer-aware Pakistan by raising public awareness, promoting healthy living, and enhancing the national healthcare system's response to cancer. This groundbreaking initiative underscores PBM's strong commitment to public health and marks a significant step toward strengthening the nation's resilience against cancer.",
