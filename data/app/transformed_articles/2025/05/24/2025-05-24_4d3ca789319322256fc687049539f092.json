In a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi here SAturday, it was resolved that First Information Reports (FIRs) will be registered against all deportees. In addition, their passports will be cancelled, and their names will be placed on the Passport Control List (PCL) for a period of five years. The Interior Minister emphasized that the deported individuals were bringing disrepute to Pakistan at the international level, and the government would adopt zero-tolerance policy in this regard. aThere will be no leniency for those who tarnish the countryas image abroad,a Naqvi said.
