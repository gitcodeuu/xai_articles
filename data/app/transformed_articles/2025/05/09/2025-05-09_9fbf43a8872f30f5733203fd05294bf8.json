In a major development, the Islamabad High Court has ruled in favour of the revenue in cases collectively amounting to Rs36.14 billion over the past week, said a press release issued by the FBR here on Friday.

Among the most significant outcomes this week are three significant tax disputes cases including M/s Bahria Town (Pvt) Limited, where the Islamabad High Court upheld revenue claims amounting to Rs26.446 billion. These cases were pending in different appellate for as for the last two and half years. Also, two other corporate cases worth Rs9.7 billion were also decided in favour of FBR by the Islamabad High Court.

More than Rs 3 billion have already been recovered in these cases while FBR is proactively pursuing recovery of the remaining amount, reinforcing its commitment to ensuring compliance and accountability. These successes are a direct result of judicial reforms in the shape of establishment of constitutional benches in the Supreme Courts and High Courts and reflect the commitment of the government under the leadership of the Prime Minister ably assisted by the Attorney General and Chairman Federal Board of Revenue.
