By digitizing the approval process, IBCC is not only accelerating compliance but also reinforcing quality assurance mechanisms across the education spectrum.\" Honourable Ms. Wajeeha Qamar expressed strong support for this initiative, stating, \"This portal brings Pakistan one step closer to international best practices in educational governance. By offering a transparent, user-friendly framework, IBCC is facilitating global academic collaborations while safeguarding national academic standards.\" Officials, national education partners, and representatives of foreign examination boards praised the portal for its role in promoting institutional trust, regulatory clarity, and ease of access. They acknowledged that this development will encourage reputable international boards to operate within Pakistan through a more structured and accountable framework. The launch of the Regulatory Framework Portal is not merely a technological upgrade rather, it is a well-considered move towards aligning global and local educational ecosystems.
