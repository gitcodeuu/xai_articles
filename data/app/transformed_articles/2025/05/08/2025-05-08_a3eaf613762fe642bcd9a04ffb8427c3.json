    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 08 (APP):The Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication, in its meeting on Thursday, expressed full support for Pakistan's armed forces and the families of the martyrs. The meeting was chaired by Senator Palwasha Muhammad Zai Khan and attended by Senators Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, Dr. Afnan Ullah Khan, Dr. Muhammad Humayun Mohmand, Anoosha Rehman, Manzoor Ahmed, and Gurdeep Singh. The committee strongly condemned India's attack on Pakistan that caused the deaths of innocent civilians. Senator Palwasha shared her concerns about receiving threatening messages through her phone, Facebook, and Gmail. She linked these threats to a recent speech where she rejected India's false claims after the Pahalgam attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, which resulted in the deaths of innocent tourists. Her speech was later mentioned in an article by the Hindustan Times. She said that India is using social media to spread false stories and that a cyber war is underway. She stressed that in modern warfare, controlling the narrative can be more damaging than traditional attacks. The chairperson emphasised the importance of national unity and social harmony to counter this form of hybrid warfare. Committee members showed their support for the armed forces and condemned India's targeting of civilians. They agreed that the country is facing a serious situation that requires national unity, patriotism, and resilience. The committee recommended that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) start a public awareness campaign to educate people about cyber threats and the need to stay united.",
