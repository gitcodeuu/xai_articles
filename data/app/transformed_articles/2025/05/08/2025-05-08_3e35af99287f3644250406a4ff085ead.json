    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 08 (APP):The Supreme Court's constitutional bench has referred the contempt of court case against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to a regular bench. The case was heard on Thursday by a five-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan. During the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail questioned whether the case should be handled by their bench or if it falls under the jurisdiction of a regular bench. Advocate Salman Akram Raja, representing the PTI founder, responded that the matter did not involve any constitutional questions and therefore should be referred to a regular bench. The Additional Attorney General supported this stance, noting that in a previous case involving reserved seats, the court had similarly sent the contempt matter to a regular bench. Subsequently, the constitutional bench accepted the arguments and formally referred the contempt of court case against the PTI founder to a regular bench for further proceedings.",
