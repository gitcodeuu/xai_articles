The meeting brought together senior health officials including the Director General Health, CEO of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP), heads of federal hospitals, representatives from the Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority, and health directors from Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The primary objective was to assess national health preparedness and devise strategies to manage any potential emergencies arising from the geopolitical situation. Addressing the participants, Minister Kamal stated, \"We must remain fully prepared for all possible scenarios.
