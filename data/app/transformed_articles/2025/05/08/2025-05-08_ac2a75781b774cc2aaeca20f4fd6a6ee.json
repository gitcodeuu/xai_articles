In a statement issued by JUIF's media cell, on Thursday Fazlur Rehman urged religious scholars and prayer leaders to pass resolutions condemning India's hostility during Friday sermons. He called for national unity in support of Pakistan's Armed Forces, emphasizing the country's readiness to defend its sovereignty. \"We will make every sacrifice for the defense of our homeland,\" he said. \"When it comes to protecting our nation, we stand united.\" He said, \"Our brave armed forces are standing firm with courage and strength against the enemy. The entire nation stands behind them.\" Fazlur Rehman framed national defense as both a duty and a religious obligation, saying, \"Defending the homeland is not just our responsibility-it is our faith's command.\" He added that Pakistan remains a \"fortified wall\" against any aggression.",
