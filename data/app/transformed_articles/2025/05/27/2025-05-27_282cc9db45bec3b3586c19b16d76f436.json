    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 27 (APP):In his ongoing visit to Peoples Republic of China at the invitation of the China National Institute of Shanghai Corporation Organization, Muhammad Rauf Atta President Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan (SCBAP) visited the Shanghai People's High Court, where he met with its Vice President, followed by a visit to the Shanghai Arbitration Commission Centre. According to a press note released here Tuesday, both the aforesaid visits were aimed to study the legal system of the People's Republic of China. It was noted that the entire judicial system of China is primarily based on digitization, relying less on human resources. This allows for instant relief through various digital and technological advancements, including online hearings for all types of cases via mobile phones and introduction of digital courts. Furthermore, the Chinese judicial system places significant emphasis on resolving legal issues through Arbitration Commission Centers, utilizing widely accepted principles of Alternate Dispute Resolution such as settlements, mediation, negotiation, and consultation. As a result, over 8,000 longstanding cases have been resolved. Additionally, the concept of commercial courts has been established, showcasing how AI technological advancements have not only been fully implemented but also integrated into the judicial system. During these visits, President SCBAP also shared that Pakistan's judicial system is rapidly advancing towards digitization, thanks to initiatives taken by the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan. Traditional paper filing of cases has been entirely replaced by an e-filing system for Supreme Court. Moreover, courts in Pakistan are adopting video link facilities to better serve litigants. The Supreme Court of Pakistan is currently offering online hearings via video link, with plans to extend this facility to all high courts and circuit branches soon. Regarding the introduction of Arbitration Councils, President mentioned that while the concept is in place and councils have been established, there is a lack of awareness. The SCBAP, along with other stakeholders, is actively running campaigns to address this issue. In the end, it was emphasized that, despite the progress, much work remains to fully digitize Pakistan's judicial system. Nevertheless, the initiatives taken to enhance the judicial process have received significant appreciation.",
