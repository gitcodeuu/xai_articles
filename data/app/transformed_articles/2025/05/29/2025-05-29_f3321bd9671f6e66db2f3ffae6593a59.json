    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP): Chairman of the Prime Minister's Youth Programme, Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan, on Thursday stated that Pakistani youth have outperformed India in the domains of fifth-generation warfare and cybersecurity, effectively countering hostile narratives and cyber threats. Addressing a ceremony at Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) to mark Youm-e-Takbeer he said \"Our youth stood resilient, defeating Indian attempts to sow hatred and division\". Highlighting Pakistan's historical stance on sovereignty, Rana Mashhood drew parallels between the 1998 nuclear tests conducted under intense international pressure and Pakistan's recent firm response to Indian aggression. \"Back then, it was an 'Absolutely Not' to global pressure, and we are showing that same strength again and once again\", he said. He stated the government is investing in empowering youth through the Prime Minister's Youth Programme, which includes the launch of a Digital Youth Hub, offering information on scholarships, employment, and skill-building opportunities. He also noted that consultations on Pakistan's first National Youth and Adolescent Policy are in their final phase. Reflecting on past initiatives, Rana Mashhood credited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's earlier efforts as Punjab Chief Minister, such as the laptop scheme and scholarships, as part of a broader vision to invest in the youth. Commenting on recent hostilities, he stated that the Pakistani nation had displayed unprecedented unity in the face of Indian aggression, countering divisive fifth-generation warfare tactics. He lauded the Pakistani media for effectively challenging Indian propaganda, claiming global recognition for Pakistan's narrative. He also revealed that PM Shehbaz Sharif had recently visited allied countries to thank them for their diplomatic and moral support during the recent Pakistan-India standoff. He said Pakistan managed to down six Indian aircraft, including Rafale jets, and inflicted damage on India's S-400 defense systems during the conflict. He claimed that Pakistan has emerged victorious not only militarily but also in the fields of economy and technology. The chairman asserted that many foreign companies are now turning away from India and are seeking to invest in Pakistan. He announced that 600,000 young individuals will receive vocational training under the youth programme next year to meet the country's development needs and attract international investment. Rana Mashhood reiterated that Pakistan desires peace but remains resolute in defending its sovereignty. \"If India dares to stop our water, we will respond decisively-even beyond our borders,\" he warned. He stressed that lasting peace in the region cannot be achieved without a resolution of the Kashmir dispute in line with UN Security Council resolutions. Also speaking at the ceremony, Major General (Retd.) Zahid Mehmood described Youm-e-Takbeer as a symbol of the Pakistani nation's unwavering resolve.He urged youth to learn from history and take responsibility for the country's future. He recalled that Pakistan established strategic nuclear balance in 1998 and emphasized the need to strengthen cultural, religious, and social values to resist external threats.He claimed that India has now been rendered irrelevant following its failed aggression and said it will no longer dare to challenge Pakistan militarily.He declared that the nation stands united on core issues such as Kashmir and water rights. President of ICCI, Nasir Mehmood Qureshi, along with former ICCI presidents Zafar Bakhtawari and Akram Farid, also addressed the gathering. They paid tribute to the Pakistan Armed Forces for their response to Indian hostilities. A moment of silence was observed during the ceremony to honor the martyrs and brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the motherland.",
