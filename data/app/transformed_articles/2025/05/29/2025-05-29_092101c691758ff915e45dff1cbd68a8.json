Speaking at a press conference held at the National Press Club, Dr. Sultan Zeb, Dr. Sarwar Malik, and Dr. Tayyab Saeed highlighted key causes of digestive issues, including the consumption of unhealthy, high-fat foods, inadequate water intake, and irregular lifestyles. They further noted that mental stress, smoking, and alcohol consumption significantly contribute to worsening digestive conditions.
