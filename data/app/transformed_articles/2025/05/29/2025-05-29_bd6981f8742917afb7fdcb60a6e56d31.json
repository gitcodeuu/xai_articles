    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP):The Senate Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs on Thursday discussed the feasibility and implementation of internet voting systems, particularly for overseas Pakistanis, focusing on ensuring accessibility, security, and electoral integrity. The meeting, chaired by Senator Dr. Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, underscored the importance of facilitating the participation of overseas citizens in the democratic process without compromising the transparency and reliability of elections. Committee members deliberated on both the technical and legal implications of internet voting, considering international practices and the evolving needs of Pakistan's electoral landscape. The discussion also included a comparative analysis of the existing first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system and the potential advantages of transitioning to a proportional representation model to ensure broader representation and inclusivity. Senators Mohsin Aziz, Khalil Tahir, Khalida Ateeb, Pervaiz Rasheed, and Kamran Murtaza participated in the meeting. Senior officials from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs were also present to provide technical input and respond to queries.",
