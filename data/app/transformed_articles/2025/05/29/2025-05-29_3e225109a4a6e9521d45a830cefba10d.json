    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP): The National Emergencies Operations Centre (NEOC) warned Thursday that five separate weather systems are expected to trigger thunderstorms, strong winds, hailstorms, and heavy downpours across various parts of the country, with Islamabad and Rawalpindi facing particularly severe conditions.

NDMA urges all provincial and district authorities to ensure emergency preparedness, remain vigilant, and coordinate with local response units for timely action. The Authority will continue to monitor the evolving situation and provide timely updates. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a public advisory urging caution amid ongoing severe weather conditions. Citizens are advised to avoid unnecessary travel, particularly in hilly and flood-prone areas, secure weak structures, trees, power lines, and solar panels, and park vehicles in safe, covered locations. Farmers should take precautions to protect standing crops from potential hailstorms and gusty winds. Travelers and tourists are advised to exercise vigilance during outdoor and mountain excursions. For real-time weather updates, NDMA recommends using the \"Pak NDMA Disaster Alert\" App. According to NEOC, two major weather systems are merging towards the twin cities, where wind gusts and intense rainfall are expected between 6 pm to 11 pm today. Scattered hailstorms, windstorms, and heavy rain are also anticipated in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), North Punjab, and South Eastern Punjab. In Southern Punjab, a slow-moving system is active over the Rohi area of Rahim Yar Khan. This system is gradually extending towards Rahim Yar Khan city, Sadiqabad, and Minthar, bringing light to moderate rainfall. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, an active weather system stretches from Peshawar to Parachinar, featuring thunderstorms, gusty winds, and heavy rain. This system is expected to affect Peshawar, Darra Adam Khel, and surrounding areas. Azad Jammu and Kashmir is also under the influence of an active weather system extending from Muzaffarabad into the Neelum Valley, bringing rainfall and potential storm activity.",
