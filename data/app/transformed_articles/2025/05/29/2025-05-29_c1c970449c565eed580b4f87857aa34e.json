    "article_body": "RAWALPINDI, May 29 (APP): Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), interacted with vice chancellors, principals, and senior faculty members of various universities. According to an ISPR news release, the COAS said that teachers are the greatest asset of Pakistan. Whatever I am today is because of my parents and teachers. He said that the character-building of future generations is the primary responsibility of teachers and urged them to narrate Pakistan's true story to the younger generations. Speaking about the \"Marka-e-Haq,\" the COAS said that Allah Almighty has always helped Pakistan in every possible way. \"The battle of Marka-e-Haq is proof that when an entire nation stands united like an iron wall, no power in the world can defeat it,\" he said. The COAS reaffirmed Pakistan's unwavering stance on Kashmir, declaring, \"No compromise on Kashmir is possible; we can never forget Kashmir. India must realize that Pakistan will never abandon Kashmir.\" He further said that water is Pakistan's red line. \"We will not compromise on this fundamental right of 240 million Pakistanis,\" he warned. Syed Asim Munir made it clear that Pakistan will never accept India's supremacy. He said that while India has tried to suppress the Kashmir issue for decades, it has failed-and now, this suppression is no longer possible. He described terrorism in India as an internal problem rooted in increasing oppression and prejudice against minorities, especially Muslims. Kashmir is an international issue, he added. The COAS said that the terrorists in Balochistan are the \"Fitna al-Hindustan\" and have no connection with the Baloch people. \"We must build Pakistan into a strong state where all institutions function in accordance with the law and Constitution-free from political pressure, personal interests, or financial motives-and work solely for the welfare of the people,\" he said. The Field Marshal underscored that elements propagating narratives that weaken the state of Pakistan will be rejected. During the Q&A session, participants expressed their sentiments, saying: \"Yeh jo mehfooz dharti hai, is ke peechay wardi hai\" (This safe homeland is secured by the uniform). They added, \"We are proud of Pakistan and our armed forces, and we will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.\"",
