    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP):The Establishment Division has given its consent to the upgradation of the FIA employees in the contempt of court case pending before it. Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri heard the contempt case regarding non-implementation of the court order regarding the upgradation of FIA employees. During the hearing, the Ministry of Interior and Establishment officials appeared in the court. The court inquired whether the court order is implemented or not. On this occasion, a representative of the Establishment Division presented a letter in the court and informed that we have no objection to the upgradation of the employees but an intra-court appeal is pending. Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri said that the pending intra-court appeal has no effect on our order. The court adjourned the hearing of the contempt of court case. The court had ordered the upgradation of FIA employees from constable to assistant sub-inspector.",
