    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP): National Assembly Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination on Thursday discussed issues of regulation of food standards, healthcare facilities and recruitment practices. The meeting which was held under the chairmanship of Dr. Mahesh Kumar Malani, MNA, expressed concerns over the Ministry of Science and Technology's delay in addressing unresolved matters related to food product standards, particularly the introduction of front-of-package warnings. Recognizing the adverse health impacts of ultra-processed foods, the Committee recommended imposing a levy on such products. The revenue generated would support health promotion initiatives aimed at combating non-communicable diseases. The issue of administrative inefficiencies and recruitment delays at institutions like Federal Government Polyclinic hospital and the Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority (IHRA) was also discussed in depth. Members urged immediate action to ensure transparency and fairness in hiring practices. The Committee directed the Ministry to submit detailed reports on recruitment processes and measures to enhance institutional accountability in the next meeting. A significant portion of the meeting revolved around the working and performance of the Drug Regulatory Authority Pakistan (DRAP). The Committee highlighted the acute shortage of resources, pending recruitments and the need for a robust regulatory framework to address pharmaceutical malpractice. It was recommended that rules for filling vacant positions in DRAP be expedited, alongside efforts to strengthen inspection mechanisms for pharmaceutical products and vaccines. Members also stressed the importance of harmonizing drug licensing procedures to reduce delays and ensure the availability of quality-assured medicines. The Committee urged DRAP to adopt a more proactive approach in monitoring drug efficacy, availability and pricing to safeguard public health interests. The Committee Members also recommended enhancing the existing penalties for non-compliance of standards. Additionally, the need to prioritize local manufacturing of essential vaccines was emphasized to minimize reliance on imports and ensure a steady supply. The Committee commended DRAP for its efforts to digitize the drug licensing application process. It was noted that a standardized harmonized form has been developed to streamline licensing procedures. The Committee emphasized the importance of establishing clear and stringent rules for drug licensing to enhance transparency and efficiency. The Committee directed DRAP to share the finalized licensing rules in the next meeting. The Committee disposed off 'The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (Amendment) Bill, 2024', (moved by Ms. Shaista Pervaiz, MNA/Mover) whereas, 'The Islamabad Healthcare Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2024', (moved by Ms. Shaista Pervaiz, MNA/Mover) and 'The Pharmacy (Amendment) Bill, 2024', (moved by Mr. Abdul Qadir Patel, MNA) were deferred due to absence of movers.",
