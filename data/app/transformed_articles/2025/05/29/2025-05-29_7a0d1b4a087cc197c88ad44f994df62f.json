This was stated by the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman), Ejaz Ahmad Qureshi, while addressing a webinar on \"Ombudsmanship: Complying with the International Standards\", at the Wafaqi Mohtasib Secretariat, here Thursday. Ejaz Ahmad Qureshi, who is also the current President of the 47-member strong Asian Ombudsman Association, said that it is a matter of great satisfaction that the institution of Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman) has emerged as a reliable forum to address public grievances expeditiously and without any financial costs.
