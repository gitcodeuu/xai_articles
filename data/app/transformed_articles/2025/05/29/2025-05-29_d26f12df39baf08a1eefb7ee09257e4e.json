    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP):Ambassador of China to Pakistan, Mr. Jiang Zaidong Thursday stressed the vital role of science and technology in solving today's global challenges, describing institutions like NUST as \"the need of the hour.\" He made these remarks during a visit to the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), where he praised the university's innovation-driven academic environment and advanced research facilities, drawing a favorable comparison with China's renowned Tsinghua University. The Ambassador's visit marked a significant step toward deepening bilateral academic cooperation between Pakistan and China. He echoed the need for enhanced academic and research linkages, particularly in the social sciences, and emphasized the importance of experience-sharing across academic, governmental, and cultural platforms. Welcoming the dignitary, Rector NUST Dr Muhammad Zahid Latif termed the occasion a \"historic day\" and expressed hope that it would pave the way for long-term collaboration between Chinese and Pakistani academic institutions. He highlighted NUST's ongoing partnerships with several Chinese universities but called for greater diplomatic facilitation to further strengthen and streamline these ties. The Rector also announced the upcoming launch of the Jinnah School of Public Policy & Leadership, aimed at promoting evidence-based policymaking in light of regional and global developments. During his tour, Ambassador Jiang was briefed on key initiatives at NUST and visited the National Centre of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) and the School of Interdisciplinary Engineering and Sciences (SINES). He witnessed the university's work in emerging technologies and interdisciplinary innovation, and engaged in a lively exchange with students, encouraging them to pursue academic excellence and become agents of progress.",
