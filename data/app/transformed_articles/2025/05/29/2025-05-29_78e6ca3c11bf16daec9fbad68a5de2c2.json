    "article_body": "LACHIN, May 29 (APP):Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that Pakistan was ready to receive $2 billion investment from Azerbaijan in multiple sectors. The prime minister, talking to Azerbaijan TV prior to his departure from Lachin to Dushanbe after winding up his three-day visit, said that during their meeting, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had reiterated his country's commitment to invest $2 billion in Pakistan. \"Yesterday, President Ilham Aliyev again reiterated his commitment to invest $2 billion in Pakistan. We are ready for this investment for mutual benefits,\" he said. Referring to his participation in a ceremony of Azerbaijan's Independence Day held on Wednesday, the prime minister said that May 28 was also a very important day for Pakistan as the country became a nuclear power on that date in 1998. He said Azerbaijan was a \"brotherly and great\" country which had completely transformed under the \"dynamic\" leadership of President Ilham Aliyev. Prime Minister Shehbaz said that during their meeting, both sides discussed joint cooperation in trade, commerce and investment. In the future, both countries will have more coordination in commerce, defence production, education, health and many other sectors.",
