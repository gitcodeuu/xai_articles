    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP): Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Islamabad Police, Muhammad Jawad Tariq, on Thursday chaired a high-level meeting to review security arrangements and crime prevention strategies in the federal capital ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. An official told APP that the meeting was attended by SSP Operations Muhammad Shoaib Khan, Zonal SPs, and SDPOs, who briefed the DIG on the current law and order situation and the overall security plan for Eid. DIG Tariq said that special arrangements must be made for Chand Raat and Eid days, with a strong emphasis on marketplace security and public safety. \"A comprehensive crackdown will be launched against criminal elements, while foot, vehicle, and motorcycle patrolling must be intensified across all areas of the city,\" he said. DIG Tariq said strict checking will be ensured at all entry and exit points of the capital, and special attention will be given to the security of important buildings and places of worship. DIG said that all patrolling units-including Dolphin Force, Ababeel, and Emergency Response Units-must enhance their effectiveness in every sector of Islamabad. \"No one will be allowed to display weapons publicly, and strict legal action will be taken against violators,\" he added. DIG Tariq said that officers must strengthen mutual coordination and ensure timely information sharing for operational efficiency. \"The protection of citizens' lives and property, and provision of every possible facility to them, is our top priority,\" he said. Tariq said a proper check and balance should be maintained over all field personnel and encouraged officers to appreciate and support their subordinates' efforts. He also instructed that steps be taken for the welfare of the police force during the Eid holidays.",
