During the meeting, the two sides expressed satisfaction over the positive developments in bilateral relations following the recent visit of Pakistan's Prime Minister to Uzbekistan. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi emphasized the importance of exchanging trade delegations to enhance economic cooperation and bring stability through strengthened commercial ties. The leaders also agreed to explore the extension of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan railway project through Peshawar, aiming to improve regional connectivity. Furthermore, they discussed the launch of direct flights between Islamabad and Tashkent to facilitate travel and strengthen people-to-people contact. Ambassador Alisher proposed expanding trade in quality sports goods produced in both countries and expressed interest in Uzbek construction companies operating in Pakistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He highlighted the educational ties as well, saying that around 3,000 Pakistani students are currently studying in Uzbek institutions.
