    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 30 (APP):The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) of Islamabad on Friday indicted six more Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters in a case related to the violent protests that followed the arrest of the party's founder on May 9. The hearing took place at the Anti-Terrorism Court in Islamabad, where Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra framed charges against the six accused. They denied the allegations during the proceedings. This case stems from the events of May 9, 2023, when PTI workers across the country staged violent protests after the arrest of the former party chief outside the Islamabad High Court. The protests led to attacks on several government buildings and military sites. According to police, a total of 48 individuals are now formally charged in the case. Charges had already been filed against 42 people before, while the court has now added six more names to the list of accused. The case is being heard in connection with an FIR registered at Shams Colony Police Station, which relates to the incidents of arson and vandalism during the protests. The court has adjourned the proceedings until July 3, when it will resume hearings. The May 9 protests included demonstrations outside the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, where PTI supporters damaged security barriers and other installations. In Lahore, the historic Jinnah House was attacked and set on fire. In Peshawar, the state-run Radio Pakistan building was also torched. Several other public buildings across cities were damaged in the unrest. Following the unrest, police launched a crackdown on PTI workers and supporters involved in the violence. Dozens have been arrested and are now facing trial in various cities, with some cases being heard in anti-terrorism courts due to the nature of the charges. The government has stated that those involved in planning or executing the attacks on public property and military sites will be prosecuted under strict laws, including anti-terrorism legislation.",
