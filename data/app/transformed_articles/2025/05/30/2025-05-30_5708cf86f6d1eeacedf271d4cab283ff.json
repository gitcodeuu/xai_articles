    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 30 (APP):The Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) Friday commemorated the first anniversary of Pakistan's communication satellite, PAKSAT MM1, which was successfully launched into geostationary orbit on May 30, 2024. The satellite has now completed one year of successful operation and continues to play a transformative role in advancing national connectivity, digital access, and secure communications across the country. Developed and launched in collaboration with China, PAKSAT MM1 represents a major milestone in Pakistan's journey toward technological self-reliance and digital inclusion. Over the past year, the satellite has significantly contributed to expanding high-speed broadband services, enabling digital connectivity in remote and underserved areas, and supporting national efforts in sectors such as telecommunication, e-learning, telemedicine, and disaster response. Through its advanced high-throughput capacity, PAKSAT MM1 has enhanced Pakistan's ability to provide reliable satellite-based internet and communication services to regions where traditional terrestrial infrastructure remains limited. It has supported government and private sector initiatives to bridge the digital divide and empower local communities with access to modern communication tools. On this occasion, the Chairman SUPARCO expressed pride in the achievements of PAKSAT MM1 and emphasized its importance for Pakistan. He remarked that the satellite stands as a symbol to the nation's dedication to space technology and its vision for a connected, resilient, and technologically empowered Pakistan.",
