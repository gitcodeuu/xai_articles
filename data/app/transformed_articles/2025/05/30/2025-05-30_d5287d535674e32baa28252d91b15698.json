    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 30 (APP):The DASTAK Women Rights and Awareness Foundation has been honored with the 2025 Nelson Mandela-Graca Machel Innovation Award in the Organisation Category by the CIVICUS World Alliance for Citizen Participation. The award recognizes DASTAK's groundbreaking work in advancing gender-responsive climate justice through its FIERCE initiative. The FIERCE (Feminist Initiative for Environmental Resilience, Collective Care, and Well-being of Eco-Justice Defenders) initiative redefines climate action by centering the lived experiences, emotions, and knowledge of grassroots defenders, particularly women in Pakistan and the Global South. Emerging from the devastating 2022 floods in Pakistan, DASTAK's approach challenges extractive narratives and instead amplifies the voices of those most affected by climate crises. In a statement, CIVICUS praised DASTAK for embodying the vision of Nelson Mandela and Graca Machel, stating: \"These innovators live up to a belief in people power and justice grounded in dignity and imagination. Their work inspires new paths forward for civil society and the world.\" Hira Amjad, Founder and Executive Director of DASTAK Foundation, expressed gratitude, saying: \"This award recognizes the power of care, community, and grassroots knowledge in our work. It affirms that decolonized, gender-responsive climate action is not only necessary but effective and urgent. This moment belongs to every climate defender and survivor building liberation with love.\" Presented by CIVICUS, the Nelson Mandela-Graca Machel Innovation Awards honor individuals and organizations using innovative approaches to tackle pressing global challenges.",
