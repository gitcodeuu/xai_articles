    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 30 (APP):Health and policy experts, government officials and civil society representatives, on Friday emphasised the urgent implementation of Front-of-Pack Warning Labels (FOPWL) on packaged foods in a bid to tackle country's growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). They expressed these views at a National Roundtable Consultation, co-hosted by Heartfile and the Pakistan National Heart Association (PANAH) here, said a press release. The event brought together stakeholders from federal and provincial health and food departments, food regulators, public health organizations, and academia. They emphasized that over 60% of all deaths in Pakistan are linked to NCDs such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and hypertension. According to experts, poor dietary habits, particularly the rising intake of ultra-processed foods high in sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, are a major contributing factor. Speakers at the event said that FOPWLs-simple, black octagonal warning signs displayed on the front of packaging-have shown global success, particularly in countries like Chile, Mexico and Brazil, where they have led to a decline in the consumption of unhealthy food products and encouraged food manufacturers to reformulate their products to meet healthier standards. Dr Saba Amjad of Heartfile and Sana Ullah Ghumman of PANAH were joined by other experts in stressing the need for a scientifically grounded Nutrient Profile Model (NPM) to objectively determine which products require warning labels. Dr Saba said, \"We must not allow commercial interests to override public health. Every day we delay these reforms, more lives are lost to preventable diseases.\" Sana Ullah Ghumman of PANAH said, \"This is not just a health issue; it's a national emergency. The government must act now to protect the lives and well-being of our people.\" They urged the government to adopt a broader set of evidence-based food and health policy reforms. These include not only the immediate implementation of FOPWLs but also increased excise taxes on ultra-processed food and beverage products in the upcoming Finance Bill 2025-26, strict regulations on marketing to children, and a ban on unhealthy food availability in public institutions, particularly schools. The experts emphasized that the current situation represents both a public health emergency and an economic threat. In addition to health impacts, participants highlighted the social and economic dimensions of diet-related diseases. Poor dietary practices are contributing to the intergenerational cycle of poverty by affecting the cognitive and physical development of children, reducing educational outcomes, and increasing the financial burden on already struggling households. Several speakers noted that the front-of-pack label system is not merely a regulatory change, but a critical health intervention that empowers consumers to make better food choices. The event concluded with a strong note that the adoption of FOPWLs, combined with fiscal policies, marketing restrictions, and institutional regulations, could play a transformative role in reversing the tide of diet-related diseases in the country.",
