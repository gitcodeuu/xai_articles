    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 30 (APP):A section of a pedestrian bridge at Khanewal Railway Station collapsed, prompting immediate action from Federal Minister for Railways, Muhammad Hanif Abbasi. Taking notice of the incident, the minister has suspended three railway officials and ordered a high-level inquiry. According to a notification, among those suspended are Divisional Engineer Abid Razaq (Grade 18), Assistant Engineer Raja Yousuf (Grade 17), and Bridge Inspector Multan Muhammad Adil (Grade 16). Minister Abbasi expressed regret over the incident and issued firm directives for strict action against those found responsible. He emphasized the need for accountability to prevent such occurrences in the future. An inquiry committee has been constituted, comprising the Chief Executive Officer of Pakistan Railways, the Inspector General of Railway Police, and the Divisional Superintendent of Lahore. The committee is tasked with determining the cause of the collapse and identifying any negligence. CEO Pakistan Railways Aamir Ali Baloch has departed for Khanewal to oversee the situation personally.
