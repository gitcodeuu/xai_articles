    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, May 30 (APP):With Eid ul Azha approaching, the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration has reviewed the city's preparations to manage cattle markets, traffic, security, and sanitation. In this regard, a high-level meeting, chaired by the Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa discussed the arrangements to ensure a smooth and organized holiday for residents. The meeting was attended by Deputy Commissioner Islamabad, DIG Islamabad, Chief Traffic Officer, SSP Safe City, Director DMA, MCI officials, and all Assistant Commissioners. The meeting focused on reviewing the setup and management of cattle markets across the federal capital. Participants were briefed on parking, traffic flow, and security measures around the livestock sale points. According to the briefing by DC Islamabad, a total of six official cattle markets have been established in various parts of the city. These designated sites will be the only legal spots where the sale and purchase of sacrificial animals are allowed. Any such activity outside these approved areas will not be permitted. Chief Commissioner and other senior officials were informed that magistrates have been appointed at all six markets to respond to any complaints or issues raised by the public. This step is intended to ensure immediate redressal and smooth functioning of the markets. Security preparations were another key part of the meeting. DIG Islamabad informed the participants that tight security measures have been planned across the city during Eid days. Additional police personnel will be deployed at all cattle markets and major locations to maintain order and respond to any untoward incidents. The meeting also reviewed the arrangements for Eid prayers. Officials discussed the preparations at various Eidgahs and large mosques across the city to accommodate prayer gatherings. Measures related to crowd control and safety during prayers were reviewed in detail. Another important point discussed was the post-Eid sanitation operation. After the animal sacrifices, proper disposal of waste remains a major concern. Officials gave a detailed briefing on how offal and animal waste will be collected and removed. Specific plans have been put in place to manage this task efficiently, and sanitation workers will be on duty immediately after Eid prayers. Director DMA and MCI representatives shared the coordination plan between various departments to ensure that waste collection and disposal operations are carried out without delays. The Chief Commissioner directed all departments to work jointly to maintain cleanliness across the city. The meeting concluded with a clear message from the Chief Commissioner that all departments must stay alert and responsive during Eid days. He said the focus is on managing the flow of traffic, providing a safe environment for animal trade, securing public gatherings, and ensuring quick removal of waste after sacrifices. Officials stressed that cooperation from citizens is also essential. They advised residents to buy animals only from designated markets, avoid illegal roadside sales, and report any irregularities to the administration.",
