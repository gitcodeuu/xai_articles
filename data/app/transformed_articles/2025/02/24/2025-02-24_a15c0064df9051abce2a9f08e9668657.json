He mentioned LNG as another trading commodity which could be added in the trading pool, besides broadening the defence cooperation. \"If we put our acts together, we can achieve $2 billion trade volume between the two countries,\" he stressed.

The prime minister announced constitution of a permanent bureau in Pakistan, comprising both sides to work in this regard with the assistance of AI and real time information, assuring that effective mechanism would be put in place. The teams should work out a robust mechanism, which alone could help them in a big way, he added. He said that the defence cooperation between the two countries had already been there and they further discussed to strengthen it. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif opined that the North-South Corridor would be an efficient, reliable and cost- effective transportation means of connectivity initiative which would help achieve their targets. The Gwadar Port would play a very pivotal role as a game-changer, he said and assured to work closely on this project. He said Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce had established its office in Islamabad and also its offshoots in Pakistan, adding that Pakistan would also establish such like office in Baku which would be helpful in collecting information about the potential of trade and investment. There were enormous opportunities on both sides which should be fully explored, he emphasized. The prime minister also thanked President Ilham Aliyev for his great love and fondness for the people of Pakistan and expressed his gratitude for sending experts teams to Islamabad, who had been doing a wonderful job in improving the landscaping there and adding beauty to Pakistan's Capital.
