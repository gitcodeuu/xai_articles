    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 26 (APP):Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the Islamabad High Court on Wednesday urged the students to focus on their education for leading the country towards development. He said that there was a big gap in country system, adding that the lawyers should come court after comprehensive preparation of cases. The Millennium National Moot Court Competition was organized at The Millennium Universal College in Islamabad, in which law students presented their cases as lawyers, while Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan of the Islamabad High Court, Advocate General Islamabad Ayaz Shaukat and others performed the duties as judges. Addressing the students as the special guest, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani said that there is a lot of gap in the country's legal system and stressed that lawyers should appear in the courts with full preparation, otherwise the results will be the same as they are seen at the moment. He urged universities to educate students about the Civil Procedure Court because Pakistan has every law but the law needs to be implemented. He said that a new generation is needed to improve the entire model of governance, people above the age of 45 have done what they had to do, now the new generation has to take over the reins of the country. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani urged the students to speak the truth and work honestly, because this is the path that will take them to the leadership of the country after the age of 45. He urged the students to reject drugs and corruption while focusing on their education and allocating only one hour for studies daily.",
