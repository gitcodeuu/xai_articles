    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 26 (APP):The lower court on Wednesday adjourned the hearing in the case involving threats against a female judge by the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Mureed Abbas adjourned the proceedings due to pending approval for a jail trial, with no response yet from the Islamabad High Court. The case, registered at Margalla Police Station, accuses the PTI founder of threatening Judge Zeba Chaudhry. During the recent hearing, the court noted that it had written to the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for a jail trial but had not received a response. As a result, no further action could be taken, and the hearing was adjourned until March 12.",
