    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 21 (APP):COMSTECH (The OIC Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation) and ICESCO (Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) have agreed to hold a joint conference of ministers of education to explore new dimensions in education, with a special focus on STEM education. The initiative aligns with the vision of Pakistan's Federal Minister for Science, Technology, and Federal Education, Dr Maqbool Siddiqui, who emphasizes the role of science and technology in shaping the future of education. The conference will also focus on supporting Palestine in rebuilding its infrastructure and human capacity, ensuring access to quality education and scientific development. This was discussed and agreed upon during a high-level meeting in Rabat, Morocco, between Coordinator General of COMSTECH, Prof Dr Muhammad Iqbal Choudhary, and Director General of ICESCO, Dr Salim M AlMalik. Both leaders also agreed to collaborate in the health sector, particularly on neglected tropical diseases, with a focus on supporting the least-developed African countries. In addition to educational and health-care initiatives, it was also discussed to jointly launch the Science in Africa Program and work together on various scholarship programs to empower students and researchers across the region. This collaboration marks a significant step in promoting scientific innovation, education, and health-care in OIC member states, reflecting a shared commitment to sustainable development and global progress.",
