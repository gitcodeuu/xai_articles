President Asif Ali Zardari, who is on an official visit to China, in his statement, said that Pakistan lost a great friend, who had made great contributions towards the uplift of Pakistan's social sector, particularly in the health, education and community development. \"The invaluable services of Prince Karim Aga Khan for humanity will always be remembered\", President Secretariat Press Wing, in a press release, quoted the president as saying. The president termed Prince Karim Aga Khan's demise as a monumental loss, saying that words could not adequately express his sorrow at the loss of such a devoted friend of Pakistan.

He expressed the hope that the new spiritual leader would follow in his esteemed father's footsteps, setting new benchmarks for service and humanity.",
