    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 11 (APP):Telenor Pakistan recorded an impressive 12.0% growth in service revenue during the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by the continued success of its monetization strategy. According to Telenor Group's Q4 2024 financial results, the company's average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 13.0%, effectively offsetting a 2.7% decline in the subscription base. This aligns with Telenor Pakistan's strategic focus on acquiring high-quality customers and maintaining controlled churn. On the cost front, a decline in fuel prices helped ease macroeconomic pressures observed earlier in the year. Coupled with ongoing cost-optimization efforts and strong top-line growth, the company achieved a solid 25.2% increase in EBITDA during the period. \"We also saw impressive performance by our business in Pakistan. If we look a little bit into the year and the fourth quarter for that matter, I'd like to give honour to our people, particularly in Pakistan, where we know that the situation has been very difficult for somewhat different reasons. But I'm really impressed and proud to see what our people have delivered,\" Said Benedicte Schilbred Fasmer, CEO of Telenor Group.",
