    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 28 (APP):Chairperson Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid, held a meeting with Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Principal Social Protection Specialist, Ms Xin Long, at BISP Headquarters on Wednesday to explore avenues for providing employment opportunities through skill training and non-formal education to BISP beneficiaries. The meeting aimed to strengthen cooperation in empowering deserving households through skill-based initiatives, particularly under the Benazir Hunarmand Programme. Both sides discussed the importance of enhancing maternal and child health, nutrition measures, and educational stipends for children of registered families. Senator Rubina Khalid emphasized that economic uplift of vulnerable communities requires equipping individuals with market-relevant skills and non-formal education aligned with international standards. She highlighted the need for internationally certified training to ensure that beneficiaries not only secure jobs in the local market but also gain access to employment opportunities abroad. \"There is a high global demand for skilled labor, and by providing quality certifications along with skill training, we can empower deserving individuals to stand on their own feet, break free from poverty, and contribute positively to the national economy,\" said Senator Rubina Khalid. Ms Xin Long praised BISP's efforts in launching skills development initiatives under the Benazir Hunarmand Programme and acknowledged the pivotal role of social protection in transforming lives. She assured that the ADB would continue supporting BISP in expanding skill training programmes, improving maternal and child health outcomes, and strengthening social safety nets for marginalized communities. The meeting reaffirmed both sides' commitment to inclusive economic empowerment and poverty alleviation through sustainable social protection initiatives.",
