A continental air system is prevailing over most regions, keeping the weather dry. However, a shallow westerly wave is expected to approach the western parts of the country from tomorrow evening or night, which may bring slight changes in weather patterns. In the past 24 hours, cold and dry conditions dominated most areas, with isolated rain and snowfall recorded in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. According to PMD, Dir (Upper) received 4mm of rainfall, while Pattan recorded 2mm.
