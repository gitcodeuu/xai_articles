    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 22 (APP):A high-level delegation from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) met with Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) Muhammad Ali Randhawa to discuss key development projects, including the establishment of the Islamabad Inter-City Bus Terminal. During the meeting, Chairman Randhawa was briefed on the completion of the preliminary feasibility report for the Islamabad Inter-City Bus Terminal project. The proposed terminal is set to integrate with the city's existing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and electric bus services, aiming to enhance urban mobility and reduce traffic congestion in the federal capital. Chairman Randhawa emphasized the need for ADB to develop a comprehensive financial model for the project, which will also include charging infrastructure to support electric buses. He further highlighted the importance of ADB's technical expertise in preparing the Islamabad Transport Master Plan, a long-term strategy to modernize the city's transportation network. In addition, the Chairman urged ADB to assist in securing carbon credits for environmentally sustainable initiatives, underscoring the CDA's commitment to green urban development. The meeting concluded with Chairman Randhawa reaffirming CDA's dedication to collaborating with ADB on the construction and development of Islamabad, ensuring the city's growth aligns with modern urban planning standards and environmental sustainability.",
