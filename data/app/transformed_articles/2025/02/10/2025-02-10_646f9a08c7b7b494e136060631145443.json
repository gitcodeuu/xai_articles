    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 10 (APP):Prime Minister's Coordinator, Rana Ehsan Afzal said on Monday that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), as a democratic party, has always supported dialogue in the national interest. Talking to a private news channel, he highlighted that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had repeatedly invited by PML-N for dialogue in the past to maintain democracy and improve the economy. PTI's sole objective was to achieve a National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO), he added. Afzal further stated that PTI's agenda in these discussions was always focused on securing an NRO for former chairman. He also criticized PTI for threatening to create anarchy when they realized the ruling party was focused on dialogue in the national interest.
