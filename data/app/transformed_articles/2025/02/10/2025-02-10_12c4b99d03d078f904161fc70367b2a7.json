Similarly, no information about development of any new run-of-river project or any other project under the provisions of the Treaty is shared by India with Pakistan. Speaking in the National Assembly during question hour session, he said that India is insisting Pakistan to initiate negotiation concerning modification of the Indus Waters Treaty 1960. It is, therefore, she clarified that in the absence of receipt of information formally from India, violations concerning Treaty's permitted uses of waters of Western Rivers to India cannot be ascertained.
