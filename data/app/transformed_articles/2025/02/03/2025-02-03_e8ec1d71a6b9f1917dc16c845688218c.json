The campaign's progress was reviewed in a meeting chaired by Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad, which was attended by Additional Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners, health department officials, and representatives from the World Health Organization. The meeting focused on the campaign's arrangements, security of polio workers, and ways to address denial of cases. DC Islamabad has directed the authorities to make special arrangements for the security of polio workers, emphasizing the importance of their safety during the campaign. In an appeal to citizens, DC Islamabad urged cooperation with polio workers, stressing that their support is crucial in making the campaign a success.
