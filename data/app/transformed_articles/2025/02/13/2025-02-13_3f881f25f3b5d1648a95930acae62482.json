    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 13 (APP): Pakistan and Turkiye on Thursday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance cooperation in religious affairs and promote religious education between the two countries. The MoU was signed by Pakistan's Federal Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Chaudhry Salik Hussain, and Turkiye's Minister of Religious Affairs, Prof. Dr. Ali Erbas. Under the agreement, both nations will work together to facilitate Hajj and Umrah pilgrims by strengthening mutual coordination. They also pledged to formulate a joint strategy to counter extremism, terrorism, and sectarianism. To promote modern education, the exchange of scholars and students from religious seminaries (madaris) will be increased. Additionally, training courses and seminars will be organized to enhance the skills of Imams, preachers, and religious leaders, equipping them with scientific, religious, and cultural knowledge. Pakistan and Turkiye also agreed to expand cooperation with other Muslim countries to foster interfaith harmony, global peace, and address challenges facing the Islamic world. Efforts will be made to promote Islamic culture and the concept of moderation through collective initiatives with Muslim nations. Furthermore, both countries will collaborate on preserving and promoting Islamic heritage and culture through research and publications. This agreement marks a significant step in strengthening religious ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, fostering unity, and advancing mutual objectives in the realm of religious education and cultural exchange.",
