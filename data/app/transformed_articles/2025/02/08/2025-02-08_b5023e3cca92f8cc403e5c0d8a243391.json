    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 08 (APP): Convener of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) AJK chapter Ghulam Muhammad Safi on Saturday, hailed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the Army Chief for their clear stance over Kashmir issue on 'Feb 05' which conveyed a strong message to Kashmiris, India and the international community. He expressed these views during the press conference along with other APHC leaders, including Altaf Wani, Sheikh Abdul Mateen, Zahid Safi, Imtiaz Wani, Shamim Shawl and Secretary General APHC Pervaiz Shah at the National Press Club, said a press release. It was needed to encounter the propaganda of false information spread by India, Safi said. He urged Pakistani leadership to appoint the special ambassador for Kashmir to counter the Indian propaganda and also to support the Kashmir issue. He appreciated the Pakistani agency for foiling the Indian bid to sabotage the Kashmir Day programmes, adding that \"Kashmir Solidarity Day\" was observed with passion by Kashmiris living across the globe. On the occasion of 'Kashmir Day', APHC leaders were present at rallies, seminars and processions held across the country and expressed gratitude to the people for their unwavering support. He further added that Kashmiris should be given the right of a plebiscite to choose Pakistan or India. He emphasized that, contrary to Indian atrocities in Indian illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K), Pakistan always raised the Kashmir issue at all international forums like the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. He also paid tribute to those who were martyrs in their struggle for independence.",
