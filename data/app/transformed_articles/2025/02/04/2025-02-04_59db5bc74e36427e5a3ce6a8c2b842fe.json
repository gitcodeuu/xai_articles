Similarly, across Pakistan, metro stations, airports, and major roads were adorned with banners showcasing solidarity with Kashmiris. Educational institutions held debates and essay competitions to engage students in the Kashmir cause. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), massive rallies and demonstrations took place, including at the Line of Control (LoC). Calling on the UN and global human rights organizations to take notice of India's oppression, Muqam warned that regional and global peace is at risk due to India's aggressive policies. He urged Pakistani youth to use social media effectively to expose India's human rights abuses. Ghulam Muhammad Safi, reaffirmed Pakistan's steadfast support, condemning India's unilateral revocation of Kashmir's special status on August 5, 2019. He accused India of demographic engineering and a Hindutva-driven agenda aimed at altering the region's Muslim-majority character.
