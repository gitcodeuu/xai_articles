    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP):The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) has announced that the upgradation and extension of Dera Ghazi Khan Airport's runway is expected to be completed by December 2026, following the submission of the consultant's report. The update was shared during the monthly DG PAA E-Kacheri, held at the PAA Headquarters, Terminal-I, Karachi, and chaired by Deputy Director General (Works & Development) Mr. Sumair Saeed. Mr. Saeed informed participants that the DG Khan runway will be extended by 3,000 meters and widened to 45 meters to accommodate larger aircraft and enhance operational safety. He added that feasibility studies for establishing a new Sukkur International Airport are in progress, while upgrading the existing Sukkur Airport to international standards is also under consideration. Clarifying operational matters, the DyDG stated that DG Khan and Hyderabad Airports remain open for operations, and that route allocations depend on airlines' commercial viability assessments. During the session, participants raised various issues related to passenger services, including baggage handling, airline refunds, lost valuables, and staff behavior. Complaints regarding parking charges, unlicensed forklift operation, and passenger inconvenience at Peshawar, Islamabad, and Sialkot airports were also discussed. Mr. Saeed issued immediate instructions to relevant airport managers for on-the-spot redressal and directed that related issues be communicated to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for further action. He emphasized that passengers must be informed about compensation mechanisms for flight delays or cancellations to promote transparency and accountability. Addressing a query about Serene Air, the DyDG explained that the airline's Air Operator Certificate (AOC) was suspended by the regulator after it failed to maintain a single airworthy aircraft. On a gold theft complaint, the Additional Director Security informed that inquiries had been completed and advised the complainant to contact airport management to file an FIR for further investigation. Concluding the session, Mr. Saeed thanked participants, noting that public feedback is vital in improving airport operations and enhancing passenger services.",
