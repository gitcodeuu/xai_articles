    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP): The Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the Special Technology Zones Authority (STZA) have agreed to form a Joint Working Group (JWG) to expedite the establishment of a Special Technology Zone in Islamabad, marking a major step toward transforming the federal capital into a technopolis city. The decision was made during a high-level meeting jointly chaired by Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa, and Chairman STZA, Azfar Manzoor, at the CDA Headquarters on Wednesday. Under the proposed framework, STZA will act as the regulator, issuing licenses to high-tech firms, while CDA will serve as the development agency, responsible for the zone's physical planning and infrastructure. The newly formed Joint Working Group will evaluate multiple proposals, assess financial and operational models, and submit viable recommendations to the Federal Government for approval. Briefing participants, officials informed that the Special Technology Zone will include dedicated areas for technology innovation and high-tech production, designed to attract global entrepreneurs and leading firms. The zone is also expected to offer tax and duty incentives once cleared by the Federal Government. Speaking on the occasion, Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa reaffirmed that establishing the Special Technology Zone is the topmost priority of CDA, in partnership with STZA, to make Islamabad a regional technology hub. He emphasized that the project will promote innovation, job creation, and digital transformation, adding that CDA is preparing a financially sustainable and globally competitive model for the initiative. \"This collaboration with STZA will pave the way for Islamabad's evolution into a modern technopolis city,\" Randhawa said, reiterating CDA's commitment to utilize STZA's expertise to ensure the project's success after Federal Government approval. The meeting was attended by Member Planning and Design Dr. Khalid Hafiz, Executive Director STZA Aamir Saleemi, and other senior officers from both organizations.",
