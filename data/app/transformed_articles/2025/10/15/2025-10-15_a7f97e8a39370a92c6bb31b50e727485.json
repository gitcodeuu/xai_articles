    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday sought a clarification from the Accountability Court for not deciding the petition filed by the accused in the fake bank accounts case regarding the jurisdiction after the NAB amendments. Farooq H. Naek argued that the High Court has the authority to take contempt of court action against the trial court judge for violating the court order. The court also issued a notice to NAB on the petition and adjourned the hearing till November 3. A division bench comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Muhammad Asif heard the contempt of court petition filed by the accused Abdul Jabbar and Najam-uz-Zaman in the fake bank accounts case against the Accountability Court for not deciding the jurisdiction of the NAB despite the court order. Lawyer Farooq H. Naek appeared in the court on behalf of the petitioners and said that this court had ordered in September that the Accountability Court should pronounce the verdict within 15 days. The judge did not pronounce the verdict but instead set a date of one month. The court asked what you want? Tell me whether contempt of court action can be taken against the judge or departmental disciplinary action will be taken? Farooq H. Naek said that the order of the High Court was not followed, therefore action can be taken. This division bench can take contempt of court action against the judge of the trial court. He said that this case is also from Karachi and the accused are also from Karachi, the application has been under hearing for a year. This case should be sent to the Karachi court. After the NAB amendments, this case has no relevance here. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro said that we will seek a reply from the judge of the trial court regarding the non-delivery of the verdict. The court said that the judge of the accountability court should submit a reply as to why the verdict of the case has not been delivered yet despite the court order? After which the hearing was adjourned till November 3.",
