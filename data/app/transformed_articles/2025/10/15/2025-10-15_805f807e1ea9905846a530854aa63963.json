    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP):Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday strongly condemned the firing incident targeting an anti-polio team in Nowshera, which resulted in the martyrdom of police constable Maqsood, who was deployed for the security of the health workers. In a statement, Minister Naqvi paid rich tribute to the martyred constable, acknowledging his bravery and devotion to duty. \"Police constable Maqsood attained the great status of martyrdom while performing his duty,\" he said. The minister expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the bereaved family, assuring them that the sacrifices of the police and security personnel would never be forgotten. Terming the incident a cowardly act, the interior minister said that the attack on a team working for the safe and healthy future of Pakistan's children is utterly intolerable.
