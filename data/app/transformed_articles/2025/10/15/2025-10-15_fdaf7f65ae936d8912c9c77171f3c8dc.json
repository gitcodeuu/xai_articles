    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP): Chairman Senate Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, on Wednesday, said that fostering inclusivity, accessibility, and equal opportunities for persons with visual impairments is essential, saying that a caring and barrier-free society reflects the true essence of humanity. In his message on the occasion of White Cane Day, the Chairman said the white cane stands as a universal symbol of courage, mobility, and independence for visually impaired persons. He added that it is the collective responsibility of society and institutions to ensure that persons with disabilities are empowered to live with dignity and actively participate in all spheres of life. Gilani reaffirmed Parliament's commitment to safeguarding the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities through progressive legislation and effective oversight. He urged all segments of society to work together to create an environment that recognizes ability beyond disability and enables every individual to contribute meaningfully to national development.",
