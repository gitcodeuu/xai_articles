    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP):The 8th Director General's E-Kachehri of the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) was held at the PAA Headquarters, Karachi, under the chairmanship of Deputy Director General (Works & Development) Sumair Saeed. During the session, Sumair Saeed announced that the upgradation work at DG Khan Airport is expected to be completed by December 2026. The project includes extending the runway by 3,000 meters and widening it to 45 meters to accommodate larger aircraft. He further shared that the Authority is considering two options for Sukkur - either constructing a new international airport or upgrading the existing one to meet international standards. Responding to public queries, the Deputy DG (Planning & Development) clarified that DG Khan and Hyderabad airports are fully operational, though final decisions regarding flight operations lie with the airlines, which determine routes based on commercial viability. Sumair Saeed also emphasized the need to raise passenger awareness regarding their right to compensation in cases of flight delays or cancellations.",
