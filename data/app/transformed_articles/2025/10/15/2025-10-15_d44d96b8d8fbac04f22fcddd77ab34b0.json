    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP):A wave of green is sweeping across Pakistan's capital as indoor plants become the latest lifestyle and wellness trend among Islamabad residents. From high rise apartments in Blue Area to cozy homes in G-10 and F-11, people are increasingly turning their living spaces into mini urban jungles. The movement, fueled by social media inspiration, environmental consciousness, and the desire for calm, cleaner spaces, is transforming the city's aesthetic and mindset. What once seemed like a niche hobby is now a full-fledged lifestyle choice among young professionals, homemakers, and even students. Local nurseries have recorded a significant 40-50% surge in indoor plant sales over the past year. \"The most in-demand varieties are snake plants, peace lilies, spider plants, pothos, and rubber plants are known for purifying indoor air,\" said Muhammad Imran, owner of Green Garden Nursery in F-8 Markaz. \"Even compact species like succulents, jade plants, and cacti are a hit among young professionals who want something easy to maintain\" he told APP. At Islamabad's Sunday Bazaar, vendors echo similar trends, saying customers are now more informed and experimental. \"People know plant names and ask about lighting, watering schedules, and growth patterns,\" Sadia Khalid , a home gardener and influencer shared with APP. \"Monstera deliciosa, ZZ plants, and fiddle leaf figs are especially popular for their Instagram worthy look.\" Experts say the growing popularity of indoor plants is rooted in their many benefits. They improve air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and toxins, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance focus and productivity. Plants also increase humidity, which helps with dry skin and respiratory comfort during the city's cooler months. \"Having plants around creates a sense of calm and grounding,\" said Dr. Saima Rehman, an environmental psychologist at Quaid-i-Azam University,while talking to APP. \"It's like bringing a piece of nature into your routine a simple yet powerful antidote to urban stress.\" Residents are also finding practical uses for their indoor plants. Many are growing small kitchen friendly herbs like mint, corriander, basil, and lemongrass on sunny windowsills and balconies. \"It's refreshing to pick fresh mint leaves for tea or coriander for cooking,\" said Hina Malik, a homemaker from F-10. \"It not only saves money but also adds a natural touch to daily life.\" Environmentalists welcome the shift, noting that even small indoor gardens can contribute to sustainable living. \"Growing herbs indoors supports both mental wellness and eco-friendly habits,\" said Asad Mehmood, an environmental activist. \"It reduces reliance on packaged produce and encourages people to understand plant life cycles.\" Globally, the indoor greenery movement has also inspired writers and botanists to explore its deeper impact on human well-being. British biologist Sir David Attenborough once highlighted in his environmental essays that \"bringing nature into our daily spaces is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for balance and healing.\" Similarly,author and psychotherapist Sue Stuart-Smith in her internationally acclaimed book \"The Well-Gardened Mind\", explains how nurturing plants can mirror emotional growth, offering calm and purpose in an age of digital overwhelm. Renowned American botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer, in \"Braiding Sweetgrass\", also emphasizes that plants teach reciprocity \"the art of giving and receiving with respect\" reminding people that tending to green life within homes cultivates gratitude and mindfulness. However, the indoor plant craze is not without its drawbacks. Overwatering, lack of sunlight, and poor drainage often cause plants to die quickly, leading to frustration among beginners. Some species such as philodendrons, dieffenbachia, and peace lilies can also be toxic to pets and children if ingested. In smaller apartments, excessive humidity or damp soil can invite mold and insects, creating more problems than benefits. \"It's important to balance enthusiasm with knowledge,\" Dr. Saima added. \"Plants improve health when cared for properly, but neglected ones can do the opposite.\" Cafes, co-working spaces, and boutique stores in the capital are now designing interiors around natural aesthetics featuring plant walls, hanging vines, and bamboo corners. Interior designer Ayesha Rauf said, \"What started as decor is now part of urban culture. Islamabad is slowly becoming a city that breathes indoors.\" From nurseries to Instagram feeds, Islamabad's love affair with indoor plants continues to thrive. With the right mix of care and creativity, residents are turning concrete spaces into living sanctuaries and even mini kitchen gardens one green pot at a time.",
