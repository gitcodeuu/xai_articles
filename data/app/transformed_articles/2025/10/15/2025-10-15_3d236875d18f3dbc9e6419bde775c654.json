    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP): Chairman Senate Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani on Wednesday strongly condemned the attack carried out by Afghan Taliban forces on Pakistani territory along the Pak-Afghan border. In a statement, he said targeting civilian populations by Afghan forces were highly regrettable and a blatant violation of international norms and principles. The Chairman Senate lauded the Pakistan Army and security forces for their timely and effective response, saying they demonstrated exceptional professionalism, determination, and bravery in thwarting the enemy's malicious designs. He reaffirmed that there would be no compromise on Pakistan's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national dignity, adding that the armed forces had once again lived up to the nation's expectations by setting a new example of courage and patriotism. Gilani said the Parliament and the entire nation stood shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces and were ready to make every sacrifice for the defence of the motherland. He said any act of aggression from Afghanistan posed a serious threat to regional peace. \"Pakistan desires peace, but it will safeguard its borders at all costs,\" he asserted. Rejecting the baseless allegations and false propaganda emanating from Afghanistan, the Chairman Senate said the Pakistan Army remained ever vigilant and fully prepared to defend the country's frontiers.",
