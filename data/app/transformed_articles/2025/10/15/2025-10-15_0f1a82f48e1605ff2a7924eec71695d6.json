    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP): The Standing Committee on Power Division, chaired by MNA Muhammad Idrees, met at Parliament House on Wednesday to review progress on ongoing power projects, policy reforms, and issues related to load-shedding and electrification delays across various regions of the country. The Committee took up the \"Multi-Vendor Electricity Distribution Bill, 2025,\" moved by Ms. Shahida Rehmani, MNA. Ms. Rehmani briefed the Committee that the Bill sought to end Karachi's dependence on a single electricity distributor by introducing multiple vendors to encourage competition, enhance efficiency, and improve consumer choice, said a press release. The Ministry informed that similar provisions already existed under the NEPRA Act, which provided for a multi-buyer market through the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM). However, the Committee deferred the Bill till February, 2026 for further consideration and recommendation. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Hazara Electric Supply Company (HAZECO), briefed the Committee on the status of ongoing electrification projects and future plans. He informed that under the Dasu Hydropower Project, development works worth Rs. 132.17 million had been approved, of which 48 projects had been completed while 26 remained pending or disputed. Under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Program, 85 electrification projects had been completed, and 5 were in progress with an allocation of Rs. 148.86 million. The Committee directed the CEO, HAZECO, to coordinate with the concerned MNA of Constituency NA-12 (Kohistan) to resolve the disputed projects and take measures to reduce load-shedding in District Kohistan, with a comprehensive report to be submitted in the next meeting. The CEO, Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO), briefed the Committee on the issue of discriminatory load-shedding raised by Syed Hussain Tariq, MNA. Mr. Tariq acknowledged recent improvements, ongoing accountability measures, and approval of an investment plan to restructure HESCO, under which 78 feeders would be exempted from load-shedding this year. The Committee directed the Secretary, Power Division, to hold a meeting with the MNA to address the replacement of outdated wires and curb electricity theft, with a progress report to be submitted to the Committee. The CEO, Sukkur Electric Supply Company (SEPCO), briefed the Committee on pending electrification schemes initiated in 2021 by Mr. Muhammad Shaharyar Khan Mahar, Ex-MPA, and Mr. Nauman Islam Shaikh, MNA. Mr. Shaikh informed that several projects launched under federal development programs had remained incomplete due to administrative delays. While some had reached up to 90% completion, others had stalled, including one that was 99% complete but halted due to changes in SEPCO's management and board. The prolonged delay, he added, had adversely affected local farmers. The Committee was informed that the previous Board of SEPCO had completed its tenure and a new one was being reconstituted. The Committee decided that a detailed meeting to be convened in Power Division, Islamabad to discuss the issues of electricity of districts working under Sukkur Electric Supply Company for further consideration and recommendation. The Committee expressed concern over the absence of the CEO, GENCO, from the meeting and discussed the non-implementation of transfer and posting policies for employees of GENCO, Jamshoro, in accordance with their domicile, education, and scale. The Committee directed the Secretary, Power Division, to convene a meeting in his office with Syed Waseem Hussain, MNA, and the CEO, GENCO, to resolve the matter and report back to the Committee. A Member highlighted that staff shortages were affecting billing efficiency and power recovery, causing hardships to honest consumers who suffered from prolonged outages due to systemic defaults. The Ministry assured that an ongoing recruitment drive and outsourcing initiatives would help address these constraints. It was further informed that circular debt had been effectively capped for the past three to four years and that structural reforms were being pursued for its long-term elimination. The Committee also discussed the increasing shift toward solar energy amid frequent load-shedding. Members observed that while many consumers had installed solar systems under the net-metering policy, procedural delays continued to discourage new applicants. The Ministry clarified that while the government supported the expansion of solar energy, maintaining grid stability alongside renewable integration was essential. The meeting was attended by Raja Qamar ul Islam, Chaudhary Naseer Ahmed Abbas, Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, Rana Muhammad Hayat Khan, Mr. Muhammad Shaharyar Khan Mahar, Mr. Khurshid Ahmed Junejo, Mr. Nauman Islam Shaikh, Syed Waseem Hussain, Syed Abrar Ali Shah, and Mr. Sanjay Perwani, MNAs. Senior officers from the Power Division, Ministry of Law and Justice, and representatives from NEPRA, LESCO, IESCO, PPMC, PESCO, HAZECO, HESCO, SEPCO, PPML, and GHCL also attended.",
