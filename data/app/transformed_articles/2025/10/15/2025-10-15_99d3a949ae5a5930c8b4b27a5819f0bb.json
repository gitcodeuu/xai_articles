    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP): President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday emphasised the need to expand cooperation with Romania in trade, investment, culture, and people-to-people exchanges. He was talking to Pakistan's Ambassador-designate to Romania, Ilyas Mehmood Nizami who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr. The president congratulated Mr Nizami on his appointment and said Romania is an important partner in Central and Eastern Europe, with this year marking 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. He advised the ambassador-designate to prioritise economic diplomacy, enhance bilateral trade, and explore opportunities in renewable energy, technology, and agriculture. The president also stressed effective follow-up on the 2025 MoU on Trade and Economic Cooperation with the Bucharest Chamber of Commerce and the importance of upcoming business delegations from Pakistan. He asked for greater engagement with the Pakistani diaspora and promotion of Pakistan's art and culture to mark the milestone of 60 years of relations.",
