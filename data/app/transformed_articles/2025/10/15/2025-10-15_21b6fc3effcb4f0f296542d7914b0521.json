    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP):The Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan, in collaboration with academia, industry partners, and key public sector stakeholders including PSEB, P@SHA, and the Ministry of IT & Telecom (MoITT), successfully convened the National Curriculum Review Committee (NCRC) to standardize and modernize the degree programmes in the discipline of Computer Science at the tertiary level. The five-day meeting was held at the Institute of Business Management (IoBM), Karachi brought together leading universities, and industry experts to review, align, and finalize an industry-driven, globally benchmarked Computer Science curriculum. The activity was sponsored by the EU TVET Sector Support Program - British Council, said a press release on Wednesday. The revised curriculum for the Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science features several key enhancements designed to produce graduates with highly specialized, market-ready skills. The curriculum introduces a Comprehensive Core and Elective Framework offering up to 14 specializations. These specializations include high-demand fields such as Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science, Cyber Security, Information Technology (IT), Computer Engineering, Computer Games Development, Multimedia and Animation, Robotics, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Internet of Things (IoT), Network Infrastructure & Cloud Computing, Quantum Computing, and Health Informatics. Universities have the flexibility to introduce additional relevant specializations within this approved framework. A new Professional Certification Component has been integrated to strengthen academia-industry linkages and ensure that graduates possess immediately market-relevant skills. Furthermore, the curriculum emphasizes Practical Integration through detailed guidelines for the effective implementation of both Final Year Projects and Field Experience components. This entire revision is in Alignment with the HEC's Undergraduate Education Policy 2023, placing a strong focus on general education, interdisciplinary learning, and demonstrable applied competence. The Committee also endorsed the Associate Degree in Computing as a practical, skill-based qualification designed to prepare early-career professionals for the IT industry, with a progression pathway enabling graduates to join the BS Computer Science program through a bridge semester. The revised curriculum has been notified on October 14, 2025 for implementation by Higher Education Institutes (HEI). This collaborative milestone reflects HEC's commitment to producing industry-ready computing graduates and strengthening Pakistan's digital education ecosystem.",
