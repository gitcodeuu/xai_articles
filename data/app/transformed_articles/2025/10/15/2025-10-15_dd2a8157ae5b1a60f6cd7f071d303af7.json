    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP): The third day of anti-polio campaign in Islamabad concluded on Wednesday with health teams administering vaccination drops to 289,128 children, according to official data. The drive aimed to immunize a total of 461,125 children across the federal capital. Under the supervision of Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon, a review meeting was held to assess the progress of the ongoing vaccination campaign. Officials from health and district departments presented a detailed briefing on the campaign's performance during the first three days. According to the briefing, health teams have so far vaccinated 289,128 children under the ongoing polio eradication drive. The target for the campaign is 461,125 children across urban and rural areas of Islamabad. The report also noted that a total of 598 refusal cases were recorded during the campaign. Out of these, 416 cases have been resolved through awareness efforts and community engagement by health and field teams. Officials said the remaining refusal cases are being addressed with the help of local leaders and volunteers to ensure every child receives the vaccine. DC Islamabad directed all administrative officers to remain present in the field to ensure effective monitoring of the campaign. He emphasized that the eradication of polio requires strong coordination between government institutions and the public. \"Polio eradication is only possible through joint efforts of the administration and the community,\" DC Memon said. He instructed teams to strengthen outreach strategies, particularly in areas where refusal cases persist. The Deputy Commissioner appreciated the efforts of health workers, supervisors, and volunteers engaged in door-to-door vaccination drives. He said that their field presence plays a crucial role in identifying missed children and persuading hesitant families to cooperate. DC Memon further stressed that all departments should ensure real-time reporting from the field and maintain coordination with the health office to address challenges promptly. He directed officials to focus on awareness campaigns and community meetings to increase acceptance of the vaccine among parents. Highlighting the importance of parental responsibility, the Deputy Commissioner urged all parents to ensure their children receive the polio drops during the campaign. \"Every child must be vaccinated to protect our future generations from polio,\" he added. The district administration reiterated its commitment to eliminating polio from the federal capital and said that efforts will continue until every child is covered.",
