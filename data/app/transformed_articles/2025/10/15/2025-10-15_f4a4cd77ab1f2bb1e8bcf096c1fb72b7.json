The minister also paid tribute to the Pakistan Army for the successful Operation 'Bunyan-ul-Marsoos' against Indian aggression, calling it \"a moment of national pride and military excellence.\" He also lauded Dr. Zahid Latif's scholarly contribution toward understanding Pakistan's regional policy and security challenges.
