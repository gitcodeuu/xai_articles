    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, October 15 (APP):The Country Coordinator of the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA), Saliha Tuna reaffirmed the commitment to empowering rural women and promoting sustainable development as the world observed the International Day of Rural Women on Wednesday. In an exclusive talk with APP on this occasion, she underscored the pivotal role of rural women in sustaining communities nurturing the land, ensuring food security, and driving local development through their resilience and dedication. \"Across the world, rural women are the backbone of sustainable communities feeding families, cultivating hope, and shaping the future,\" Saliha said, highlighting its ongoing agricultural and livelihood programs designed to uplift women as active partners in social and economic progress. As part of its broader vision for inclusive growth, she informed that TIKA is also advancing initiatives that directly improve access to essential resources such as clean water and education. In Islamabad, Saliha said TIKA is installing a solar-powered Ultra Filtration Water Plant at the Islamabad Model School for Girls (NIH Colony), a project set to provide safe drinking water to more than 1,200 students. She said a TIKA team recently visited the school to assess the progress of the installation, interact with students, and learn about their educational aspirations. The project, expected to be completed within six weeks, will improve health conditions and enhance the learning environment for young girls, she added. \"Clean water and education are the foundations of sustainable development,\" the TIKA country coordinator said adding, \"By investing in both, we are investing in a healthier, more equitable future.\" Saliha remarked that TIKA's initiatives continue to reflect Turkiye's commitment to human-centered development, fostering resilience and opportunity for communities particularly women and youth across Pakistan and beyond.",
