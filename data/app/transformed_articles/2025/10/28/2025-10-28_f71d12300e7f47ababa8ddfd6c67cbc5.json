    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 01 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar revealed on Saturday that Pakistani fisherman Ejaz Mallah was arrested by local intelligence agencies on charges of espionage, after allegedly being detained and coerced by the Indian coast guard to work for India's intelligence service. At a joint press conference with Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, the minister accused India of orchestrating a misinformation campaign against Pakistan in the aftermath of its failed Operation Sindoor. Tarar stated that Pakistani intelligence agencies had placed Ejaz Mallah under surveillance due to suspicious activities and subsequently arrested him. He claimed this arrest provided clear evidence of India's alleged attempts to malign Pakistan through covert and deceptive tactics. \"After its humiliating failure in Operation Sindoor, India has resorted to underhanded measures to damage Pakistan's reputation,\" Tarar asserted, emphasizing the need for vigilance against foreign propaganda efforts. Tarar said this was another malicious attempt by India, similar to the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav. He emphasized that Pakistan's security agencies are on high alert and fully prepared to foil any conspiracy. \"The world is well aware of India's malicious intentions and false narrative,\" Tarar asserted, adding that Pakistan has successfully thwarted India's conspiracy and exposed its designs before the world. Tarar was of the opinion that the Modi government orchestrates such theatrics ahead of every election. India was preparing another similar ploy, but Ejaz Mallah was apprehended red-handed in a meticulously planned operation. The Information Minister stated that India had arrested a fisherman named Ejaz Mallah, who routinely fished in the open sea. He alleged that Mallah was detained by the Indian Coast Guard and later repatriated to Pakistan, having been assigned specific tasks by Indian authorities. The Indian intelligence agencies coerced Mallah and exploited him for activities against Pakistan. Tarar stated that Mallah, had previously been detained by Indian authorities and relocated to an undisclosed location before being deployed for espionage activities. He accused India of being frustrated by Pakistan's recent diplomatic achievements and national progress. Following the reported failure of Operation Sindoor. Mallah had been instructed by Indian authorities to acquire uniforms of the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Rangers. Pakistani intelligence agencies began closely monitoring Mallah after he attempted to procure the military attire. Minister Tarar stated that Ejaz Mallah confessed to all charges following his arrest. Tarar also played Mallah's recorded confessional statement, in which Mallah recounted that he and others were fishing when they were detained by Indian authorities. According to Mallah, the Indian side instructed him to bring military uniforms along with Zong SIM cards, Pakistani cigarettes, receipts and currency. He claimed that after complying, the Indian intelligence agency released him. Mallah further revealed that he had sent photographs of the intelligence officer, and was subsequently arrested by a Pakistani agency upon returning to sea.",
