    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 28 (APP):In a heartwarming celebration of brotherhood that transcends borders, language and time, the Pak-Turk Friendship Week celebrations held at Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) brought together two nations bound by shared faith, history, and affection. Organized by the Prime Minister's Youth Programme in collaboration with the Yunus Emre Institute and the PNCA, the event served as a vibrant tribute to the enduring friendship and cultural harmony between Pakistan and Turkey -a relationship rooted in trust, respect, and an unbroken legacy of solidarity. The week-long celebration featured enthralling cultural performances, including traditional music, folk dances, and art displays that highlighted the shared heritage and artistic diversity of both nations. The beautifully adorned stage bore the logos of the collaborating organizations- the Prime Minister's Youth Programme, Yunus Emre Institute, and PNCA-along with portraits of the leaders of Pakistan and Turkey, symbolizing the deep-rooted partnership between the two brotherly countries. Addressing the gathering, Turkish Ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Irfan Neziroglu, said it was a privilege to commemorate the 102nd anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey alongside the people of Pakistan. He expressed deep gratitude to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, for his gracious support and participation in the celebrations. Dr. Nezirohlu emphasized that the Pakistan-Turkey relationship is founded on trust, brotherhood, and shared values that have remained steadfast through time. Reflecting on history, the Ambassador recalled the solidarity shown by the people of the Subcontinent during the First World War, particularly the moral and financial support extended to the Ottoman Empire by figures such as Allama Muhammad Iqbal- a gesture, he noted, that continues to be remembered with immense gratitude by the Turkish nation. Speaking on the occasion, Huzaifa Rehman, Minister of State / Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, said it was a matter of great pride to celebrate the 102nd Republic Day of Turkey with the Turkish brethren. He noted that Turkey's journey of resilience, reform, and progress stands as an inspiration for the entire Muslim world. The state minister remarked that Pakistan and Turkey share a unique bond that transcends diplomatic relations- a bond of hearts, strengthened through faith, culture, and a shared vision for peace and prosperity. He extended warm felicitations to the leadership and people of Turkey, reaffirming Pakistan's commitment to deepening collaboration in areas of youth development, education, and culture. The event concluded with a renewed pledge from both sides to further strengthen bilateral ties and cooperation in diverse fields. Participants agreed that the Pak-Turk friendship-rooted in mutual respect, shared heritage, and unwavering solidarity-will continue to grow and serve as a model of unity and partnership for generations to come.",
