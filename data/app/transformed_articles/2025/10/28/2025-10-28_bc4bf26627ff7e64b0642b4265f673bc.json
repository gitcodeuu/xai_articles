He highlighted that Pakistani youth continue to raise the national flag high across the world through outstanding performances in cricket, squash, hockey, and tennis. Addressing the young athletes, Sayedaal Khan Nasir said, \"You are not just representatives of your sport - you are the ambassadors of Pakistan's identity and future.
