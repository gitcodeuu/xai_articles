    "article_body": "LAHORE, Oct 28 (APP):In line with the \"Suthra Punjab\" vision of Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the District Administration Lahore has intensified its ongoing anti-encroachment drive across the city, successfully removing 396 encroachments from major roads, markets, and commercial areas. Deputy Commissioner Lahore Syed Musa Raza supervised the large-scale operations being carried out under the leadership of Metropolitan Officer (Regulation) Kashif Jaleel, with active participation of the MCL Regulation Squad. During the campaign, 1,527 banners, flexes, and other visual pollution materials were also removed to enhance the city's cleanliness and aesthetic appeal. Speaking about the campaign, the DC Lahore said the purpose of these operations is to restore public spaces, improve traffic flow, and ensure convenience for citizens. He directed all Assistant Commissioners to expedite actions against encroachment hotspots within their respective areas, adding that no obstruction to traffic flow will be tolerated. He further emphasized that all operations are being conducted in a transparent and organized manner, with the aim of transforming Lahore into a clean, organized, and encroachment-free city. Citizens have been urged to register complaints through the control room (0307-0002345) or the district administration's official social media platforms. DC Syed Musa Raza said that law will be enforced strictly and uniformly, and no individual or group will be allowed to act above it. He added that the campaign will continue until every illegal encroachment is removed, helping to revive Lahore's historic beauty and urban charm.",
