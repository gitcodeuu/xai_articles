    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 8 (APP):The house and library committee of the National Assembly (NA) announced that they would visit the construction site of the new Parliament lodges this month to review the ongoing works, including the parking sheds and marbling of the main lobby areas, noting that construction of these lodges, delayed for nearly 18 years, was progressing at full pace with the support of the Speaker of the National Assembly. The announcement was made during the 7th meeting of the House and Library Committee of the National Assembly (NA), which was held on Wednesday at the Parliament House under the chairmanship of Deputy Speaker NA Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah. The meeting was also attended by Members National Assembly (MNA) Nabil Gabol, Ijaz Hussain Jakhrani, Muhammad Moin Aamer Pirzada, Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and officials of the Islamabad police. The agenda of the meeting included the confirmation of the minutes of the previous meeting held on 2nd September 2025 and a comprehensive review of the implementation status of the earlier recommendations. A subcommittee led by Mr Ijaz Jakhrani also briefed the Committee on its recent visit to review the construction progress of the new Lodges project, highlighting the ongoing improvements and remaining bottlenecks. The Committee examined progress reports regarding the construction of additional Family Suites and Servant Quarters, re-tendering of tuck shops, beauty parlour, barber shop, tailor shop, laundry shop, cable TV office, and cafeteria at Parliament Lodges and the Government Hostel. Chairman CDA briefed the Committee that model rooms are being prepared and the main lobby and public areas will be marble-finished with proper thickness and quality. He further informed that the design and sample for the new parking sheds have been finalized in line with the approved master plan, ensuring integration between the existing and new structures. The Deputy Speaker raised concerns about parking congestion at Parliament Lodges, observing that even taxis often occupy the parking lots. Chairman CDA informed that a total of 615 parking spaces will be created in the new design, and an additional 200 in the old Servant Quarters area, to permanently resolve the issue. Deputy Speaker Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah also directed the issuance of vehicle stickers for Members of Parliament and called for better management and coordination between CDA, Police, and Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) to ensure smooth parking and movement. The Committee decided to invite the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) to the next meeting to address traffic and security management comprehensively. Chairman CDA briefed the Committee that the summary for the allocation of additional funds for renovation of old lodges, initiated with the support of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, is currently under process at the Ministry of Interior. The Deputy Speaker instructed that renovation of 40-45 old lodges be undertaken on priority and that a detailed list be submitted to the Committee. The Committee also discussed the maintenance of gym facilities at Parliament Lodges. Members noted that gym equipment was out of order and stressed the need to repair existing machines instead of procuring new ones. The CDA Chairman informed that the staff would be recruited regularly and that all gym equipment would be made functional promptly. The issues of non-functional elevators, CCTV cameras, and electric meters at the Servant Quarters were also taken up. The CDA informed the Committee that installation of two new lifts, along with the repair and maintenance of existing elevators at the Parliament Lodges, is currently underway. CDA is further committed to rendering all CCTV systems operational within three months and coordinating with WAPDA for expediting meter transfers and demand notices. The Deputy Speaker directed CDA to ensure the timely completion of all works within four months, with proper monitoring and submission of progress reports at each meeting. The Committee emphasized the need for market-oriented and branded outlets while re-entering shops at Parliament Lodges to ensure improved quality and service. CDA assured that Terms of Reference (TORs) for the re-tendering process will be completed by 21st October 2025. The meeting concluded with a reaffirmation of the Committee's resolve to improve living and working facilities for Parliamentarians and staff, ensuring that all projects are completed transparently and in accordance with prescribed timelines.",
