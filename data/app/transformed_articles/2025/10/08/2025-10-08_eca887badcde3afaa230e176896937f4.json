    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 8 (APP):Prime Minister's Coordinator on Information, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, on Wednesday, focused on resilience, unity and faith on National Resilience Day, calling these factors the true strength of Pakistan, which had made the nation stronger in every calamity. In his message on National Resilience Day, which is being marked on October 08, Ikhtiar Wali Khan said the day reminds us of the moment when the earth shook, but the resolve of the Pakistani nation stood firm. \"The 2005 earthquake shook the mountains and valleys of KP, especially Balakot, yet the spirit of the people shone brightly and was written into history in golden words,\" he said. The calamity, while leaving behind deep sorrows, also gave birth to a nation that refuses to bow before adversity, he said. He said, \"As we mark the 20th anniversary of that catastrophic event, we salute the martyrs, the orphans, the brave volunteers and those resilient hands that searched for hope amidst the ruins.\" Ikhtiar Wali said the people of KP are symbols of endurance and dignity-those who turned wounds into healing, rebuilt homes from the rubble and lit the lamps of hope amid despair. He said that even today, when floods, earthquakes, or other trials strike, the Pakistani nation rises again with the same unwavering spirit. \"This homeland is our mother-in its soil, we have found the courage to live, to struggle and to triumph,\" he said. Reaffirming his commitment, Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that the new generation must be taught that resilience, unity and faith are the pillars on which Pakistan will always stand. Concluding his message, he prayed that Allah Almighty protect Pakistan from every calamity and grant the strength to build a nation that emerges even stronger after every test.",
