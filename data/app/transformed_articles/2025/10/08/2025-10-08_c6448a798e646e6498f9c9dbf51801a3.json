    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 08 (APP):The Capital Development Authority (CDA), meeting chaired by Muhammad Ali Randhawa, has taken a major step toward modernizing Islamabad's water infrastructure by approving the launch of a Water Metering Project. The decision, made at a high-level meeting of the Islamabad Water Agency, is aimed at improving efficiency, reducing water wastage, and ensuring fair billing for residents. The meeting was attended by CDA Member Planning and Design Dr. Khalid Hafiz, DG Islamabad Water, DG Planning and Development, representatives from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Pakistan Telecommunications Infrastructure Authority (PTIA). Chairman Randhawa said the project will involve engaging specialist consultants to design and implement an advanced metering system. \"The Water Metering Project is a landmark decision for Islamabad. It will modernize water management, improve accountability, and help conserve this precious resource,\" he said. The meeting also explored other initiatives, including converting all tube wells and electrical installations to solar energy systems, installing energy-efficient pumps, and upgrading sewerage networks. However, the metering system was highlighted as a priority for immediate action. \"Our aim is to adopt modern and sustainable solutions to ensure uninterrupted, clean, and safe water for the citizens of Islamabad. This project is a critical part of that vision,\" Chairman Randhawa added. The Water Metering Project is expected to reduce line losses, prevent water wastage, and provide transparent billing, setting a benchmark for efficient urban water management in Pakistan. Chairman Randhawa emphasized: \"Water is not only a basic need but also essential for the survival of every sector. We must value every drop to avoid future scarcity.\"",
