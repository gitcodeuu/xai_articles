    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 08 (APP): The Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology (NIAB), a premier research institution of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), inaugurated the IAEA Regional Training Course (RTC) on \"Advanced Mutation Breeding Techniques for the Improvement of Nutritional Quality.\" Organized under the framework of the IAEA Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA), the course brings together participants from 14 member states of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The event underscores Pakistan's growing leadership in promoting the peaceful applications of nuclear science for sustainable agriculture and food security. The inauguration ceremony was attended by IAEA experts and national and international scientists, who emphasized the importance of advanced nuclear and mutation breeding technologies for improving the nutritional quality of food crops and strengthening regional research collaboration. Addressing the ceremony as chief guest, Dr Samina Iqbal, Officiating Director of the National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE), lauded NIAB and PAEC's contribution to agricultural research through nuclear techniques. \"Pakistan's sustained commitment to agricultural innovation through nuclear science has not only enhanced national food security but also positioned our institutions as centers of excellence within the region,\" she remarked. Earlier, Dr. Muhammad Akhtar, Officiating Director of NIAB, welcomed the participants and expressed hope that the course would be fruitful in sharing valuable knowledge and adopting best agricultural practices. \"This training course reflects our shared determination, from commitment to execution, in advancing the IAEA's vision of peaceful nuclear cooperation,\" he said. Speaking on the occasion, Prof Dr M Kashif Riaz Khan, Head of the Plant Breeding and Genetics Division at NIAB, said: \"Safe use of nuclear techniques is indispensable, and by applying these techniques, NIAB has developed 65 crop varieties that are significantly contributing to the progress of the agriculture sector in the country.\" Prof Dr Nasya Tomlekova, an IAEA expert from Bulgaria, speaking on behalf of the visiting delegation, commended Pakistan's consistent role in supporting regional capacity building. She noted that collaboration between the IAEA and PAEC institutions like NIAB continues to set a valuable example for the entire Asia-Pacific region, adding that such initiatives accelerate scientific exchange, enhance regional capabilities, and contribute to improved nutrition and livelihoods across IAEA member states. The training course, continuing through October 17, features interactive sessions, laboratory demonstrations, and expert-led field visits, focusing on strengthening regional expertise in mutation breeding and crop improvement. It is worth mentioning that NIAB is an IAEA Collaborating Centre for Agriculture, recognized for its outstanding contributions to nuclear applications in crop improvement, soil management, and plant nutrition. The institute is also one of the four major agricultural research centers of PAEC, alongside the National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE), Faisalabad, the Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Peshawar, and the Nuclear Institute of Agriculture (NIA), Tandojam. Collectively, these centers have developed 164 high-yielding and climate-resilient crop varieties, of which 90 remain in active cultivation, marking a lasting contribution to Pakistan's agricultural sustainability and food security. Pakistan's continued partnership with the IAEA in agricultural sciences reflects its unwavering commitment to harnessing nuclear technology for peace, prosperity, and regional progress. Through PAEC's agricultural research centers, the country stands at the forefront of innovation, translating scientific knowledge into tangible benefits for farmers, consumers, and the wider global community.",
