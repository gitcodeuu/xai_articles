    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 8 (APP):The Commonwealth Youth Programme has officially opened nominations for the 2026 Commonwealth Youth Awards, announcing the launch of a new global honour, the Patsy Robertson Award for Outstanding Communications Skills in Advancing Community Development and Peace. The award, launched in partnership with the Commonwealth Association, aims to recognise young journalists, writers, broadcasters, and digital media creators from across the 56 Commonwealth nations who are using media and storytelling to promote peace, democracy, and inclusive societies. The initiative was announced to encourage youth participation in communication for development and to celebrate young voices shaping positive narratives for a fair and connected world. The new award pays tribute to the late Patsy Robertson, former Director of Communications at the Commonwealth Secretariat and founding Chair of the Commonwealth Association. Robertson was celebrated for her fearless advocacy for press freedom, gender equality, and ethical journalism, and her lifelong commitment to using communication as a force for peace and justice. The introduction of this category reflects the Commonwealth's growing emphasis on the power of media to strengthen democratic values and bridge divides in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Under this new category, young communicators aged 15 to 29 will be recognised for their exceptional contributions to community development through journalism, creative storytelling, and digital content. Eligible candidates must be citizens of a Commonwealth country and have been involved in communication or development-related work for at least 12 months, either professionally or voluntarily. Applicants may include reporters, editors, photojournalists, bloggers, podcasters, commentators, broadcasters, or social media activists, whose work demonstrates innovation, impact, and integrity. To qualify, applicants must submit samples of their published or broadcast work, letters of reference, and a statement explaining how their projects contribute to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 which focuses on promoting peace, justice, and strong institutions. The judging panel will evaluate entries based on impact, creativity, sustainability, credibility, and contribution to positive social change. The winner of the Patsy Robertson Award will receive a 1,000 cash prize, a trophy, and a certificate, and will be formally honoured during Commonwealth Week in March 2026. The award's launch underscores the Commonwealth's ongoing commitment to empowering young people as change agents who use communication to challenge misinformation, advocate for truth, and foster peace across communities. This new recognition forms part of the Commonwealth Youth Awards for Excellence in Development Work, a long-standing initiative that celebrates youth-led efforts advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each year, 20 Regional Finalists are selected from across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Pacific , each receiving 1,000, a trophy, and a certificate. From these, five Regional Winners are chosen, each earning an additional 2,000, while one exceptional individual is named the Pan-Commonwealth Winner and Commonwealth Young Person of the Year, receiving a total of 5,000. The Commonwealth Youth Awards not only honour the achievements of young people but also highlight their leadership in shaping fair, democratic, and sustainable societies. By including this new category for communicators, the Commonwealth is recognising the vital role that free and responsible media plays in development and democracy particularly at a time when young voices are driving social change through innovative storytelling and digital advocacy. Nominations for all award categories, including the Patsy Robertson Award, are now open and will close at 23:59 BST (UK time) on 17 October 2025. Individuals can nominate themselves or be nominated by someone familiar with their work.
