    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 8 (APP):The Vice Chancellor of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), Dr Nasir Mahmood, on Wednesday emphasized that mental health should be given the same importance as physical health, as a peaceful mind nurtures creativity and constructive abilities. AIOU organized an important seminar on the theme \"Mental Health and Well-being\" in connection with World Mental Health Day, which is going to be observed on Oct 10. Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr Nasir Mahmood graced the event as the chief guest, while Prof. Dr Abdul Aziz Sahir, Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, presided over the session. A large number of students, faculty members, and principal officers attended the event, said a press release. In his address, Prof. Dr Nasir Mahmood said Islam teaches us to adopt balance, moderation and a positive way of thinking. If we make these guiding principles part of our daily lives, we can not only achieve individual peace of mind but also contribute to building a balanced and healthy society. He further emphasized He also stressed that universities should provide platforms where students could seek guidance regarding their intellectual, emotional and social well-being. Such activities not only enhance awareness but also encourage the younger generation to adopt a positive lifestyle. Addressing the participants, Professor Dr Abdul Aziz Sahir said that those who followed the teachings of the Prophet always attained true happiness and success. The more we distance ourselves from materialistic values, the closer we move to nature and mental balance; conversely, attachment to materialism increases difficulties and restlessness in life.",
