    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 08 (APP):For the first time in history, the Department of Culture and Tourism, Government of Balochistan, is set to bring the province's vibrant cultural identity, breathtaking landscapes, and untapped tourism potential to the heart of Pakistan. The Balochistan Grand Tourism Festival 2025, to be held from October 10-12 at the National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa), promises a dynamic celebration of Balochistan's spirit: colorful, resilient, and deeply rooted in heritage. Director Culture and Tourism Quetta, Dawood Tareen, said the festival marks a new chapter in promoting Balochistan's image at the national level. \"For decades, the narrative around Balochistan has been overshadowed by challenges,\" he said. \"Now it's time to present the province's real face-one that reflects culture, beauty, creativity, and opportunity.\" The event, organized under the vision of Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Tourism and Law Mir Zarain Khan Magsi, seeks to build cultural bridges between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan, while attracting global attention to its tourism and investment potential. \"This initiative is not just about tourism,\" Tareen emphasized. \"It's about cultural diplomacy-showing the world that Balochistan is an integral part of Pakistan's diversity and a symbol of hospitality, art, and peace.\" The three-day festival will transform Lok Virsa into a lively hub of folk music, crafts, tourism exhibitions, and traditional cuisine, showcasing the province's cultural, eco, coastal, adventure, and archaeological tourism. Visitors will also enjoy performances of timeless Balochi folk tales, including Hani and Sheh Mureed, and poetry by Mast Tawakali, blending storytelling, music, and theatre to capture the soul of Baloch culture. Adding intellectual depth to the festivities, a series of high-level panel discussions will bring together policymakers, experts, and entrepreneurs to chart the future of Balochistan's tourism and economy. On October 10, the session titled \"Tapping the Tourism Potential of Balochistan\" will feature Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Ahmed Bugti, Parliamentary Secretary Mir Zarain Magsi, Secretary Culture Shakeel Qadir Khan, and Prof. Dr. Zainab Bibi, exploring strategies for sustainable tourism growth. The following day's session, \"Blue Economy of Balochistan\", will focus on harnessing the province's vast coastal and marine resources, with key insights from Lieutenant General Hassan Azhar Hayat, Dr. Zia ur Rehman, and Dr. Hafeez Jamali, among others. The final day will spotlight \"Investment Opportunities in Balochistan\", moderated by Faria Farooq and featuring Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, Prime Minister's Tourism Coordinator Yasir Ilyas Khan, and Chenggaiz Hussain Khan, Chairman Balochistan Council on Foreign Relations while underscoring Balochistan's growing role in national trade and development. Equally enticing will be the culinary delights, offering traditional Balochi dishes from aromatic Sajji and Kaak bread to Turbat's dates alongside folk performances featuring the dambura and suroz, instruments that carry the rhythms of desert and sea. Diplomats, media, students, and art enthusiasts are expected to attend the festival, which aims to project a positive, inclusive, and forward-looking image of Balochistan , countering stereotypes and highlighting its immense potential for tourism, investment, and cultural exchange. As Dawood Tareen aptly summed up, \"Balochistan is not just a land of mountains and deserts-it's a land of stories, songs, flavors, and traditions that deserve to be celebrated. This festival is our way of inviting the world to see the real Balochistan: peaceful, welcoming, and full of life.\" The Balochistan Grand Tourism Festival 2025 thus stands as a powerful reminder that beyond the headlines lies a province where culture meets nature, and tradition meets tomorrow.",
