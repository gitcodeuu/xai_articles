    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 08 (APP):A shocking incident occurred in the federal capital on Wednesday when Ehsan Elahi, Director Land of a government department, was gunned down in Blue Area, one of Islamabad's busiest commercial districts. The killing has sparked concern across official circles and prompted swift action from the federal government. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi took immediate notice of the incident and sought a detailed report from the Inspector General of Islamabad Police. He directed that the case be investigated from all possible angles and that those responsible for the murder be traced and arrested without delay. \"Every aspect of the killing must be thoroughly investigated,\" the Interior Minister said. \"The perpetrators should be apprehended at the earliest and brought to justice.\" Naqvi further instructed law enforcement authorities to ensure that no negligence or loophole hampers the investigation process. He emphasized that the family of the deceased must be provided full justice, assuring that the federal government stands with the bereaved family in their time of grief. \"No effort will be spared in ensuring justice for the victim's family,\" the Minister affirmed. According to initial police reports, the incident took place in the evening hours when unidentified assailants opened fire on Ehsan Elahi's vehicle near Blue Area. The attackers fled the scene immediately after the shooting. Law enforcement agencies reached the spot soon after the incident and cordoned off the area. Forensic teams collected evidence, while police have begun geo-fencing and reviewing CCTV footage from nearby buildings to identify the culprits. Police sources said that different teams have been constituted to investigate the motive behind the killing, which could be related to professional disputes, land matters, or personal enmity. The Interior Ministry and Islamabad Police have assured the public that significant progress is expected soon. Meanwhile, the body of the deceased has been shifted to a local hospital for post-mortem, and a case has been registered against unidentified suspects. The tragic incident has once again highlighted growing concerns about security in the federal capital, particularly in high-security zones like Blue Area.",
