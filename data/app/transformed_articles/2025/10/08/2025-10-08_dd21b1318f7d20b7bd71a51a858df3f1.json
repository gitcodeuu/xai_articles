The meeting was attended by CDA Member Planning and Design Dr. Khalid Hafiz, Member Finance Tahir Naeem, Deputy Director General Resource, and other senior officers. Chairman Randhawa emphasized the CDA's commitment to transforming Islamabad into a modern, world-class capital through innovative projects under the Joint Venture (JV) model. \"The JV model will encourage investment in Islamabad and generate sustainable revenue for the Authority. All projects will be implemented in line with PPRA rules, ensuring transparency and merit,\" he said. During the discussions, the ARAMCO delegation was briefed on several ongoing and planned initiatives under CDA leadership, including projects aimed at enhancing citizen services and promoting economic growth. Chairman Randhawa highlighted that strategic sites are available for private sector investment, including the establishment of petrol pumps across Islamabad. The meeting also focused on a proposed state-of-the-art slaughterhouse, for which the feasibility study has already been completed. Chairman Randhawa explained: \"The primary objective of this project is to promote meat exports while fulfilling domestic demand. This will also contribute to the city's economy and employment opportunities.\" Special teams from CDA and ARAMCO have been tasked with working together to advance practical steps toward these projects. \"Our goal is to provide the best facilities to the citizens of Islamabad. CDA is working day and night to develop the Capital and to promote private sector investment,\" Chairman Randhawa said.",
