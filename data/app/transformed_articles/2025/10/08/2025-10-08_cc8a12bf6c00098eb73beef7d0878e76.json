    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 8 (APP): First Lady Bibi Aseefa Bhutto Zardari on Wednesday appreciating China's role as one of the leading global investors in renewable energy expressed Pakistan's desire to further promote cultural, tourism, and educational exchanges between the two countries. She was talking to President of China-Asia-Africa Trade Promotion Office Ms Hao who called on her at the Aiwan-e-Sadr today. Aseefa Bhutto Zardari said that Pakistan, being an agriculture-based economy, could greatly benefit from China's modern agricultural technologies and expertise. She said efforts were underway to introduce efficient irrigation methods and reduce water wastage in the agriculture sector. Ms Hao informed the first lady that Pakistan and China would celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year, an opportune occasion to further deepen cooperation in student and cultural exchanges, as well as vocational training for farmers. She also invited the first lady to visit China to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to advance collaboration in these areas. Senator Sherry Rehman and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla were also present during the meeting.",
