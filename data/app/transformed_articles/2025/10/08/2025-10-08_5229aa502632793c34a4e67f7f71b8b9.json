    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 08 (APP):Acting Chairman Senate Syedaal Khan on Wednesday met with the newly-elected office bearers of the Parliamentary Reporters Association (PRA) at the Parliament House. During the meeting, detailed discussions were held on parliamentary coverage, the constructive role of media, and the promotion of public awareness. Syedaal Khan said that the media plays a vital role in strengthening the democratic system. He noted that parliamentary reporting is a highly significant and responsible field of journalism that enhances public understanding by delivering accurate information regarding legislation and policymaking to the people. Syedaal Khan remarked that the media serves as a strong bridge between the public and policymakers, and that transparency and positive reporting foster trust and stability within society. He emphasized that collaboration among the government, private sector, and media is essential for sustainable development. The media, he said, should continue to uphold and strengthen its positive traditions in promoting national interest, progress, and stability. The Acting Chairman Senate appreciated the positive role of journalists associated with parliamentary reporting, acknowledging their efforts in building an effective link between the Parliament and the people. He further highlighted that a large portion of Pakistan's population consists of youth, who are a valuable national asset. Their energy and potential, he said, can play a vital role in the country's progress. Syedaal Khan stressed that harmony among Parliament, business, and the media can yield sustainable outcomes, as these three pillars are fundamental to national development. Congratulating the newly-elected office bearers of the Parliamentary Reporters Association, the Acting Chairman Senate said that those elected through a democratic process truly deserve appreciation. He expressed confidence that the new leadership would continue the association's positive traditions and further promote the highest standards of journalism. Referring to the current situation in the country, Syedaal Khan said that the nation needs unity at this time. He urged that differences must be set aside, and collective efforts are required to overcome the challenges facing the country. He noted that the Upper House represents the federation, with equal representation from all four provinces, providing a crucial platform to formulate a joint strategy on national issues and challenges. The Acting Chairman Senate also mentioned the Prime Minister's visit to the United States, highlighting that the visit included important meetings and exchanges with global leaders, providing Pakistan an opportunity to effectively project its position on international forums. On this occasion, PRA's newly-elected President M.B. Soomro and Secretary General Naveed Akbar also shared their views. They thanked the Acting Chairman Senate for his time and also highlighted the issues being faced by media workers and stressed the need for legislation to ensure the protection of their rights.",
