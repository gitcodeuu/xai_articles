    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): Chairman Prime Minister's Youth Programme Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan strongly condemned Afghanistan's recent provocations along Pakistan's border areas, commending the Pakistan Army for its decisive and effective retaliation. He reaffirmed that Pakistan will never compromise on its territorial integrity, emphasizing that the nation stands united behind its armed forces like a \"fortified wall.\" In a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Youth Programme on Sunday, Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan said that under the courageous leadership of Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army has given a befitting response to the enemy's aggression. \"The sacrifices of our brave soldiers defending the country's borders are unforgettable,\" he said, adding that the entire nation takes pride in the professionalism and patriotism of its armed forces. He stated that Pakistan's defense institutions have always responded effectively to hostile actions and conspiracies, and the youth must draw inspiration from the bravery and sacrifices of the armed forces. Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan further noted that Pakistan has repeatedly warned Afghanistan against allowing its soil to be used by terrorist elements. \"The disruptive forces operating from within Afghanistan are attempting to destabilize Pakistan,\" he cautioned. Expressing hope, he said Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government to ensure that its territory is not used for terrorism and to eliminate all such threats from its soil.",
