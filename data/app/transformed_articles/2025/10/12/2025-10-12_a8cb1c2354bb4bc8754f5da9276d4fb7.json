Paying tribute to the Pakistan Army for its timely and effective response, the minister said that Pakistan desires peace in the region but will never compromise on its defence and sovereignty. \"Pakistan will not tolerate any violation of its borders. We are a peace-loving nation but fully capable of defending our territorial integrity,\" Magsi emphasized in a message. He urged the Afghan authorities to ensure that their soil is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan, warning that any aggression will be met with a firm response. \"Pakistan will continue to thwart all conspiracies hatched by anti-state elements. The sacrifices of our armed forces have further strengthened the resolve and courage of the nation,\" Magsi added.",
