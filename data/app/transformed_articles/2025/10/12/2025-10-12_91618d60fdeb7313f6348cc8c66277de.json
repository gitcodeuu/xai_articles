    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) has announced that the nationwide polio immunization campaign will commence from Monday across 159 districts of the country. According to the NEOC, during the week-long drive, more than 45.4 million children under the age of five will be administered oral polio vaccine drops. In addition to the polio vaccine, children will also receive Vitamin A supplements to help boost their immunity. The national campaign will be conducted from October 13 to 19, while in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the campaign will be held from October 20 to 23, the NEOC said. Over 400,000 health workers will go door-to-door to ensure that every eligible child receives the vaccine. The NEOC urged parents to ensure that all children under five years of age are vaccinated against polio and that routine immunization courses for children up to 15 months are completed on time. The polio eradication campaign is part of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to eliminate the crippling disease and protect every child from lifelong disability.",
