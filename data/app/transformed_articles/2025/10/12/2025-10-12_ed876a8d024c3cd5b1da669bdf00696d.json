    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): The three-day Balochistan Grand Tourism Festival concluded at the National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) on Sunday, bringing to an end a weekend-long celebration of the province's culture, music, crafts and tourism potential. The festival, organised by the Department of Culture and Tourism, Government of Balochistan, ran from October 10-12 and drew large crowds from Islamabad and surrounding areas. The final day featured a widely attended Balochi food festival offering traditional dishes such as Sajji, Kaak, Landhi, Dampukht and dates from Turbat; a youth workshop on adventure and sustainable tourism; and panel sessions on investment opportunities and heritage conservation. The festival closed with a grand cultural finale featuring live performances by Balochi singers, musicians and dance troupes, followed by a joint rendition of \"Yeh Des Hamara Hai\" by schoolchildren from Balochistan and Islamabad. On Friday, the inaugural ceremony was addressed by the Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti and Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Aurangzeb Khichi, addressed the gathering. Bugti noted that initial assumptions about a lukewarm reception were disproved by the enthusiastic turnout and described the event as evidence of the nation's hospitality and of Balochistan's tourism potential from the Gadani coast and Ziarat hills to its deserts and forests. Federal Minister Aurangzeb Khichi praised the initiative as a step toward promoting cultural unity and showcasing the province's artistic and natural heritage. Throughout the three days, visitors explored stalls showcasing Balochi handicrafts, embroidery, pottery, jewelry and rugs, watched live craft demonstrations by artisans from across the province, and attended screenings and storytelling sessions that highlighted Balochistan's folklore including the tales of Hani and Sheh Mureed and the poetry of Mast Tawakali. The panel discussions brought together government officials, tourism experts and members of the private sector to discuss infrastructure, connectivity and public-private partnerships needed to sustainably develop the province's tourism industry. Organisers, including the Department of Culture and Tourism and Parliamentary Secretary Mir Zarain Khan Magsi, said the festival aimed to present a positive and authentic image of Balochistan and to encourage greater cultural exchange and tourism interest in the province. The event concluded amid applause and a sense of renewed enthusiasm for promoting Balochistan's cultural and tourism offerings nationwide.",
