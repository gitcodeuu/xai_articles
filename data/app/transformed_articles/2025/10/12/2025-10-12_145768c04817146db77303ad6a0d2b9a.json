    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): The Islamabad district administration carried out inspections at 24,603 sites and confirmed 28 new dengue cases in the last 24 hours as part of its ongoing anti-dengue campaign across the city. According to the spokesman of ICT administration, the Islamabad district administration has stepped up its anti-dengue drive to prevent the spread of the virus across both urban and rural areas. According to the latest daily report, surveillance and preventive measures were conducted citywide, covering homes, public places, and open areas. During the past 24 hours, field teams inspected a total of 24,603 locations, identifying potential mosquito breeding sites. As part of the campaign, spray operations were conducted in 179 houses, while fogging was carried out at 652 different sites across the capital to eliminate mosquitoes. The report stated that 28 new dengue cases were registered during this period. Of these, 15 patients were confirmed from rural areas, and 13 from urban sectors. To ensure medical care, 16 patients were shifted to hospitals for treatment. Larva detection surveys revealed the presence of dengue larvae at 430 sites, while four sites tested negative. The findings prompted the administration to intensify fogging and spray operations, particularly in high-risk areas identified through surveillance data. Officials said strict action is being taken against those violating dengue prevention standard operating procedures (SOPs). Several locations were sealed, and multiple arrests were made for non-compliance. The administration has also directed field teams to maintain momentum and ensure regular monitoring in all sectors. A spokesman stated that the campaign would continue without interruption until dengue cases are brought under control. aThe anti-dengue operations will not slow down under any circumstances,a the spokesperson said. The administration urged citizens to cooperate by keeping their surroundings clean and ensuring no standing water is left in open containers, rooftops, or lawns, which can serve as breeding sites for mosquitoes. Residents have been advised to immediately report any detection of larvae to the district control room, enabling quick response by field teams. The administration further emphasized that collective efforts between government teams and the public are essential to control the dengue outbreak and prevent new cases from emerging. With daily surveillance, large-scale inspections, and coordinated field operations, the district administration aims to reduce mosquito breeding sources and ensure the safety of residents during the ongoing dengue season.",
