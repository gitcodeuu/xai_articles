    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senate Parliamentary Leader Irfan ul Siddiqui on Sunday called for the complete eradication of terrorist safe havens, urging the nation to rally behind the armed forces in this critical mission. In a post on X, Siddiqui-who also serves as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs-commended the security forces and emphasized that safeguarding every Pakistani citizen and defending every inch of the country's territory is both a constitutional obligation and a professional duty of the nation's valiant armed forces. He asserted that the time has come to take decisive action against terrorists. Expressing deep concern over ongoing cross-border terrorism, Siddiqui noted that Pakistan has suffered immensely due to instability in Afghanistan over the past 45 years. He questioned how long the nation would continue to endure terrorists infiltrating its borders, shedding innocent blood, and retreating to safe havens across the frontier. He called for firm and immediate action to break this deadly cycle. Siddiqui further stated that even in these critical times, those who show sympathy for terrorists or misuse state resources to support them must be held accountable. \"They must be asked what Pakistan has done to deserve such betrayal,\" he said.",
