    "article_body": "LAHORE, Oct 12 (APP):Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif has strongly condemned Afghanistan's provocations in Pakistan's border areas, expressing deep concern over the hostile actions and reaffirming that there will be no compromise on Pakistan's defense. The Prime Minister paid rich tribute to the Pakistan Army for its strong and effective response to Afghanistan's aggression. \"We are proud of the professional excellence of our armed forces,\" he said. Shehbaz Sharif praised the bold leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, under whose command the Pakistan Army not only gave a powerful response to Afghan aggression but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat. \"There will be no compromise on Pakistan's defense, and every act of provocation will be met with a strong and effective response,\" the Prime Minister reaffirmed. \"Our defense is in strong hands, and we know well how to defend every inch of our motherland.\" He said the Pakistan Army has always given a crushing reply to every form of external aggression and emphasized that the entire nation stands firmly with Pakistan's security forces. The Prime Minister added that Pakistan has repeatedly provided Afghanistan with information regarding terrorist elements such as Fitna-tul-Khawarij and Fitna-tul-Hindustan, who are using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan. \"Terrorist organizations are being supported by certain elements within Afghanistan,\" he stated, expressing hope that the Afghan interim government will ensure its territory is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan.",
