    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): In a major crackdown on unsafe milk, the Punjab Food Authority (PFA) has inspected more than 500,000 dairy points, milk shops, and collection centres across the province since January 1. The PFA spokesperson told Wealth Pakistan that fines totaling Rs267 million on sellers found guilty of adulteration and contamination has been imposed during this period. Pakistan produces around 70 billion liters of milk annually, however a vast majority of the country's 124 million consumers lack access to safe milk, as less than 10 percent of total production is pasteurized before reaching the market. Industry experts say over 90 percent of milk is sold as loose, raw milk by traditional milkmen. Dr. Muhammad Junaid, consultant at the Federal Ministry of National Food Security and Research, told Wealth Pakistan that pasteurization which is the process of heating milk to a specific temperature to kill harmful bacteria is essential for public health. \"Pakistan's pasteurization industry is too small to meet the fast-growing demand, especially in major cities like Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, and Rawalpindi,\" he said. The high cost of setting up processing plants and lack of cold-chain infrastructure have slowed industrial growth, he added. He said that without proper chilling and transport facilities, raw milk spoils quickly, prompting many middlemen to use harmful adulterants such as ice, soda, or even formalin to delay the spoilage. Pakistan Dairy Association (PDA) CEO Dr Shehzad Amin told Wealth Pakistan that processed milk makes up less than 10 percent of total consumption, leaving most of the people dependent on informal sources. \"The formal milk market is not only small but also highly consolidated,\" he said. Dr Ali Haider, a Lahore-based nutritionist, told Wealth Pakistan that consuming unpasteurized milk with high bacterial loads contributes to digestive disorders and allergies. \"Many diseases linked to indigestion and allergies can be prevented through pasteurized milk,\" he said. Dr Ali said that cultural preferences also hinder adoption of packaged milk. \"People often prefer loose milk because boiling it forms a creamy layer or malai, which they think indicates freshness. Packaged UHT milk doesn't produce malai due to homogenization, and some consumers mistakenly find it less tasty for tea or yogurt,\" Dr. Haider explained. Experts and industry stakeholders stress that ensuring safe milk across Pakistan requires expanding pasteurization facilities, strengthening cold-chain systems and nationwide awareness campaigns to educate consumers about the health benefits of processed milk.",
