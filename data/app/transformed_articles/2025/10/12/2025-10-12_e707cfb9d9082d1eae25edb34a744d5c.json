    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): Prime Minister's Coordinator on Information & Broadcasting for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, condemned the recent unprovoked attack of Afghan forces along the border areas and applauded the response by Pakistani forces. In a statement issued on Sunday, Ikhtiar Wali said Pakistan has always preferred peace, but any act of aggression would be met with firm action. He highlighted Pakistan's decades-long support for Afghanistan and noted its generosity in sheltering Afghan refugees over the years, adding, \"In return, they have waged a proxy war inside Pakistan with the collaboration of India, the eternal enemy of Pakistan and Islam.\" Meanwhile, he also warned India that any nefarious design against Pakistan would be replied to with full force. India should avoid initiating a 'Sindoor-2' operation from the Afghanistan border, he reiterated, saying any such move would be met with a crushing response. The Pakistani nation stands firm with its forces, Ikhtiar Wali Khan said. The India-Afghanistan nexus would be exposed to world, he emphasized.",
