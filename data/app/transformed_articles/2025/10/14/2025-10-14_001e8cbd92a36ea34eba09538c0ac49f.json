In a statement issued on Tuesday, he stated, \"Those who protect innocent children from disability are the true heroes of the nation, while those who attack them are enemies of humanity and criminals of the nation.\" He reaffirmed that under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the government's resolve to root out the menace of terrorism was stronger than ever. Ikhtiar Wali Khan emphasized that no matter how many obstacles the enemies of Pakistan place in the path of our children's future, the country will emerge as polio-free.
