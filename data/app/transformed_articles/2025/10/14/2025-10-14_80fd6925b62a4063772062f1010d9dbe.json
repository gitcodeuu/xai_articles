    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP): As the capital's food scene continues to expand, one thing remains certain - the love for biryani is here to stay. The aromatic rice dish continues to hold a special place in the hearts - and on the plates - of the people of the capital. Despite the growing popularity of fast food and international cuisines, traditional biryani remains one of the city's most cherished meals. From small roadside stalls to upscale restaurants, the aroma of steaming biryani fills the air across markets and food streets. Some of the most popular destinations for biryani lovers include Al-Naz Biryani in Sector G-6 Aabpara, Chaman Biryani in Blue Area, Biryani Hut in Jinnah Super, Karachi Biryani House in Bani Gala, and Hot n Chilli Chilman Biryani in Sector F-10. Biryani stalls have also been set up across the capital, offering authentic flavors that attract people from all walks of life. Talking to APP, Aqeel, who has been running a biryani stall for over a decade in Sector G-6, said the dish was traditional and everyone's favorite. \"The demand for biryani exists in all four seasons - it rarely dips, no matter the weather,\" he shared, adding that biryani was a profitable business throughout the year. \"I strongly recommend this business to anyone wishing to pursue it,\" he added. Maryam, a frequent buyer, told APP that she often ordered biryani, calling it one of her all-time favorites. \"I can eat biryani every single day if it were provided to me - without complaint,\" she said with a smile. Residents of all ages agree that biryani offers comfort, flavor, and a sense of togetherness. In conversation with APP, Zarmina, a university student, said that whether it's a family dinner or an office lunch, biryani is always on the menu. \"It's one of those dishes that brings everyone together - the aroma, the flavors, and the excitement when the lid is lifted just make every gathering special. You can never go wrong with biryani!\" she remarked. Food experts believe the dish's enduring appeal lies in its perfect balance of spice, aroma, and tradition. Culinary writer Amna noted that biryani connects people to their roots. \"It's not just food - it's a story of heritage and flavor passed down through generations,\" she said. According to local delivery services, biryani remains the most frequently ordered dish in the capital, particularly during weekends and festive seasons. With new variations such as chicken, beef, mutton, and even vegetable biryani gaining popularity, the dish continues to evolve while preserving its traditional charm.",
