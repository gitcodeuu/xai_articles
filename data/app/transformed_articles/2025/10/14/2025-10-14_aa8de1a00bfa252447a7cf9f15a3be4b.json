    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday extended the stay order on the auction of 20 cricket and football grounds in the federal capital. Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the petition wherein the IHC issued notices again to the CDA and the Metropolitan Corporation and sought their response. The petitioner said that the sports grounds are for the common citizens, which the CDA cannot auction for a huge amount. According to the law, the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MC) can take over the management of the sports grounds, not the CDA. The petitioner said that there is a risk that the auction of the sports grounds will close the cricket and football grounds to the common citizens. The court extended the stay order and adjourned hearing of the case.",
