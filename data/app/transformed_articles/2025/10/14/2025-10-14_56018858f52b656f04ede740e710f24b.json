    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP):The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) has advised all universities conducting the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) 2025 to ensure pre-hoc analysis of examination papers to maintain quality, fairness, and alignment with the prescribed syllabus. The MDCAT 2025 will be held on Sunday, October 26, 2025, with a total of 140,125 registered applicants. The test will be conducted nationwide across 35 examination centers, including an international venue in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The examination will be organized by the universities including University of Health Sciences (UHS), Lahore, Sukkur IBA University, Khyber Medical University (KMU), Peshawar, Bolan University of Medical & Health Sciences (BUMHS), Quetta and Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU), Islamabad According to a statement issued by PM&DC, the test will be conducted by these universities nominated by federal and provincial authorities - not directly by PM&DC. However, as a regulatory body, PM&DC has provided all exam-conducting universities with a uniform policy framework, test structure, and access to a national item bank to ensure standardization across the country. PM&DC emphasized that all universities must strictly adhere to the Council's prescribed standards in paper setting, development, and printing. Universities are required to ensure that no question falls outside the approved syllabus and that complete secrecy and confidentiality are maintained throughout the process. Question papers will only be opened in the presence of authorized officials and witnesses. The Council further directed universities to ensure that admit cards or roll number slips are issued to candidates at least seven days before the test, allowing sufficient time for verification and preparation. Additionally, the universities are responsible for preparing and declaring the MDCAT 2025 results within seven days after the examination to ensure transparency and timely communication with all candidates. PM&DC reaffirmed its commitment to upholding merit, transparency, and quality in medical and dental education across Pakistan.",
