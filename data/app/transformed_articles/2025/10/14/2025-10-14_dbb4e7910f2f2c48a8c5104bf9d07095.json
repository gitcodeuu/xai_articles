    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP): First Lady Bibi Aseefa Bhutto Zardari on Tuesday strongly condemned the attack on an anti-polio team in Swat's Matta area, which resulted in the martyrdom of a Levies officer, Yaseen. Expressing profound grief and sorrow over the tragic loss of life, the first lady said that those who targeted health workers and security personnel, engaged in the noble mission of protecting children from preventable diseases, were the enemies of humanity, President Secretariat Press Wing said in a press release. She paid tribute to the martyred Levies officer for his courage and commitment to duty, noting that his sacrifice would always be remembered. Bibi Aseefa Bhutto Zardari reaffirmed that the eradication of polio remained a top national priority and emphasised that such cowardly acts could not shake Pakistan's resolve to ensure a healthy, safe and polio-free future for every child. The first lady extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family and prayed for the departed soul.",
