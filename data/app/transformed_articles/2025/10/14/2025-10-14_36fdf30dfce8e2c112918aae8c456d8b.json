    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP): Islamabad is brimming with color and anticipation as preparations for the much-awaited Lok Mela are in full swing at Lok Virsa, promising another grand celebration of Pakistan's cultural diversity and unity. Organized annually by the National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa), the festival brings together artisans, folk musicians, dancers, and performers from every province, transforming the federal capital into a vibrant hub of traditional art, craft, music, and cuisine. Scheduled to take place from November 7 to 16 at Lok Virsa, this year's Lok Mela invites visitors to \"celebrate Pakistan's colors, crafts, and culture-all in one place.\" According to Lok Virsa's official announcement, the event will feature captivating cultural pavilions representing Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir, along with an expanded international pavilion showcasing global cultures side by side with Pakistan's heritage. Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Aurangzeb Khichi, announced that this year's Lok Mela will host pavilions from around 12 foreign countries which is twice as many as last year, reflecting the growing international interest in Pakistan's cultural showcase. He reaffirmed that his ministry would extend all possible support to initiatives that promote the soft image of the country and foster cultural exchange and understanding. Each provincial pavilion will highlight the region's distinctive traditions through folk performances, handicrafts, and local cuisines. From Punjab's lively rhythms and Sindh's intricate ajrak prints to Balochistan's artistic expressions and the charm of Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir, the event will offer visitors a vivid glimpse into Pakistan's rich cultural tapestry. Beyond cultural displays, the mela will feature musical evenings, storytelling sessions, and interactive craft workshops, allowing visitors to experience the creative process firsthand. Traditional food stalls will offer an array of regional specialties, giving attendees a true taste of Pakistan's culinary diversity. Lok Virsa officials said arrangements are being made to ensure a welcoming, family-friendly environment, with special attention to crowd management and security. Since its inception in 1981, Lok Mela has served as a cultural bridge, celebrating the spirit of unity in diversity and promoting Pakistan's rich folk heritage at home and abroad. The event is expected to draw large crowds, including foreign tourists and culture lovers, eager to experience the colors, crafts, and rhythms that define the essence of Pakistan. As Islamabad gears up for the festivities, the air is already alive with excitement - and soon, the city will once again echo with traditional beats, laughter, and the vibrant spirit of Lok Mela.",
