    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday directed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to decide the applications within one month filed by the affectees of Shah Allah Ditta and C-13 of the capital. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, hearing the case, remarked that the officer who works is worthy, the one who does not should go home. The court rejected the miscellaneous petition to stop the transfer of a deputy commissioner of the CDA involved in the case, expressing its anger over the lawyer's request. The lawyer requested that a deputy commissioner involved in the case is being transferred, and the transfer of this officer should be stopped until the final decision is made. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani remarked that you are recommending an officer to the court. It is not the job of the court to recommend any officer. The court has no sympathy for any officer. Why not send the matter to the Prime Minister that you are seeking a recommendation in the court? Justice Mohsin Akhtar said that if someone is going on deputation, let him go. Don't talk about such things here. He is a public servant, there is no special feature in an officer. Have you come here for your work or have you come to save the job of an officer, the court asked. The court rejected the miscellaneous application for the transfer of the CDA Deputy Commissioner and directed the CDA to decide on the applications of the C-13 victims within a month and adjourned the hearing of the case till next month.",
