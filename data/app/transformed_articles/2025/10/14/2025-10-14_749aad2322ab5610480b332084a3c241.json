Upon their arrival, a contingent of Pakistan Rangers presented a formal salute to the distinguished guests.

The guests also recorded their reflections in the visitors' book, acknowledging Allama Iqbal's enduring intellectual and spiritual contributions to the Muslim world. Following the mausoleum visit, the delegation toured the historic Badshahi Mosque. Officials from the Walled City of Lahore Authority guided them through the mosque's architectural grandeur and briefed them on its historical and cultural significance as a symbol of Islamic heritage in South Asia.
