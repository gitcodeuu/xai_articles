    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP):A delegation of women lawyers from Balochistan's Makran and Rakhshan Divisions called on Deputy Chairman Senate, Syedaal Khan, at the Parliament House on Tuesday. The Deputy Chairman warmly welcomed the delegation and expressed his pleasure that women lawyers from the remote and underdeveloped areas of Balochistan were visiting Islamabad to participate in a training course at the Judicial Academy. He remarked that the women of Balochistan are highly talented, intelligent, and determined, and they can play a vital role in the development of both the province and the country. The Deputy Chairman stated that women hold a fundamental position in the progress and development of society, and no nation can advance without their participation. He further said that the present government is committed to empowering women and is providing them with increasing opportunities in various fields so that they can contribute effectively to national development. The Deputy Chairman noted that Balochistan, despite being underdeveloped, is a province rich in natural resources. Projects such as the Gwadar Port have the potential to transform Balochistan into a hub of regional and international trade. He added that the Federal Government is making sincere efforts for the development and prosperity of Balochistan and is giving special attention to infrastructure, education, health, and energy sectors. Syedaal Khan urged the women lawyers to utilize their abilities and energy positively and play an active role in the progress of their province and the country. He emphasized that the advancement of women in Balochistan would serve as a guarantee for the overall development of Pakistan. The delegation of women lawyers also apprised the Deputy Chairman of the issues faced by them in the Makran Division and other areas. The Deputy Chairman assured the delegation that their concerns would be conveyed to the relevant authorities and every possible cooperation would be extended for their resolution.
