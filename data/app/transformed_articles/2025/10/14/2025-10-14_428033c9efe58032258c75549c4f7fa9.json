    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP):Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi on Tuesday reaffirmed that there would be no compromise on the safety and comfort of Pakistan Railways' drivers, emphasizing that passenger convenience remained a top government priority. Chairing a meeting to review the performance and ongoing initiatives of the Peshawar Railway Division, the minister also instructed strict monitoring and enforcement against ticketless travel to ensure compliance and transparency. Hanif Abbasi said Pakistan Railways has entered a new era of modernization, transparency, and public service, reiterating the Ministry's commitment to providing safe, clean and comfortable travel facilities for passengers across the country. Divisional Superintendent (DS) Peshawar Furman Ghani gave an online briefing covering key operational areas, including maintenance, anti-encroachment efforts, cleanliness, and passenger amenities. During the briefing, it was highlighted that train punctuality in the Peshawar Division has reached an impressive 99 percent, reflecting significant operational improvements. The minister was also informed that no complaints regarding bedbugs, mosquitoes, or cockroaches had been received over the past three months, due to a successful fumigation campaign and improved sanitation measures at stations and on trains. Additionally, the DS reported that nine railway stations in the division have been fully converted to solar energy, while the solarization and metering of 1,400 railway quarters have also been completed. Minister Hanif Abbasi appreciated the efforts of the concerned officials and reiterated that the anti-encroachment drive must continue vigorously, with no compromise on the protection of railway land. Expressing satisfaction with the overall performance of the railway divisions, the minister directed that similar detailed briefings be conducted regularly across all divisions.",
