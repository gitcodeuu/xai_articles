    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, October 14 (APP): The second session of the Pakistani Ulema Forum was held in Islamabad under the auspices of the Muslim World League (MWL) on Tuesday, focusing on the theme 'Coordination of Positions and Unity of Stance. The high-level religious forum brought together prominent Pakistani scholars, clerics, and intellectuals to deliberate on the challenges facing the Muslim Ummah and the need for greater unity, wisdom, and cooperation. In a joint declaration issued at the conclusion of the meeting, the participants reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening Islamic brotherhood and fostering harmony among different schools of thought. They underscored that religious scholars play a vital role in guiding the Ummah with wisdom, promoting correct understanding, and disseminating Islam's true message of mercy and peace. The forum emphasized that the Muslim world must rise above division and discord, resolving differences through constructive dialogue and mutual respect. It called for the promotion of tolerance, moderation, and harmony, while discouraging extremism and sectarian strife. The scholars highlighted the importance of the 'Charter for Building Bridges Between Islamic Schools of Thought' issued in Makkah under the MWL, describing it as a landmark document that reflects the noble values of Islam and an unprecedented consensus among Muslim scholars in the modern era. Participants warmly welcomed the recent signing of the strategic defense agreement between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, reached in the presence of Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Pakistan's Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif. The declaration described the accord as a milestone in strengthening Islamic solidarity and enhancing collective efforts to address shared challenges. Reaffirming core principles of Islamic unity, the scholars said all Muslims belong to one Ummah united by one faith, one Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), one Book, and one Qibla. They stressed that unity and cohesion within the Muslim ranks can only be achieved by adhering to moderation, avoiding sectarianism, and upholding mutual respect. The declaration further recognized that the Muslim world possesses immense creative and intellectual potential capable of ushering in a civilizational revival, provided it embraces dialogue over confrontation, consultation over authoritarianism, self-reliance over dependency, and above all, faith in Allah Almighty. Acknowledging the responsibility of scholars and thinkers to safeguard Islamic principles, dispel misconceptions, and promote the values of justice, compassion, and wisdom, the participants reiterated the importance of the MWL's ongoing efforts to unify the Ummah and present Islam's true image to the world. The declaration included several key recommendations; strengthening a unified Islamic voice on global issues to defend shared values, sanctities, and rights; promoting intellectual reform by dispelling misconceptions and fostering a culture of balanced discourse and optimism; expanding scholarly dialogue across different schools of thought to enhance unity, tolerance, and constructive engagement; encouraging practical initiatives and programs that preserve Islamic identity, promote sectarian harmony, and elevate the Ummah's global role, and consolidating public and institutional efforts to uphold the Ummah's shared identity and its balanced civilizational character based on justice, virtue, and benevolence. The forum welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire in Gaza, describing it as a positive step toward ending human suffering. It called for immediate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in the region, endorsing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's efforts to achieve a lasting and just peace based on the two-state solution and ensuring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. The participants also paid tribute to the wise leadership of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for their visionary approach and the conclusion of a historic defense pact that reflects the depth of bilateral relations and thwarts the designs of hostile elements. Concluding the session, the scholars extended heartfelt gratitude to the MWL for organizing this significant intellectual and religious forum and urged the organization to continue holding such purposeful gatherings to further strengthen the Ummah's global leadership role.",
