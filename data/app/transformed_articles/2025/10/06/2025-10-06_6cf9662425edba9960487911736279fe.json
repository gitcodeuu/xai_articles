    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP):Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi on Monday gave a 10-day ultimatum to railway authorities to restore train schedules, stressing that punctuality must be ensured without compromise. Presiding over an important meeting, the minister expressed strong displeasure over repeated train delays across the country. He reprimanded senior railway officials and issued strict directives to all divisions and the headquarters to immediately address the causes behind the disruptions. The officials briefed the minister that the main reasons for delays included the late arrival of power plants and certain technical issues affecting operations. Abbasi said ensuring punctuality, modernization, and digital transformation of Pakistan Railways were among the government's top priorities. He said that passengers must be provided with clean stations and improved travel facilities, terming them vital for restoring public trust. \"The railways cannot be considered fully revived until passengers reach their destinations on time,\" he said, reaffirming his commitment to make punctuality, convenience, and transparency the guiding principles of Pakistan Railways. He reiterated that timely departures and arrivals would remain the foremost focus alongside the ongoing upgradation and digital transformation of the railway system.",
