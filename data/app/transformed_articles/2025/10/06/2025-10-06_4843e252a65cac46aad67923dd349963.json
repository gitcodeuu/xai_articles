    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP): Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazir Tarar on Monday expressed optimism that current differences between the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) would eventually be resolved in an amicable manner. Responding to Sherry Rehman's speech in the Senate, Tarar said, \"As Islamabad's weather cools, so do the emotions. I'm optimistic that relations will improve.\" He urged the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) not to be overjoyed on strained ties between the PPP and PML-N, saying political difference was a normal phenomenon in a democracy where protest was a legitimate right. He assured that water distribution among provinces was being managed by Indus River System Authority (IRSA) according to established criteria. Tarar added that President Asif Ali Zardari had taken cognizance of the issue, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif were committed to reconciliation. He said the recent deluge was a natural calamity, while climate change remained a global challenge - one in which Pakistan had no direct role, yet continued to suffer its devastating consequences. The Punjab government had allocated a substantial amount to compensate victims affected by flooding in three major rivers, he added.",
