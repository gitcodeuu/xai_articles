    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP):The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast mainly dry weather for most parts of the country on Tuesday with chances of rain, wind, and thunderstorms at isolated places in Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir, and adjoining hilly areas. According to the forecast, a spell of light to moderate rain may bring temporary relief from the dry conditions in the northern regions, while the rest of the country will continue to experience dry and warm weather. The department has also issued a weather warning for the evening and night hours, alerting that windstorms, hailstorms, and lightning could damage weak structures such as rooftops and walls of Kacha houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles, and solar panels. Citizens, travellers, and tourists have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel to vulnerable areas and stay updated with the latest weather advisories. In Islamabad, the weather is likely to remain partly cloudy and dry, though the air is expected to feel slightly cooler after recent rains. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, most districts will experience mainly dry weather; however, rain-wind/thunderstorm is likely in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Haripur, and surrounding areas. The PMD cautioned that gusty winds and lightning might occur in upper regions, potentially disrupting travel on hilly routes. In Punjab, the forecast suggests that Rawalpindi, Murree, Galliyat, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujrat, Wazirabad, Lahore, Sialkot, and Narowal may receive rain and thunderstorms at isolated places, especially during the morning hours. The weather in the southern and central districts of the province will remain mostly dry and warm. The new rain spell may help lower temperatures slightly in the Potohar region and nearby hilly areas. Sindh is likely to remain hot and dry, with daytime temperatures reaching as high as 38 C in some cities. Central and southern parts of the province, including Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Jacobabad, will continue to experience warm winds and clear skies. Similarly, most districts of Balochistan will face hot and dry conditions, although partly cloudy weather is expected in coastal towns such as Gwadar, Pasni, and Ormara. Interior Balochistan, including Turbat, Panjgur, and Khuzdar, will stay hot throughout the day. For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, the PMD has forecast partly cloudy weather with rain, wind, and thunderstorms at isolated locations. Snowfall is also likely over the high mountains, which may lower temperatures in nearby valleys and increase the chill in the air during morning and night hours. During the past 24 hours, rain, windstorms, and thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls were reported from several areas of Punjab, Islamabad, Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Hot and dry weather prevailed elsewhere in the country. Murree received the heaviest rainfall of 70 mm, followed by Rawalakot with 68 mm, Mandi Bahauddin with 32 mm, and various areas of Rawalpindi and Islamabad receiving between 19 mm and 31 mm of rain. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kakul recorded 46 mm, Balakot 29 mm, and Pattan 14 mm. In Gilgit-Baltistan, Astore received 3 mm, while Skardu and Bagrot recorded 2 mm each. The highest maximum temperatures recorded during the day were 38 C in Shaheed Benazirabad and 37 C in Turbat, reflecting the persistence of hot and dry conditions in southern parts of the country. The PMD stated that temperatures in northern regions are expected to remain below normal due to ongoing rain activity, while the southern and southwestern regions will continue to experience heat and dryness under clear skies.",
