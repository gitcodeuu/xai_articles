    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP):The Supreme Court's constitutional bench on Monday adjourned until Tuesday the hearing of petitions pertaining to the super tax. The case was heard by a five-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan. During the proceedings, counsel for various taxpayer companies, Barrister Farogh Naseem, continued his arguments, citing several judicial precedents. He stated that his primary objection was related to Section 4C(1). As Barrister Naseem's arguments were still in progress, the bench decided to adjourn further hearing of the case until Tuesday.",
