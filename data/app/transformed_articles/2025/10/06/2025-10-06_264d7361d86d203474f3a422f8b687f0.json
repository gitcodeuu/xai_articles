    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP):Federal Minister for Communications, Abdul Aleem Khan on Monday urged the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to put an end to their ongoing blame game and focus instead on serving the people in their respective provinces. In a statement, Abdul Aleem Khan said that both Punjab and Sindh have elected Chief Ministers and it would be better for them to concentrate on serving the regions from where they have been accorded mandate. He added that the common man is not interested in political point-scoring but in solutions to his fundamental problems and it is hoped that this cycle of statements will now come to an end. The minister emphasized that both PML-N and PPP must prioritize the welfare of citizens as the stability of the nation and continuity of the system should be the real focus. He stated that addressing national issues requires mutual understanding and cooperation as blame-shifting serves neither democracy nor the system. Abdul Aleem Khan noted that political maturity and the current circumstances demand a responsible attitude, expressing hope that the Pakistan Peoples Party will continue supporting the federal government. He added that stability in both Punjab and Sindh is essential and that resolving the problems of ordinary citizens without discrimination must be the shared goal. He further said that to overcome the challenges facing the country, foresight and political wisdom are required. He stressed that all sincere efforts being made to steer Pakistan out of its difficulties must be supported. \"We cannot serve the people or strengthen the political system through accusations against one another,\" he said. Adding that the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party expects both major political parties PML-N and PPP to end their recent exchange of statements and devote all their energies and resources to resolving the real issues of the people, he concluded.",
