    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP):Chairman of the Kashmir Council European Union (EU), Ali Raza Syed, called on Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi at the Governor House in Islamabad on Monday. The two discussed the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and Ladakh, as well as India's escalating aggression in the region. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi reaffirmed Pakistan's unwavering support for the Kashmiri people and their right to self-determination, stressing that Pakistan would continue to raise the issue at all international forums. He said India's political and military leadership was issuing war threats to cover up the humiliation of its defeat in May, but Pakistan had the capability to respond strongly and effectively to any aggression. Ali Raza Syed briefed the Governor on ongoing diplomatic and political efforts in Europe to highlight the Kashmir issue, emphasizing that global awareness of India's human rights violations in the occupied territory was increasing. He said that following Governor Kundi's visit to Brussels in August and his meetings with European parliamentarians, the Kashmir cause and Pakistan's position had gained significant attention across European capitals. Both sides underscored the need for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute for lasting regional peace and stability, reaffirming their commitment to continue supporting the Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom. Ali Raza Syed also invited Governor Faisal Karim Kundi to attend the Islamabad launch of the upcoming book \"Kashmir: Wait and See\" by international journalist Cedric Gerbay, scheduled for November. Meanwhile, General Manager Projects, SNGPL Engineer Syed Sajid Hussain Shah, called on Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and briefed him on the ongoing gas pipeline project in Dera Ismail Khan. He informed the Governor that work on the 70-kilometre-long pipeline from Kot Palak to Sago and Sago to D.I. Khan was progressing rapidly and was expected to be completed by December, which would help address gas load-shedding and pressure issues in the areas. He added that another 103-kilometre pipeline from Darazinda to Lakki Marwat was ready for launch soon after the current project's completion. Governor Kundi directed the authorities to further accelerate the work to provide early relief to the public, reaffirming the government's commitment to timely completion of public welfare projects. Engineer Shah said that labour camps had been established at Darazinda, Kot Palak, and Sago to ensure steady progress and timely completion of the project.",
