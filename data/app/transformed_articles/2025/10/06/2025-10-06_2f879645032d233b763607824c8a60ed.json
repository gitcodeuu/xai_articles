    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP): Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) has continued its rigorous enforcement campaign across the federal capital, taking action against over 9,000 drivers and impounding more than 2,500 motorcycles and vehicles between October 1 and October 4. An ITP official told APP on Monday that the drive was initiated under the special directives of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi to ensure discipline and road safety in the city. He said that on the first day alone, 24 FIRs were registered, while hundreds of challans were issued for various violations including 411 lane violations, 346 cases of red-signal jumping and non-standard number plates, 42 cases of underage driving, 273 of double riding, and 84 of driving without a licence. Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (retd) Hamza Humayun said that the ITP's mission is to create a culture of responsible driving and public safety. \"Driving without a licence is not only illegal but a danger to oneself and others. This campaign is aimed at saving lives and promoting traffic discipline,\" he said. However, some citizens have expressed concern over the large-scale impounding of vehicles. Professor Irshad Ahmed, from a local university, said that registering FIRs against minor traffic violators could affect the future of young riders. He added that traffic awareness should begin in schools and colleges so that young people learn the importance of safety before facing penalties. Shabbir Ahmed, a citizen, told APP that while the ITP's efforts are commendable, the impounding of vehicles is creating difficulties for the public. \"People face delays in reaching offices, hospitals, and schools. Authorities should consider these practical challenges before seizing vehicles,\" he said. Another citizen, Sher Ali, said that the strict action mostly affects low-income motorcyclists. \"Most bikers depend on their motorcycles for daily work when their bikes are seized, their entire livelihood is affected,\" he added.",
