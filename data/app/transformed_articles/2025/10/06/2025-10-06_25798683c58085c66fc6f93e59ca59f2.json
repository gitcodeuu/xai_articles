    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 06 (APP): Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan & SAFRON Engr. Amir Muqam addressed 76th Session of the Executive Committee of the UNHCR Geneva, on Monday. The Minister said that Pakistan is pleased to participate in this session of the Executive Committee, received a press release from Geneva. He said that Pakistan appreciates UNHCR for its commendable work in responding to force displacement across the globe and in refugees' management in accordance with its mandate. \"My delegation also congratulates High Commissioner, Mr. Filippo Grandi, for the remarkable services he has rendered during his tenure\", he added. He said that displacement continues to be a serious global challenge, adding that more than 132 million people worldwide are forcibly displaced, including due to conflicts, persecution, violence, and climate-induced disasters. Clearly, most of these humanitarian crises are man-made. He said that on the other hand, resources needed to respond to the growing needs of forcibly displaced worldwide are shrinking rapidly. Federal Minister Engr Amir Muqam said that the international community must support UNHCR in creating conditions that make return home both desirable and sustainable. \"When returnees are welcomed back with meaningful support, they can contribute to the recovery and progress of their societies\" he added. Engr Amir Muqam said that provision of adequate, predictable, and flexible resources to UNHCR remains critical. He said that for over four decades, Pakistan has generously hosted more than four million Afghan nationals, managing one of the world's largest and most protracted refugee situations. Despite our domestic problems-including economic pressures, security challenges, and overstretched public services-we have upheld humanitarian principles by providing safety, access to education, healthcare, and livelihoods to the extent possible, he added. He said that Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable country. Pakistan has endured repeated climate induced calamities, with this year's devastating floods displacing millions, destroying infrastructure, and causing huge economic losses, adding that these events have had far-reaching humanitarian, economic, and social impacts. He said that \"Pakistan reiterates its call for urgent start of the UNHCR's Climate Resilient Fund and other financing mechanisms to support countries most affected by climate change\",. Engr Amir Muqam said that Pakistan continues to combat terrorism, which has severely impacted our people and economy over the years, adding that over 90,000 Pakistanis have lost their lives, and the nation has endured staggering economic losses exceeding 150 billion dollars in this struggle. Federal Minister Engr Amir Muqam said that it is now our shared responsibility to facilitate safe and dignified returns of displaced Afghans to their country. However, durable returns require investments, in countries of refugee origin for-peace, stability, schools, clinics, and livelihoods-to make return viable. Repeated calls for such support, alongside predictable multi-year funding for host countries like Pakistan, have yet to be fully realized, amid donor fatigue and delayed disbursements. He said that in the context of UN-80 and \"humanitarian reset,\" these initiatives must help the UN respond to humanitarian crises more effectively. He said that Pakistan reiterates its commitment to partnering with the international community to find durable solutions to humanitarian situations. Looking ahead, we urge three imperatives: first, urgent investment in the countries of refugee origin for stability and reintegration; second, timely and predictable international support to offset the burdens on host communities; and third, fast track resettlement in third countries, he concluded.",
