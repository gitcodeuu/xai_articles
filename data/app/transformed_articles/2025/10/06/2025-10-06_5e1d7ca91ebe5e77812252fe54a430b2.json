    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, October 06 (APP):A new Saudi relief convoy has arrived in the Gaza Strip, delivering food baskets and infant milk as part of the Kingdom's continued humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. According to the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) on Monday, the aid will help meet the urgent needs of children and families affected by the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to strengthen food security amid the spread of famine across the enclave. The Saudi Center for Culture and Heritage, KSrelief's implementing partner in Gaza, received the convoy and is overseeing the immediate distribution of supplies to beneficiary families across various areas. This latest delivery forms part of the Kingdom's ongoing campaign to support Palestinians in Gaza, underscoring Saudi Arabia's steadfast commitment to alleviating their suffering and addressing the impact of the ongoing humanitarian emergency.",
