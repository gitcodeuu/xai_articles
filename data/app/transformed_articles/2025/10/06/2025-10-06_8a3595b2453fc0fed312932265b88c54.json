Upon arrival, the prime minister was greeted by an official welcome ceremony followed by a smaller group meeting between the two leaders before the delegation-level talks between the two countries, under the leadership of the two prime ministers. The prime minister, who is on a three-day official visit to Malaysia, thanked his Malaysian counterpart for the exceptionally warm welcome and hospitality accorded to him and members of his delegation. During their \"highly constructive and fruitful\" meeting, the two leaders expressed their satisfaction on the steady progress in bilateral cooperation between both sides, following the Malaysian prime minister's visit to Pakistan in October 2024. Both leaders had a detailed exchange of views on the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirmed their shared commitment to further expand Pakistan-Malaysia cooperation, with particular focus on further strengthening economic and trade ties. Both sides also agreed to enhance the quota of halal meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia to USD 200 million. They also expressed their satisfaction on the exports of rice from Pakistan to Malaysia, which had, in fact, exceeded its quota. Both leaders also held detailed discussions on major regional and international developments, including the situation in the Middle East. The Malaysian prime minister praised Pakistan's efforts in a constructive role in the ongoing peace efforts in Palestine, including under the recent initiative of President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Shehbaz also emphasized the importance of enhanced cooperation between Pakistan and Malaysia at multilateral forums including the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), particularly in the context of the complex challenges facing the Islamic world. He reiterated Pakistan's stance on Kashmir and thanked Malaysia for its steadfast support for a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN resolutions. The two leaders further deliberated on strengthening Pakistan-ASEAN engagement. While congratulating the Malaysian prime minister on Malaysia's assumption of the Chair of ASEAN, Prime Minister Shehbaz thanked Anwar Ibrahim for reaffirmation of Malaysia's support for Pakistan's bid to become a Full Dialogue Partner of ASEAN.
