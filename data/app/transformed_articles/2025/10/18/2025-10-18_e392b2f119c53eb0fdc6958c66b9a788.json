    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 (APP): Vice President of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Senator Sherry Rehman has paid tribute to the martyrs and survivors of the tragic Karsaz attack on its 18th anniversary on Saturday. \"On October 18, 2007, the convoy of democracy was attacked by terrorists at Karsaz,\" Sherry Rehman said, adding that it was the deadliest attack in Pakistan's political history against any political party, said in a message through press release received here on Saturday. She noted that more than 180 PPP workers were martyred and hundreds were injured in the horrific incident. \"The wounds of Karsaz remain fresh even today. We salute the martyrs and the injured for their unmatched sacrifice and courage,\" she stated. Senator Rehman said that PPP workers set a new example of loyalty and bravery, standing firm in the face of terror. \"October 18 was not just the day Benazir Bhutto returned - it was the day democracy itself returned to Pakistan,\" she emphasized. She recalled that millions of people had gathered on the streets of Karachi to welcome their beloved leader, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, who returned home with a clear vision and mission - to end dictatorship, extremism, poverty, and injustice. \"The Pakistan Peoples Party has made the greatest sacrifices for the cause of the Constitution and democracy,\" she said. \"Our workers laid down their lives bravely in the fight against dictatorship and terrorism.\" Senator Rehman said the heroism of PPP's loyal workers will be written in golden letters in history, and that the party will never forget its martyrs. \"The PPP will continue to carry forward the mission of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto under the leadership of President Asif Ali Zardari and Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari,\" she affirmed.",
