The story began in the year 2016. After completing his graduation, he decided to pursue higher studies in China. For many young Pakistanis, studying abroad is both a challenge and an opportunity. For His, it was the gateway to a new world academically, culturally, and personally. During his three years in China, he was not only delved deep into his field of study but also immersed himself in the rich and diverse Chinese culture. From walking through the historical corridors of Beijing to witnessing the futuristic skyline of Shanghai, he explored many cities and gained a comprehensive understanding of life in China. These experiences broadened his perspective and gave him a unique appreciation for international cooperation, innovation, and cultural diversity. Then a life-changing opportunity came knocking an offer to join the SCFPP in Pakistan. This power plant, developed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is a symbol of the strong bilateral ties between the two countries. Usman grabbed this incredible opportunity in 2019; after successfully completing his master's program. He began his professional journey, stepping into the practical world with the knowledge, skills, and experiences he had gained during his time in China. Recalls his early days at the Sahiwal Coal fired power plant with a deep sense of pride and gratitude. Beyond professional success, this job brought significant changes to his personal life as well. With a stable income and a fulfilling career, he was able to provide financial support to his family, a responsibility he holds dear. \"Supporting my family is one of my biggest achievements. The comfort and happiness I see in their eyes is worth every ounce of hard work I put in,\" he said, adding, \"This isn't just a job, it's a mission to ensure that homes across the country have light, warmth, and energy.\" His role at the power plant also served as a bridge between two cultures. This cultural fluency not only enhanced teamwork but also strengthened the spirit of the CPEC initiative, which aimed to bring economic and social uplift to both nations. He appreciated that being in such a productive environment helped individuals understand how their roles contribute to the organization's goals, making their work feel more meaningful and engaging. He encouraged young graduates to look beyond borders and be open to new experiences. \"If I hadn't taken the step to study in China, I might not have had this incredible opportunity. Sometimes, you have to step out of your comfort zone to find where you truly belong,\" he said. As continues to contribute to the SCFPP, Usman remained a shining example of what could be achieved through education, learning, technology, professional growth, cross-cultural collaboration, and dedication.",
