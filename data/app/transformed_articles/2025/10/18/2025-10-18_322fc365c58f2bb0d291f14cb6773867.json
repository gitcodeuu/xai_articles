    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 (APP):Over 70 terrorists belonging to the Khwarij Gul Bahadur group, including several key commanders, were killed in a highly targeted operation in Paktika, Afghanistan, last night. According to security sources, terrorist hideouts of the Khwarij Gul Bahadur group located in Afghanistan were effectively hit in precise strikes. Among the key Khwarij commanders eliminated in the operation were Faraman alias Al-Karama, Sadiqullah Dawar, Ghazi Madakhel, Muqarib, and Qismatullah, the sources said. Moreover, Gulab alias Diwana, Rehmani, Adil, Ashiqullah alias Kausar, Yunus, and Fazl ur Rehman were also killed, they added. The slain Fazl ur Rehman was a close relative of Gul Bahadur, the security sources said. All the killed terrorists were key commanders of the Khwarij Gul Bahadur group and their elimination marks a major success for counter terrorism efforts, they said. The Khwarij Gul Bahadur group has been involved in major terrorist attacks inside Pakistan, infiltrating from Afghanistan to carry out acts of terrorism, they further said. The khwarij group also attempted a failed vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attack in Khadi, North Waziristan, in which three women, two children, and one soldier were martyred, the security sources added.",
