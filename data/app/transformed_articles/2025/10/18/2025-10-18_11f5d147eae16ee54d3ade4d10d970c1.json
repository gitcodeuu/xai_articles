    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistan has targeted verified camps of the Khawarij-affiliated Gul Bahadur group in the border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border. In a post on X, the information minister stated that during a 48-hour ceasefire, militants affiliated with the Khawarij group and operating from Afghanistan attempted multiple terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. He said all such attempts were effectively thwarted by the country's security forces. During the security forces' effective response, over 100 militants affiliated with the Khawarij group were eliminated. The information minister stated that militants from the ex-Gul Bahadur faction of the Khawarij group carried out a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) attack in North Waziristan. The attack resulted in the martyrdom of a soldier and multiple civilians, while several others were injured. Based on confirmed intelligence reports, precision strikes were conducted last night targeting militants from the Gul Bahadur faction of the Khawarij group. The operation resulted in the elimination of approximately 60 to 70 militants, including key leadership figures. All allegations about civilian casualties are baseless and appear to be part of a deliberate effort to garner sympathy for terrorist groups operating from within Afghanistan. Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that Pakistan firmly believes the resolution to the complex challenge of Indian-sponsored terrorism originating from Afghan territory lies in constructive dialogue and effective measures by Afghan authorities to control non-state actors. However, Pakistan reserves the right to protect its territorial integrity and the lives of its citizens, and it will not permit terrorists operating from Afghan soil to act with impunity.",
