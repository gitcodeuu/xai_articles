    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 02 (APP):France has awarded Syed Jamal Shah, a prominent figure in Pakistan's art and culture, the insignia of Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in recognition of his lifelong contribution to the creative field. The ceremony took place at the France ambassador residence in Islamabad where diplomats, artists and cultural figures gathered to celebrate his achievements. The Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, created in 1957 by the French Ministry of Culture, is awarded to individuals whose work has significantly enriched the arts and literature. French Ambassador Nicolas Galey highlighted Shah's journey from Quetta, Balochistan, a region close to the ancient site of Mehrgarh, excavated by French archaeologists. He said his connection to Pakistan's deep cultural roots has shaped his work across sculpture, painting, printmaking and acting. The ambassador praised Shah's role as a mentor, teacher and founder of the Hunerkada College of Visual and Performing Arts, where for 15 years he guided young artists. He added that his belief in art as a tool for resilience and healing reflects values shared by both Pakistan and France. In 2023, Jamal Shah served as Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, where he engaged with Pakistan's vast potential in crafts, folk arts, archaeology and tourism. Earlier, as Director General of the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), he hosted major cultural events in Islamabad. Currently, as Chairman of the Silk Road Culture Centre, he continues to promote diverse art forms and international exchanges. The French Ambassador noted that Shah's career of more than four decades has strengthened cultural awareness and tolerance while fostering collaboration between Pakistan and France. On behalf of the French Minister of Culture, the ambassador presented him with the insignia of Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, acknowledging his contribution to Pakistan's cultural identity and international cooperation.",
