    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (APP): Federal Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives Professor Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday reaffirmed the government's pledge to resolve the public concerns and protests in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) through dialogue and legal means. He was speaking to the media before his departure to Muzaffarabad as part of a high-level committee, constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to assess the ground situation and engage with stakeholders in AJK. \"A high-level delegation is going to AJK capital, Muzaffarabad to assess the situation firsthand and hold talks with the people there,\" he said, adding that wherever legal solutions were possible, the government was fully prepared to play its role in addressing the legitimate concerns of the people of Azad Kashmir. Acknowledging the sentiments of the patriotic local population, the minister urged the calm and caution, amid growing regional and global tensions. \"The current situation in the region, and around the world, is extremely sensitive. There are elements that want to exploit any unrest in Pakistan to further their agendas. It is imperative that we do not create conditions that could be used against the country's peace and stability,\" he added. Ahsan Iqbal assured that the Federal Government was fully aware of the people's concerns and was committed to taking all necessary steps to resolve them in a peaceful and constructive manner. \"We respect the feelings of the people of Azad Kashmir and assure them that their concerns will not be ignored. We hope that, through mutual dialogue, all issues can be resolved in a positive and peaceful environment,\" he remarked.",
