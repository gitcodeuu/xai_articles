    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 02 (APP):The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notices to parties on the appeal of a Station House Officer (SHO) dismissed from service for abuse of authority. A two-member bench headed by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah heard the case. During proceedings, the petitioner's counsel, Umair Baloch, argued that his client had been wrongfully dismissed for the mistakes of other police officials. He maintained that the former SHO was a young man with his whole life ahead of him. Justice Aqeel Abbasi observed that an SHO is the in-charge of the police station and detaining an innocent citizen without reason amounts to abuse of power. Justice Mansoor Ali Shah remarked, \"We do not live in a monarchy where anyone can do as they please. We are bound to decide in accordance with the law. However, the evidence appears to be against you.\" The counsel, however, contended that no complaint had been filed and no witness had testified against his client. The bench adjourned the case indefinitely. It may be noted that former SHO of Chakwal's Dhudial police station, Yasir Muhammad, was dismissed from service on charges of illegally detaining four citizens, including two women.",
