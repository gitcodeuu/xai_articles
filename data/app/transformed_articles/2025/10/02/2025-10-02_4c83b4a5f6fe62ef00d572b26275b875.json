    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (APP):Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday visited Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) to inquire about the health of Islamabad Police and Azad Kashmir Police personnel injured during recent unrest in Azad Kashmir. During the visit, the Interior Minister went to each injured officer individually, asked about their condition, and expressed his appreciation for their courage and commitment. He directed the hospital administration to ensure the provision of the best possible medical care and facilities to the injured personnel. Speaking on the occasion, Mohsin Naqvi lauded the bravery and professionalism of the police officers who, despite facing violent elements, performed their duties with patience, restraint, and remarkable courage. \"You all carried out your responsibilities with extraordinary determination and valor. Despite provocations, you acted with restraint. You are the brave sons of Pakistan, and the entire nation is proud of you,\" the minister said. The Interior Minister further instructed the Chief Commissioner and Inspector General of Islamabad Police to take special care of the injured Azad Kashmir Police personnel. He also personally encouraged the officers, assuring them of the government's support. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining law and order, Mohsin Naqvi stated that while peaceful protest is the democratic right of every citizen, no one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands. \"A handful of miscreants, acting on the directives of hostile forces, are attempting to disrupt peace in Azad Kashmir. Their nefarious designs will never succeed,\" he remarked. The Interior Minister reiterated that the people of Pakistan stand united with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters. He assured that the government is fully committed to addressing the issues faced by the people of Azad Kashmir. Senior officials, including the Chief Commissioner Islamabad and IG Islamabad Police, were also present during the minister's visit. According to hospital administration, 31 Islamabad Police personnel and 12 Azad Kashmir Police personnel are currently under treatment at PIMS Hospital.",
