    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (APP):Members of the delegation nominated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, for the talks with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) have said that the federal government was committed to resolving the ongoing protests and issues in Azad Jammu and Kashmir through dialogue and legal channels. It is hoped that all issues will be resolved in a positive and peaceful environment through mutual dialogue. Talking to the media before the high-level committee left for talks with the Public Action Committee in Muzaffarabad on the instructions of the Prime Minister on Thursday, Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Professor Ahsan Iqbal said that the government was committed to resolving the ongoing protests and issues in Azad Jammu and Kashmir through dialogue and legal channels. Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal said that a high-level committee has been formed by Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif to review the ground situation and hold meetings with stakeholders in Azad Kashmir. He said that we are making a high-level visit to Muzaffarabad to closely review the situation and directly interact with the people. Wherever a legal solution is possible, the government is fully prepared to play its role in resolving the legitimate issues of the people. The Federal Minister, while acknowledging the sentiments of the patriotic people of Azad Kashmir, appealed to remain peaceful and exercise restraint in the region. He said that the current situation in the region and around the world is very sensitive. Some forces want to take advantage of the unrest in Pakistan to achieve their goals. Therefore, it is very important that we do not create such situations that can be used against the peace and stability of the country. The Federal Minister assured that the federal government is fully aware of the problems and concerns of the people and all possible steps will be taken to resolve them peacefully and constructively. He said that we respect the sentiments of the people of Azad Kashmir and assure them that their problems will not be ignored. Prime Minister of Azad Kashmir Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said that on the instructions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, a delegation from Pakistan is going to Muzaffarabad where it will revive the negotiation process that was stalled a few days ago. Earlier, our two esteemed federal ministers had gone to Muzaffarabad, and many issues had been settled with the Action Committee. The people of Azad Kashmir have faced an unpleasant situation due to the situation in Kashmir for the past two or three days. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, while abroad, took notice of this and a high-level delegation is going to remove the deadlock in the negotiations. All the legitimate demands of the Action Committee will be resolved. It is hoped that the people of the Action Committee will remove this deadlock so that the anxiety found among the Kashmiri people can be removed. Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Raja Pervez Ashraf said that the delegation is going to Muzaffarabad to review the situation in Azad Kashmir and resolve them. We regret the loss of human lives in the violent incidents there yesterday; we are making every effort. It is necessary that the legitimate demands of the people of Kashmir are fulfilled and this situation can be brought out of this situation. There may be many intentions of any enemy of Pakistan and Kashmir. He said that the people of the Action Committee are patriotic and honorable people, the best solution for this is to resolve their legitimate demands through talks. This is the desire of the Prime Minister and our party leadership. They are part of our body, their problems are our problems. We want to resolve their legitimate demands. Come together. Every problem can be solved by sitting. The current situation is likely to cause further damage. He said that Kashmiris should sit with us with patience and forbearance. I am fully confident that a solution will be found. Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah said that on the instructions of the Prime Minister, a delegation of different parties is going with the hope and passion to talk to resolve the issues. Matters get complicated by violence; they do not get resolved. They are our brothers. We sympathize with them. Let us find a way to resolve their legitimate demands that is in accordance with the constitution and law and by following it, this problem can be resolved and peace and stability can be achieved. Peace is maintained. He said that we are going under this spirit and I am sure that if we sit with the Action Committee, we will resolve the confusion. Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam, said that we thank the Prime Minister for taking an interest. The delegation includes very experienced people. Our effort was to find a peaceful solution to the issues. That is why we held talks. Now we are going to talk to them again. We are going with sincere intentions and will sit together and find a solution to the problems. Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf said that we should go to Azad Kashmir and talk to the Public Action Committee. The solution to every problem is in talks. We are all responsible people. We will accept the legitimate demands of the Action Committee. This is the Prime Minister's directive. The Action Committee is also expected to find a solution to this problem through talks. Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that a high-level delegation is going to Muzaffarabad. We are making every effort to resolve the issues peacefully through talks. Violence is not the solution to any problem. No. Former federal minister and Peoples Party leader Chaudhry Qamar Zaman Kaira said that they will try to resolve the issues through dialogue and understanding. The solution to every problem lies in dialogue. He said that we expect the protesting Prime Minister of Pakistan to cooperate with us in this effort.",
