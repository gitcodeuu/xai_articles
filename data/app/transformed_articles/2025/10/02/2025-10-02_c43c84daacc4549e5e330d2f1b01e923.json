    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 02 (APP): Federal Minister for Science and Technology, Khalid Hussain Magsi has said that pollution is one of the greatest challenges to Pakistan's health, environment, and economy, emphasizing that tackling it requires collective efforts at every level of society. He was addressing an interactive session titled \"The Solution is to Reduce Pollution\" organized by the Pakistan Science Foundation (PSF) at its auditorium in Islamabad on Thursday. The event brought together students, teachers, young scientists, and media representatives for a thought-provoking discussion on climate change and sustainable solutions. Highlighting the urgency of the issue, the minister said Pakistan is among the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, where melting glaciers and extreme weather patterns pose grave risks to the country's agriculture-based economy. \"Restoring ecological balance and reducing pollution is the need of the hour,\" he stressed, adding that the government's policies play an important role, but the country's future is directly linked with the vision and actions of its youth. The minister underlined that students, teachers, and young researchers are the true drivers of real change.\"A strong sense of ownership of the country is the foundation of national progress,\" he noted, calling upon the youth to play a frontline role in awareness campaigns and initiatives against environmental degradation. He said that shifting to green energy, expanding tree plantation drives, and promoting sustainable scientific research are key to mitigating climate change effects. \"Pakistan can only become prosperous and sustainable through collective efforts,\" the minister remarked. Speaking on the occasion, he reaffirmed that Pakistan Science Foundation has always promoted scientific thinking and research for the welfare of society. The session concluded with an open discussion where participants shared ideas on practical measures to combat pollution and climate change.",
