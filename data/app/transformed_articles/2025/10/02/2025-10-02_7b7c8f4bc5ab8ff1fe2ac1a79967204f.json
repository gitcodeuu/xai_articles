    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (APP):Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan on Thursday chaired an important meeting of the National Highways & Motorway Police (NHMP) to review the overall performance, policy implementation and future strategy of the Force. Expressing dissatisfaction over the current performance, Federal Minister made it clear that the primary duty of the Police is to serve the public, not to provide domestic services to officers. He directed that all official staff posted at officers' residences must immediately be withdrawn and report back to offices. He emphasized that no officer will be allowed barbers, cooks, or personal attendants from the official staff, said a press release. Abdul Aleem Khan further instructed that there must be 100% enforcement of over-speeding and axle load policies. He announced that fines will be imposed on vehicles exceeding 120 km/h while First Information Reports (FIRs) will be registered against those driving over 150 km/h. To prevent accidents and raise public awareness, he also directed the launch of awareness campaigns at entry points, distribution of pamphlets and installation of warning boards. The minister stressed the need for greater vigilance against crimes on Motorways and asked NHMP to submit practical and concrete proposals regarding their respective jurisdictions. The meeting also reviewed proposals to outsource the vehicle fitness inspection system and to introduce electronic monitoring on the pattern of developed countries. Highlighting the need for efficiency and accountability, Abdul Aleem Khan remarked that lavish attitudes will not be tolerated. \"Reduction in unnecessary expenditures and tangible performance will be the true benchmarks,\" he added, urging the bureaucracy to move beyond traditional practices and adopt practical solutions. Issuing a one-week deadline, Federal Minister instructed the Motorway Police to demonstrate clear improvement in performance, warning that strict measures will follow in case of failure. He added that only through better performance will the Motorway Police qualify for further incentives. Abdul Aleem Khan emphasized that holding offices is not a privilege but a responsibility to serve the nation, underscoring: \"We must dedicate ourselves fully to this country.\" The meeting was attended by the Federal Secretary for Communications, Inspector General of Motorway Police and senior officials. Briefings were also given on linking the Safe City project with local police and other relevant institutions.",
