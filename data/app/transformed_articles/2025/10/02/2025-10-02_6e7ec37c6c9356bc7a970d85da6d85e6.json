    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (APP/UNA):The Union of OIC News Agencies (UNA) and the King Salman Global Academy for Arabic Language (KSGAAL) jointly organized a virtual seminar on \"Standards of Arabic Language Usage in the News Agencies of the OIC Member States.\" The seminar brought together representatives from member news agencies and media professionals to discuss the importance of linguistic standards in news agencies and ways to regulate and improve them. The seminar emphasized the need for precise Arabic language and unified standards to regulate media expression, draft messages, and measure performance quality. The participants discussed the challenges faced by non-Arabic-speaking member agencies in regulating linguistic usage, including common mistakes and ways to overcome them. The seminar concluded with recommendations to enhance Arabic content exchange, develop a unified linguistic guide, create a glossary of media and political terms, and provide training courses for employees. Director-General of UNA, Mohammed bin Abd Rabbo Al-Yami said, \"Attention to linguistic standards is part of caring for the Arabic language, which represents a fundamental pillar of Islamic identity.\" Head of the Sector of Linguistic Planning and Policy at KSGAAL Prof. Dr. Mahmoud Al-Mahmoud said, \"Media language is not merely a linguistic issue, but a tool of influence and a source of credibility.\" The seminar aimed to consolidate the role of the Arabic language in shaping media discourse and ensure its quality, coherence, and professionalism.",
