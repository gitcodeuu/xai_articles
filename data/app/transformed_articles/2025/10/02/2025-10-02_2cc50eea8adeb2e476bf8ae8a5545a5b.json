    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (APP):Chairman Prime Minister's Youth Programme (PMYP), Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, addressed the International Dialogue Ceremony at Serena Hotel today, underscoring that the future of Pakistan lies in technical and skills-based programmes that can equip the country's vast youth population for both domestic and global opportunities. He said that Pakistan's youth policy is no longer limited to conventional education alone. \"We are investing not just in education but also in climate change adaptation and the green economy,\" he noted, emphasizing the government's commitment to align youth empowerment with emerging global trends. Rana Mashhood highlighted that the Prime Minister's Youth Programme is actively serving millions of young people, providing them with facilities, opportunities, and access to training platforms. He said youth can now register themselves online from their homes, making PMYP one of the most accessible government programmes in the region. Sharing figures, he revealed that over 7,000 companies have registered with PMYP, offering jobs, internships, and training placements for Pakistani youth. \"Our young people are excelling at home and abroad, and they continue to bring pride to the nation,\" he said. He also referred to the recently launched National Youth Employment Policy (NYEP), which he called a \"game changer\" for the country. The policy envisions providing 1.8 million jobs abroad for Pakistani youth, establishing employment exchanges in every district, and reducing the number of youth who are neither in education, employment, nor training (NEETs). The NYEP prioritizes green jobs, entrepreneurship, and women's participation, while identifying ten strategic sectors including IT, agriculture, health, manufacturing, tourism, logistics, and overseas employment. Expanding on this, Rana Mashhood said the government is tackling the critical challenge of the labor market, where 2-3 million youth enter annually, while national training capacity is only around 400,000. He stressed that bridging this gap through skill development and international opportunities is essential for sustainable growth. Earlier this week, Pakistan's youth vision was also presented globally at the OIC Youth Capital 2025 Volunteers and Youth Gathering in Marrakesh, Morocco, where PMYP representatives showcased the Digital Youth Hub and highlighted volunteerism as a driver of social transformation. Reaffirming the government's resolve, Rana Mashhood said: \"Pakistani youth are the true strength of the nation. Under the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, we are determined to provide new avenues for skills, education, entrepreneurship, and global exposure, so that our youth can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world.\" He stressed that with 68 percent of Pakistan's population below the age of 30, investing in young people is not a choice but a necessity. The chairman emphasized that youth development will remain central to Pakistan's economic future and international standing.",
