    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 25 (APP):Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) has issued a traffic diversion plan for Shaheen Chowk on Margalla Road, where construction work is currently underway. The plan will remain effective daily from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. to maintain smooth traffic flow during peak hours. An ITP spokesperson told APP on Saturday that under the plan: Motorists coming from E-11 and DCI Road should use F-10 Service Road via Jinnah Avenue. Those travelling from Ninth Avenue toward Margalla Road should take a right turn from F-9 Park Gate 5 and use F-8 Park Road. Similarly, commuters from Margalla Road to F-10 should turn left from Faisal Chowk to access Jinnah Avenue, or use PN Zafar Chowk (F-8, near Ali Medical Center) to reach Jinnah Avenue or Ninth Avenue. The official said that ITP officers are deployed on roads to ensure uninterrupted traffic flow. \"We regret any inconvenience caused during the diversion period,\" he added. He further advised motorists to contact the Pucar-15 or 1915 helpline for real-time traffic updates or in case of any emergency, reiterating that ITP remains fully committed to facilitating the public and ensuring safe, orderly movement across the capital.",
