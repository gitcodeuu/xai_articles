    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP):President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday appreciated the continued engagement and technical support of the United Nations and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in helping developing countries, including Pakistan, to improve road safety systems. The president made these remarks during a call-on paid at him by UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Road Safety, Jean Henri Todt, here at Aiwan-e-Sadr, a Presidency news release said. Welcoming Todt and his delegation, the president acknowledged his leadership and advocacy for global road safety, noting his pioneering role as the first Special Envoy for Road Safety appointed by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. He said Pakistan's hosting of the Regional Transport Ministers Conference (RTMC) on 23-24 October 2025 marked an important regional step towards safer and more connected transport networks. Pakistan, he added, is committed to reducing road traffic fatalities through stronger regulation, enforcement, and public awareness. The president outlined Pakistan's ongoing efforts to upgrade road infrastructure and modernise traffic management systems. He reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to building a safer, more inclusive, and sustainable transport network. President Zardari expressed confidence that the Office of the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy and UNECE would continue to work with Pakistan to advance shared goals on road safety. Todt informed the President that road accidents claim nearly 1.2 million lives across the world every year. He noted that reducing this alarming number requires concerted efforts towards better road safety education, stricter law enforcement, improved quality of roads, and safer vehicles. He further pointed out that road crashes also cause economic losses worth billions of dollars globally each year. Senator Sherry Rehman and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla were also present during the meeting.",
