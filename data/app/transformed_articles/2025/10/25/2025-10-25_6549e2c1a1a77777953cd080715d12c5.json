    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP):Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that the timely completion of development projects in the federal capital would not only provide greater convenience to citizens and improve traffic flow but also project a positive image of Pakistan to the world. He expressed these views while addressing the foundation-laying ceremony of the Shaheen Chowk Underpass here. The ceremony was attended by federal ministers, members of parliament, local notables, and senior officials from the Ministry of Interior and the Capital Development Authority (CDA). Highlighting the government's focus on rapid urban development, the PM said the construction of the new underpass would significantly ease traffic congestion on major roads of the capital, ensuring smoother vehicular movement and saving citizens' time and fuel. Commending the Ministry of Interior and its team for their efforts in accelerating developmental work, Shehbaz Sharif said that ongoing beautification and infrastructure projects would enhance the capital's image ahead of the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit scheduled to be held in Islamabad. \"With the fast-paced completion of these projects, we are not only improving public convenience but also showcasing Islamabad and Pakistan as a well-planned, modern, and vibrant city,\" the prime minister remarked. He reiterated his government's commitment to completing all projects that serve the national interest and contribute to public welfare. Earlier, the prime minister was briefed on the project details before formally laying its foundation stone. In his address, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the underpass would help alleviate traffic pressure on Margalla Road. He added that work on 11th Avenue had already begun and that new projects, including the Kashmir Chowk Underpass, would soon be launched. Minister Naqvi further noted that, keeping in view the upcoming SCO Conference, Islamabad was being developed according to international standards, with efforts underway to transform it into one of the region's most modern and beautiful capitals within a year.",
