    "article_body": "HYDERABAD, Oct 25 (APP):The National Disability and Development Forum (NDF) observed World Polio Day in Hyderabad. In his statement, Abid Lashari, President of NDF Pakistan, emphasized that polio vaccines and drops remain the only effective solution to eradicate polio. He acknowledged that the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), Government of Sindh, is taking serious steps to eliminate polio through vaccination drives, awareness campaigns, and community mobilization by engaging civil society organizations (CSOs) to create public demand for immunization and polio drops. However, Lashari expressed concern that several districts are still reporting new polio cases, which is an alarming sign despite ongoing efforts. He further added that NDF Pakistan, in collaboration with the GAVI Alliance, District Health Office (DHO) Hyderabad, and HELP NGO, is making its utmost efforts to control vaccine denial cases, raise awareness on immunization, and support polio eradication drives at the Union Council level.",
