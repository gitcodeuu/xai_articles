    "article_body": "Dera Ismail Khan , Oct 25 (APP):In a joint operation aimed at ensuring food quality and public health, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Food Safety and Halal Food Authority, under the directives of Director General Wasif Saeed and Deputy Commissioner Dera Abdul Nasir Khan, conducted inspections across various milk shops in the city. The operation was supervised by Deputy Director Food Authority Dera, Sajad Ahmad, with active participation from the Livestock Department and the Assistant Commissioner Dera. During the inspection, milk samples were collected from different vendors along Multan Road and the main vegetable market. According to initial testing, several outlets failed to meet the prescribed food safety standards. Consequently, one shop was sealed for non-compliance, while others were fined for selling substandard products. The inspection team also issued on-the-spot instructions to shopkeepers to ensure hygiene and maintain quality standards in the supply of food products to consumers. Deputy Director Sajad Ahmad reaffirmed the authority's commitment to providing the public with safe, hygienic, and high-quality food, emphasizing that no compromise would be made on public health. He added that the Food Safety Authority's regular monitoring and enforcement actions would continue to guarantee the availability of safe and standard food items to the citizens of Dera Ismail Khan.",
