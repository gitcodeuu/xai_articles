    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 25 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Saturday, felicitated the entire nation, especially those Pakistanis residing in the United Kingdom, on the commencement of Pakistan International Airlines' direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester. The prime minister also lauded the efforts of Minister for Aviation Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Civil Aviation Authority, PIA and the officials of the relevant entities in this regard, PM Office Media Wing said in a press release. \"With the grace and blessings of Allah Almighty, Pakistan's image is being restored across the world,\" he said, adding the suspension had damaged PIA's reputation, which has now been restored after years of dedicated efforts. The prime minister further observed that Pakistani community living in the UK would greatly benefit from these direct flights.
