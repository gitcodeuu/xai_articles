    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): Pakistan and Iran have expressed their resolve to further enhance bilateral cooperation, particularly in the fields of railways, communication, and connectivity. Both sides emphasized the need to formulate a joint action plan to strengthen partnerships and future collaboration. The understanding was reached during a meeting between Federal Minister for Railways, Hanif Abbasi, and Iran's Minister of Road and Urban Development, Farzana Sadiq, held on the Regional Transport Ministers' Conference. Discussions focused on expanding cooperation in freight operations and trade connectivity, with both ministers reaffirming their commitment to deepening collaboration in infrastructure development and operational linkages. Minister Hanif Abbasi said Pakistan attaches great importance to its cordial relations with Iran - a brotherly and neighboring country - noting that bilateral ties have witnessed notable improvement in recent years. He highlighted that Pakistan's railway system has been connected with Iran's network since 1917, underlining the need to further strengthen infrastructure and operational cooperation. Referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vision for a modernized railway sector, Abbasi said that Pakistan Railways is undergoing a comprehensive upgradation process aimed at improving efficiency and regional trade connectivity. He added that the freight transport system from Karachi Port will be enhanced, and expressed hope that work on the 884-kilometer-long Rohri-Kundi section would commence soon.",
