    "article_body": "LAHORE, Oct 25 (APP):Under the vision of Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif for a safe and peaceful Punjab, Dera Ghazi Khan Police have carried out extensive and highly successful operations against terrorist and criminal elements across the district. The operations, led by District Police Officer Capt (retd) Tariq Walait, forced terrorist groups to retreat from their hideouts and flee the area. According to police spokesperson, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had approved a special grant of Rs 280 million for Dera Ghazi Khan Police two years ago to enhance the district's security capacity. The funds were utilised for procurement of modern weapons, thermal drones, night vision cameras, bulletproof vehicles and an upgraded communication system, while border check-posts were also strengthened with cutting-edge surveillance technology. These resources have significantly boosted the operational strength and morale of the police force, enabling decisive actions against terrorist and criminal networks. DPO Capt (retd) Tariq Walait said that search and combing operations were conducted in Basti Marha, Jadday Wali, Kot Mubarak, Ramzan Nala, Darah Qila, Basti Langah, Fort Munro, Wahwa and Taunsa, resulting in the destruction of several hideouts, recovery of a large cache of arms and ammunition and safe recovery of a seventh-grade student abducted from Kot Mubarak. The DPO expressed gratitude to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and IGP Dr Usman Anwar for their guidance and supervision, adding that Dera Ghazi Khan Police remained committed to dismantling criminal networks and restoring public confidence in law enforcement agencies.",
