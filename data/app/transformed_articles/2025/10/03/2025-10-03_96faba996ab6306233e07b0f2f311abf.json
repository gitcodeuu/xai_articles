    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 03 (APP):The Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) convened a high-level roundtable conference on Friday, bringing together world-renowned climate and disaster resilience experts, senior national professionals from federal and provincial departments, and representatives of development partners and donor agencies to deliberate on a national flood resilience strategy. The conference, organized under PEC's mandate, focused on Pakistan's recurring challenge of annual flooding and the urgent need to shift from a reactive to a preventive approach to mitigate its devastating impacts. Building on the expert insights shared at the forum, PEC is formulating a comprehensive framework that will include a 12-month short-term action plan and 1-3 year medium-term strategy. These plans aim to transition Pakistan's flood management from ad-hoc crisis responses to a systematic, coordinated, and accountable approach. The framework will prioritize reducing the impacts of flooding on communities, livelihoods, essential services, agriculture, food security, and the overall economy in 2026 and beyond. Highlighting PEC's commitment, the Council assured close collaboration with government institutions and relevant stakeholders to significantly reduce flood damages in the coming year. Concluding the session, Chairman PEC, Engr. Waseem Nazir, stressed that \"business as usual is no longer an option.\"",
