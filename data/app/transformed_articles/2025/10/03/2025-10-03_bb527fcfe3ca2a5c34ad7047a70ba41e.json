    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 3 (APP):Minister of State for Finance and Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani undertook a test ride on the Etihad Rail, traveling from Al Faya Depot in Abu Dhabi to Al Qudra in Dubai during the Global Rail and Infrastructure Conference and Exhibition, reflecting Pakistan's commitment to advancing regional transport cooperation and innovation. According to a message received here, the test ride, organized by Etihad Rail, marked a milestone in the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) first national railway project, slated for commercial launch in 2026. Designed to link 11 cities across the Emirates, the network will feature passenger trains reaching speeds of up to 200 km/h, promising a fast, efficient, and sustainable mode of travel. The project aims to enhance connectivity, support economic growth, and promote environmental sustainability. During his visit, Kayani also toured the control room at the Al Faya Depot, gaining insight into the advanced technologies that will support the operation of the network.",
