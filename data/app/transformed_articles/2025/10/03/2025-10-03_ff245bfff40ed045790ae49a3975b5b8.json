    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 3 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar on Friday assured the National Assembly that Pakistan was actively pursuing diplomatic efforts to ensure the safety and safe return of its nationals on board the Global Sumud Flotilla. The deputy prime minister, addressing the House, condemned the unlawful interception of the Flotilla by Israeli occupying forces, terming it a blatant violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles. Reiterating Pakistan's consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Apprising the House of Pakistan's active engagement during the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, he highlighted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's impactful statement on Palestine, Jammu and Kashmir, climate justice, reform of global financial systems, and the urgency of sustainable development. DPM Dar also underlined Pakistan's extensive diplomatic outreach, participation in high-level events and sideline bilateral meetings, constructive role in advancing peace efforts, and principled advocacy for the rights of the Palestinian and Kashmiri people. He recalled the joint statement issued by Pakistan alongside seven brotherly Arab-Islamic countries, following consultations in New York. He said that the statement called for unrestricted delivery of sufficient humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of the Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, rebuilding of Gaza, and creating a credible path for a just peace on the basis of the two-state solution, under which Gaza is fully integrated with the West Bank. Deputy Prime Minister Dar also briefed the House on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's bilateral meeting with US President Donald J. Trump at the White House, joined by Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir. He noted the cordial exchanges, appreciation for Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts, President Trump's role in facilitating the Pakistan-India ceasefire understanding in May, and the agreement to expand trade while inviting US investments in agriculture, IT, mines and minerals, and energy.",
