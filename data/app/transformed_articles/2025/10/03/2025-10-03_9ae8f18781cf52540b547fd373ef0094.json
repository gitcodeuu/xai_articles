    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 03 (APP):An anti-terrorism court on Friday issued non-bailable arrest warrants for several Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders in a case linked to vandalism during the appearance of the party's founder. Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra of the Anti-Terrorism Court ordered the warrants against PTI leaders Shibli Faraz, Maj. (retd) Tahir Sadiq, and Ali Nawaz Awan. The action was taken in connection with case number 153 registered at Ramna Police Station. The accused are facing allegations of rioting and damaging property during the PTI founder's court appearance. During the proceedings, the court also directed the Ministry of Interior to send another letter concerning the PTI founder and sought a report on his nephew, Hassaan Niazi. According to court records, PTI leaders Senator Murad Saeed and Hammad Azhar have already been declared absconders in the same case. The court adjourned further hearings in the case until November 1, instructing authorities to ensure compliance with its orders before the next date.",
