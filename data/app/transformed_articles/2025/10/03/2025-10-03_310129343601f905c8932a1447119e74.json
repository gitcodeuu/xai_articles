    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 03 (APP):The hearing of the Toshakhana-II case against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) founder and his wife, Bushra Bibi, was adjourned without proceedings until October 6. The court has directed that the trial will now be conducted on a daily basis until its conclusion. The proceedings before Special Judge Central Shah Rukh Arjumand could not continue after defense lawyer Qausain Faisal Mufti failed to appear due to illness. The court accepted his adjournment request despite the absence of a medical certificate. During the hearing, the judge observed that defense lawyers had also been absent on the previous date, remarking that it appeared they were attempting to prolong the case. The court made it clear that no further delays would be accepted, instructing all three defense lawyers to ensure their presence at the next hearing. The judge underlined that the case was in its final stages and involved two accused currently in jail, stressing that justice required a timely decision. He ruled that the trial would proceed daily until completion. So far, cross-examination has been completed on 19 out of 20 prosecution witnesses. The final witness, NAB investigation officer Mohsin Haroon, has been ordered to appear on October 6 for cross-examination.",
