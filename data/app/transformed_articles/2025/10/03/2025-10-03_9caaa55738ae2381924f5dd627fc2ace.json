    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 03 (APP): Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Friday commended the Security Forces for their successful operation in Shirani district of Balochistan, which resulted in the elimination of seven Indian-sponsored terrorists. In a statement issued from Islamabad, the Interior Minister lauded the \"professionalism, courage, and swift action\" of the Security Forces, emphasizing that the operation had thwarted a major terror plot aimed at destabilizing the province. \"I salute the brave soldiers of our Security Forces for this remarkable achievement,\" Naqvi said. \"Their timely action not only neutralized the terrorists but also foiled the nefarious designs of elements working against Pakistan's peace and stability.\" The Minister underscored that the government fully recognizes and values the sacrifices and contributions of the Security Forces in the fight against terrorism. \"We stand shoulder to shoulder with our forces in this national struggle. Their efforts are central to ensuring lasting peace and security, especially in Balochistan,\" he added. The successful operation comes amid continued intelligence-based efforts to dismantle terrorist networks allegedly sponsored from across the border. Officials have reiterated that Pakistan remains committed to eliminating terrorism in all its forms and will not allow external actors to undermine its internal security.",
