    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 19 (APP):The Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), in collaboration with Dastaan Theatre, successfully staged the powerful theatrical production \"Balkra\", which received overwhelming appreciation from art enthusiasts, social activists, and audiences alike.\\n\\n\"Balkra\" is a bold and thought-provoking play that sheds light on two deeply sensitive and painful realities of society- the abduction and exploitation of children, and the discrimination faced by the transgender community.\\n\\nThrough emotionally charged and unsettling scenes, the play compels the audience to confront the bitter truth that social apathy and silence often serve as the strongest allies of oppression.\\n\\nThe central character, Mojo, symbolizes power, fear, hypocrisy, and coercion - representing the darker side of society that remains unseen yet pervades every institution, class, and conscience.\\n\\nBy exposing religious, moral, and social contradictions, the play reveals how the same society that condemns a song as sin elevates it to sanctity when wrapped in the cloak of devotion, a striking depiction of the double standards that hinder truth and justice.\\n\\n\"Balkra\" is an experimental theatre production that blends elements of proscenium, educational, and third theatre, introducing a unique form of artistic expression. It is more than mere entertainment - it is a form of social protest, a cry that brings to light the silent suffering of children and the marginalized transgender community.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the performance, the audience gave a standing ovation, describing the play's message as \"soul-stirring.\"\\n\\nSpeaking on the occasion, director Arshad Minhas said, \"Balkra is not just about storytelling; it is about unveiling the hidden corners of our society that we choose to ignore. The true role of art is to question and awaken the human conscience.\"\\n\\nThe joint effort of PNCA and Dastaan Theatre stands as both an artistic triumph and a call for social awakening, a powerful reminder that art, justice, and humanity are inseparable.\\n\\n",
