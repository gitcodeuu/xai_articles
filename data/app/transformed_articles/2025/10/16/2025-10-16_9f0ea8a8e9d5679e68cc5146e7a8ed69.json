    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Pakistan, observed World Food Day 2025 here with a national event aimed at promoting sustainable and inclusive food systems. The gathering brought together policymakers, researchers, students, and development partners to discuss practical solutions for ensuring food security and improving nutrition across Pakistan. The event's Chief Guest, Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, said the government is taking concrete steps to strengthen the country's food systems. He stressed the importance of empowering farmers, improving access to safe food, and building partnerships among public and private sectors to make the system more resilient and equitable. A high-level panel discussion titled \"Working Hand in Hand for Food Systems Transformation\" served as the central feature of the celebration. The session was moderated by Dr Qasim Kakar, Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR). Panellists included Lindita Bare, Deputy Country Director of WFP Pakistan; Ayesha Quresh, Country Programme Analyst at IFAD Pakistan; James Robert Okoth, Officer In-Charge of FAO Pakistan; and Amir Mohyuddin, Federal Secretary at MNFSR. The discussion explored ways to increase agricultural productivity, promote climate-smart practices, and ensure better nutrition. Participants highlighted the importance of supporting smallholder farmers, particularly women and youth, through innovation and evidence-based planning. They also underscored the need for close coordination between government institutions, international organizations, and local communities to achieve sustainable results. Ahead of the event, FAO Pakistan organized essay and poster competitions in schools across Islamabad to involve students in the dialogue on food security and sustainable agriculture. The winners were announced and awarded during the ceremony, acknowledging young people's contributions to promoting healthy and responsible food practices. An exhibition was also held alongside the event, featuring innovative farming techniques, community initiatives, and artwork by students. The display gave visitors a chance to learn about practical models for sustainable agriculture and ways to reduce food waste. World Food Day 2025 concluded with a collective call for joint action to transform Pakistan's food systems. Participants agreed that food security can only be achieved through shared responsibility, innovation, and cooperation among all sectors of society. The event reaffirmed FAO Pakistan's commitment to supporting national efforts that ensure access to nutritious food for all while protecting the country's natural resources.",
