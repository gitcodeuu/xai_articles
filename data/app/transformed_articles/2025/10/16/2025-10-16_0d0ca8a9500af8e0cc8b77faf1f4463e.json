    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): The International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) decisively secured its legal and copyrights over its official initialism and logo by winning the case that had earlier been challenged by Ibadat International University, Islamabad. In a ruling reinforcing the earlier decision issued by the Trademark Registry earlier this year, the Registry has once again upheld IIUI's opposition (Nos. 5381/2022, 5382/2022, and 5383/2022), reaffirming IIUI's exclusive rights to its institutional identity, said a press release on Thursday. \"The ruling prohibits Ibadat International University, Islamabad and affiliated institution from using the same or any similar mark, thereby safeguarding IIUI's name, insignia, and institutional distinction,\" it added. President of IIUI, Professor Dr Ahmed Saad Alahmed, warmly congratulated the Legal Section on this remarkable achievement through their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safeguarding the University's interests. The President particularly commended Muhammad Ramzan Khan for his tireless efforts and legal acumen that culminated in this decisive judgment. He noted that the ruling \"resolves the matter conclusively and reaffirms IIUI's rightful claim to its institutional identity and heritage.\" This victory is being celebrated across the university community as a defining moment in IIUI's history, as it reinforces the University's integrity, credibility, and commitment to upholding the values and vision it represents at both national and international levels.",
