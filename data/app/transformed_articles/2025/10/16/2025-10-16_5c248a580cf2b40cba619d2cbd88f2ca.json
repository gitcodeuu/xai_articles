    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP):Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Australian High Commissioner Neil Hawkins held a meeting on Thursday to discuss ways to strengthen Pakistan-Australia relations and enhance cooperation across multiple sectors, particularly border management, coast guard collaboration and efforts to combat human trafficking. During the meeting, both sides emphasized the importance of closer coordination to curb illegal immigration and promote lawful migration channels. Minister Naqvi reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to taking strict legal action against individuals involved in illegal immigration, stating that those returning from abroad after engaging in such activities would face firm legal consequences. He added that authorities are taking \"iron-handed\" action against human smuggling networks. High Commissioner Hawkins expressed condolences over the recent martyrdom of police officers and security personnel in terrorist attacks, acknowledging their sacrifices in maintaining peace and security. The Australian envoy also praised the restoration work at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium and lauded Islamabad's welfare and development projects under Naqvi's leadership, noting visible improvements in the capital. He said he had a memorable experience in Pakistan, describing Lahore's Bibi Pak Daman shrine as his favorite place. Hawkins further noted that Pakistan's international standing and prestige have strengthened in recent years. Minister Naqvi appreciated the Australian High Commissioner's efforts in promoting bilateral relations and extended best wishes for his future endeavors. Minister of State Talal Chaudhry, Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha, and senior officials from the Australian High Commission also attended the meeting.",
