    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): \"Justice, compassion, and human fraternity are universal values shared by all religions,\" said Dr. Mohammad Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League, while addressing a National Symposium on \"Interfaith Harmony and Fundamental Rights - A Constitutional Imperative,\" hosted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Wednesday. The event, jointly organized by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan and the Federal Judicial Academy, brought together eminent jurists, scholars, diplomats and policymakers to reaffirm Pakistan's constitutional and moral commitment to justice, equality and peaceful coexistence. In his welcome address, the Chief Justice of Pakistan observed that interfaith harmony is deeply rooted in the teachings of Islam - long before it became a constitutional imperative. He emphasized that the protection of fundamental rights represents the highest expression of justice, which strengthens the moral fabric of society. Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, National Commission for Human Rights Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha, and Senator Farooq H. Naek also addressed the symposium, highlighting the need to uphold equality, tolerance, and inclusion as essential elements of Pakistan's constitutional democracy. In his concluding reflections, Former Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani said the judiciary has a sacred constitutional duty to safeguard pluralism, equality, and the rule of law. He noted that a just and tolerant society is built when citizens and institutions alike honor these principles. The symposium concluded with the adoption of a \"Declaration on Interfaith Harmony and Fundamental Rights,\" reaffirming Pakistan's resolve to promote unity, mutual respect, and justice as the cornerstones of its governance and national identity. The event was attended by judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, members of the district judiciary, diplomats, representatives of the bar, civil society, and the media. The proceedings were live-streamed nationwide, enabling the judiciary and bar across Pakistan to benefit from the discussions and reflections shared during the event.",
