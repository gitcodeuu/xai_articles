    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani, Thursday, said tourism plays a vital role in economic diversification, job creation and global engagement, describing it as more than a commercial activity - a bridge fostering cultural understanding and people-to-people ties. \"The sector holds immense potential for projecting a positive image of Pakistan globally while empowering local communities and promoting inclusive growth\", the Chairman Senate expressed these views in a meeting with the Malam Jabba International Advisory Board. The meeting brought together distinguished international and national figures to discuss Pakistan's tourism potential and strategies for sustainable development through the Malam Jabba project. Chairperson Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman was also present during the meeting. Gilani extended warm greetings to Lord Amir Sarfaraz of Kensington, a Member of the House of Lords, acknowledging his steadfast support and advocacy for strengthening Pakistan-United Kingdom relations. He lauded Lord Amir Sarfaraz as a true friend of Pakistan whose efforts have significantly contributed to enhancing bilateral understanding, cooperation, and goodwill between the two nations. The Chairman Senate also expressed appreciation for General Patrick Sander for his leadership and strategic insight, noting that his participation would add great value to the deliberations of the Advisory Board. He paid special tribute to the Malam Jabba International Advisory Board for its continued commitment to advancing sustainable tourism and investment opportunities in Pakistan. Referring to statistics, the Chairman shared that international tourist arrivals in Pakistan increased dramatically, reflecting renewed confidence in the sector. Gilani emphasised that domestic tourism has also seen impressive expansion, showcasing a growing public interest in exploring the nation's natural beauty and cultural heritage. He called for parallel efforts to enhance infrastructure, accessibility, and service quality to further attract international travellers and solidify Pakistan's position on the global tourism map. Recognising Malam Jabba as a model destination, the Chairman praised its successful integration of natural scenic beauty, adventure sports, and cultural experiences within a sustainable framework. He added that Malam Jabba exemplifies how public facilitation, private innovation, and community participation can work together to generate employment and stimulate local economies. Speaking on the role of the Senate of Pakistan, the Chairman reiterated that the Upper House considers tourism a strategic enabler of national progress and remains committed to supporting it through legislative, oversight, and diplomatic means. He assured his cooperation in overcoming the challenges being faced by the sector. Yousaf Raza Gilani expressed confidence that the meeting would pave the way for stronger institutional linkages and practical cooperation to develop tourism as a key economic sector. He reaffirmed full support for initiatives aimed at enhancing Pakistan's tourism visibility, improving the investment climate, and ensuring policy coherence. Commending the Malam Jabba project as a model of excellence, the Chairman described it as a true reflection of Pakistan's potential - one that embodies innovation, sustainability, and national pride through vision, partnership, and commitment. He invited UK businesspersons and investors to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan, noting that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) provides a well-integrated platform for facilitating foreign investment.
