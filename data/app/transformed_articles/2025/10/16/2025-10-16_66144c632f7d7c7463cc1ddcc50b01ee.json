    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP):The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Immigration staff at Islamabad International Airport foiled an attempt to travel to Europe on fake documents, offloading two passengers who tried to board Flight EY303 to Italy. An official told APP on Thursday that the passengers, identified as Fayaz Ahmed and Nouman Ali, residents of Mandi Bahauddin, presented counterfeit Italian resident cards along with passports carrying forged Pakistani and Italian immigration stamps. Initial investigations revealed that the passengers had acquired the fake documents by paying hefty sums to local agents. The FIA Immigration staff handed both suspects over to the Anti-Human Trafficking Circle Islamabad for further legal proceedings. A spokesperson said that strict action will also be taken against the agents and facilitators involved in preparing forged travel documents. The spokesperson reiterated FIA's commitment to curbing human trafficking and illegal migration attempts, stressing that vigilant checks at airports remain a top priority for the agency.",
