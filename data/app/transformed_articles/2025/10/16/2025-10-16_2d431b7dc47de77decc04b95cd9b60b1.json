In his message on the occasion of World Food Day, the Speaker said that this year's theme - \"Hand in hand for better food and a better future,\"carried a meaningful reminder of the importance of cooperation in combating global hunger. Ayaz Sadiq noted that food scarcity remains a global challenge, requiring coordinated and sustained efforts at national and international levels. He emphasised that sustainable agricultural policies are essential to achieve food security and economic stability, adding that self-reliance in food production is the cornerstone of a resilient economy. Highlighting the role of farmers, the NA Speaker said that empowering them and encouraging the adoption of modern and climate-smart farming techniques was vital to increasing agricultural productivity. He also called for efficient use of food resources and strict measures to prevent food wastage as a means of reducing poverty and hunger. Ayaz Sadiq pointed out that climate change was increasingly impacting agricultural yields, stressing the need for immediate and effective countermeasures. He reaffirmed that the government was taking steps to promote climate-resilient farming and modern irrigation practices to reclaim arid lands and enhance productivity. Concluding his message, the Speaker reiterated Parliament's commitment to legislation aimed at ensuring national food security, saying that the collective responsibility of all sectors of society was key to building a hunger-free and sustainable future.",
