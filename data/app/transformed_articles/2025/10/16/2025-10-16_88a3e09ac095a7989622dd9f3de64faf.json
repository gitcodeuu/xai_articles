    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP):A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Housing and Works, held under the chairmanship of Senator Nasir Mehmood. The meeting took place at the Old PIPS Hall, Parliament Lodges in Islamabad on Thursday. The Committee reviewed multiple pressing issues including the unauthorized occupation of government property by NAB Courts in Lahore, the stalled induction and unpaid salaries of former Pakistan Public Works Department (PWD) employees, progress on the Kuchlak Housing Project in Quetta, and the long-pending ownership and possession dispute of the Constantia Lodge property in Murree. The Committee reviewed the actions taken by the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Ministry of Housing & Works in compliance with its earlier directions issued in meetings held on April 30, May 20, and August 12. The matter relates to the prolonged, unauthorized occupation of a Ministry of Housing and Works property by NAB Courts in Lahore since March 2021 without a valid rent agreement or any rent payment. The Ministry reported that the premises have since been transferred to the Ministry of Law and Justice; however, the Committee noted with concern that no formal rent agreement has been executed and the property remains in use without compliance with legal and administrative protocols. The Chairman Committee emphasized that such continued unauthorized use of government property is unacceptable. The Committee reiterated that a compliance report must be submitted without delay and directed that either rent be recovered at the prescribed government rates or the premises be vacated immediately. It was stressed that both ministries must proactively resolve the issue internally and avoid further delay in implementation. In its review of the Kuchlak Housing Project in Quetta, being executed by the Pakistan Housing Authority Foundation (PHA-F), the Committee was briefed that the project began in 2020 to develop 350 residential units across 86 acres, with infrastructure work awarded separately. Despite bookings initiated in 2021, over 65% of the work remains incomplete, and several contractor-related delays have impacted delivery timelines. The Committee expressed serious concern over the slow progress and lack of clarity in administrative cost evaluation, especially in light of the fact that many allottees had made significant financial sacrifices to secure homes under the scheme. The issue of whether to re-tender remaining work or continue with existing subcontractors under revised terms was deliberated. It was observed that continuing with the current subcontractor may be more cost-effective and time-saving. The Committee was also informed that penalties had been imposed on defaulting contractors, including NLC, and the possibility of making direct payments to subcontractors was under active consideration. A video presentation showing current on-ground development was shared with members. The Committee, after reviewing the status, recommended a physical site visit on November 15 to assess progress and ensure accountability. The Committee also received a comprehensive briefing on the issues surrounding former PWD employees following the department's dissolution. The Committee examined matters including non-payment of salaries, delays in induction, and failure by departments-particularly the CDA-to comply with the Federal Cabinet decision regarding their absorption, despite the transfer of salary budgets. The Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the prolonged administrative hurdles and directed the Ministry of Housing and Works to resolve all pending inductions and ensure that affected employees are posted, paid, and provided with proper retirement and pension benefits. It was further highlighted that infrastructure in buildings where these employees are to be posted-such as Chamba House (Lahore), Qasr-e-Naz (Karachi), and Federal Lodges/Hostels in Islamabad, Quetta, and Peshawar-remains incomplete, with lifts, AC systems, and basic amenities still pending. The Committee directed the Ministry to ensure timely completion of all works, allocate necessary resources, and present a clear timeline for project readiness and staff accommodation. The Chairman further emphasized that every department receiving employees must ensure their salaries are paid without excuse, and a systematic pension mechanism should be implemented to address long-standing dues, especially for retiring staff. During discussions, the Committee was also briefed on the issue of the 38-kanal Constantia Lodge property in Murree, where the original land file had been missing for years. The Committee was informed that, following consistent efforts, the file has now been recovered and the property officially stands in the name of the Ministry of Housing and Works. It was revealed that there had been a recent attempt to illegally occupy the site, and FIRs had been lodged against those involved. The Committee condemned the attempted encroachment and directed that the property be secured immediately, including construction of a boundary wall, and all planning be initiated to utilize the land for public benefit. The Chairman further instructed that the Commissioner and Revenue Department take immediate action to safeguard government land and coordinate closely with the Ministry of Housing. The Committee emphasized that administrative inaction and weak enforcement embolden illegal encroachments and undermine the rule of law. It also urged that a standard operating framework be developed for such properties to prevent future misuse or delay in development planning. In closing, the Committee urged all departments to improve inter-agency coordination, take timely administrative decisions, and fully implement the Cabinet's directives without bureaucratic delays. The Chairman reiterated that all unresolved matters must be reported back with a clear compliance timeline, and relevant authorities must be held accountable for lapses in their jurisdiction. Senators who were in attendance included Husna Bano, Khalida Ateeb, Muhammad Aslam Abro, Bilal Ahmed Khan, Saifullah Abro, Hidayat Ullah Khan, Secretary M/o Housing and Works, Secretary M/o Interior, and senior officials from the relevant department.",
