    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, October 16 (APP):Saudi Arabia has launched a groundbreaking global initiative to empower small-scale rural producers and promote sustainable livelihoods in crisis-affected regions worldwide. The 'Bathraa' (Seed) initiative, launched in Riyadh by Advisor at the Royal Court and Supervisor General of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) Dr. Abdullah Al Rabeeah, will help transform humanitarian support into long-term empowerment. The launch ceremony was attended by Vice Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture Eng. Mansour bin Hilal Al-Mushaiti, along with senior officials and representatives of development organizations. According to Dr. Al Rabeeah, the initiative reflects Saudi Arabia's vision of linking generosity with empowerment. \"True development begins by empowering people to uplift themselves. The Bathraa initiative is a promise of sustainability, a testament to the idea that even the smallest seed can yield the greatest gift,\" he remarked. He explained that Bathraa was designed to transform suffering into opportunity by helping vulnerable communities become self-reliant through community farming projects, vocational training, technical support, micro-financing, and innovative marketing strategies for local products. The initiative will leverage the combined expertise of Saudi national institutions including the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture and international, regional, and local partners to deliver sustainable and measurable outcomes. Calling on donors, private sector partners, civil society organizations, and social responsibility leaders to join the global effort, Al Rabeeah reaffirmed KSrelief's commitment to implementing the initiative through tangible on-ground projects that drive long-term resilience and food security. Meanwhile, Eng. Al-Mushaiti described KSrelief as a global humanitarian legacy and a distinct Saudi mark. He emphasized that the partnership between KSrelief and the Ministry will connect action with impact, relief with development, and giving with empowerment, aligning with the Kingdom's broader sustainable development goals. He further said Saudi Arabia has emerged as a global model for humanitarian and sustainable development, supported by strong leadership, national expertise, and synergy between the public, private, and non-profit sectors. The event concluded with the screening of a documentary film on the Bathraa initiative, showcasing its role in supporting farmers, livestock breeders, beekeepers, and fishermen by providing seeds, raw materials, training, and marketing support fostering self-sufficiency and strengthening local economies across vulnerable communities.",
