    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday commended the armed forces and security agencies for successful operations in various areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing several Indian-backed Fitna-al-Khawarij terrorists. In separate statements, they said the security forces foiled the nefarious designs of the terrorists through their professional skills. PM Shehbaz Sharif said the security forces eliminated 34 Indian-backed terrorists in Spinwam, South Waziristan and Bannu. He said the government was committed to completely eliminate terrorism from the country. \"Successful operations against the terrorists in North and South Waziristan and Bannu are a matter of pride for the nation,\" President Zardari said noting that the timely actions of the security forces helped improving the law and order situation across the country. Reaffirming Pakistan's firm resolve to eliminate terrorism in all its forms, President Zardari stated that operations under the \"Azm-e-Istehkam\" campaign will continue with full force to their logical end as the security forces defeat terrorists and the nation defeats terrorism. He emphasised that Pakistan will root out the India-backed fitna-e-khawarij and fitna-e-Hindustan and will not rest until the menace of terrorism is fully defeated. The president further said that the entire nation stands firmly behind its Armed Forces and law enforcement agencies in their mission to safeguard the homeland and uphold peace.",
