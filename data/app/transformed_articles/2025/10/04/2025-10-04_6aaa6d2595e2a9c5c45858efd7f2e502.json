    "article_body": "LAHORE, Oct 04 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday expressed optimism that the world is now closer than ever to a ceasefire in Gaza since the genocide of the Palestinian people began. In a message on X (formerly Twitter), the PM said that Pakistan had always stood by the Palestinian people and will continue to support them unwaveringly. He extended gratitude to US President Donald Trump and the leadership of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia for their efforts during the UNGA-80 session, where they met Trump to advance the cause of resolving the Palestine issue. Highlighting recent developments, the Prime Minister said that the statement issued by Hamas offers a ray of hope for a ceasefire and provides a pathway to ensuring peace. He stressed that this opportunity must not be allowed to close again. \"Pakistan, In-sha-Allah, will continue to work hand in hand with its friendly and brotherly nations for permanent peace in Palestine,\" he reaffirmed.",
