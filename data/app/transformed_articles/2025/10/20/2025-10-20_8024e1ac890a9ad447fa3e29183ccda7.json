    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 20 (APP):In a significant stride towards regional integration and transport modernization, Pakistan has reinforced its commitment to international road safety and infrastructure standards, aligning closely with frameworks set by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).\\n\\nAccording to the official document available with APP, it said that Pakistan, despite historical gaps, has made \"substantial progress\" in road safety and axle load regulation. Since November 2023, the National Highway Authority (NHA) has enforced a 100% Axle Load Control Regime across the national highway and motorway network, backed by 210 weigh stations, including 14 mobile units, in coordination with the National Highways & Motorway Police (NH&MP).\\n\\nNHA has intensified its focus on highway safety improvements, aligning with both national priorities and global bes\\n\\npractices. High-risk road segments are being systematically upgraded using methodologies developed by the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP). These upgrades are prioritized based on crash data, traffic volumes, and available financial resources, ensuring a data-driven and cost-effective approach to safety enhancement.\\n\\nRecognizing the critical importance of post-crash response, NHA is actively working with RESCUE 1122 and NH&MP to identify strategic sites for the deployment of ambulance services along major corridors, it added.\\n\\nIt further said that, the CAREC Tranche-III project is currently in the procurement phase, and an inquiry into alleged irregularities has been initiated under the directions of the prime minister. The ministry assured that Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines and PPRA Rule-5 are being followed \"in true letter and spirit\" to prevent corruption and ensure fair contracting.\\n\\nPakistan's key highway corridors including National Highway N-5, Indus Highway (N-55), and the Karakoram Highway (N-35) - play a crucial role in both national and regional connectivity. As part of the Asian Highway Network under the UNESCAP framework, these routes - specifically AH1, AH2, AH4, and AH7 - link Pakistan to South, Central, and East Asia. Beyond supporting domestic trade and mobility, they serve as strategic arteries for international commerce and regional cooperation, it added.\\n\\nHowever, legacy infrastructure constraints and increasing climate-induced disasters continue to challenge full compliance with global standards. To mitigate this, all new infrastructure projects especially those supported by development partners-are now required to adopt climate-resilient design standards, including hydrological modeling, seismic considerations, and slope stabilization. Furthermore, disaster-prone segments are being prioritized for upgrades using NHA's own funds.\\n\\nOn the policy front, the ministry is actively pursuing a shift from transport corridors to economic corridors, with plans to integrate industrial zones and logistics hubs to enhance regional trade efficiency.\\n\\n\"Removing outdated charges such as right-of-way fees on fiber optic installations also signals our broader strategy to support digital infrastructure under the CAREC and UNESCAP umbrella,\" it concluded.\\n\\n",
