    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 20 (APP):National Assembly Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination has expressed serious concern over the non-compliance of approved fee structure circular of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC).\\n\\nThe committee meeting which was held under the Chairmanship of Dr. Mahesh Kumar Malani, MNA, it was informed that despite the prescribed fee limit of Rs.1.8 million to Rs 2.5 million per annum, several private medical and dental colleges continued to charge higher fee.\\n\\nPMDC apprised that 14 colleges have been issued show-cause notices for violations, while further inquiries were underway.\\n\\nMembers emphasized that details of such institutions, including the dates of notices and actions taken, should be shared with the Committee.\\n\\nThe Minister for Health assured that the matter was under active consideration and that a survey was being conducted to verify fee structures across institutions.\\n\\nWhile discussing the Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT), members raised concerns over the two-year validity of test results and the absence of a relative marking system.\\n\\nIt was observed that this policy discouraged high-achieving students from reapplying. The Chair noted that thousands of students had secured above 95 percent marks, yet limited seats left many at a disadvantage.\\n\\nThe Committee advised that the policy be revisited to ensure fairness and equal opportunity for all candidates.\\n\\nThe Minister explained that over 6000 standardized questions were prepared from a common syllabus, divided into sets to maintain transparency, and assured the committee that further consultations would be held with provinces and the National Academic Board to address concerns.\\n\\nDuring the discussion, Members highlighted the need to safeguard the academic future of students in case of college deregistration and stressed that PMDC should exercise proactive regulation rather than relying on post-complaint action.\\n\\nThe Committee took a follow up on its previous recommendations including an unfair delay in the promotion of two employees of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council.\\n\\nIt was noted that both employees had been cleared by the FIA and the Ministry, therefore, the matter should be finalized without any further delay.\\n\\nThe Committee also took up Starred Question Nos. 20, 23 and 49 and the \"Pakistan Nursing Council (Amendment) Bill, 2024\" (moved by Syed Rafiullah, MNA).\\n\\nThe Committee expressed concern over the Ministry's delayed and inadequate response to the issues earlier raised by the Mover regarding irregular appointments and administrative lapses.\\n\\nIt was observed that, despite previous directions of the Committee, no substantial corrective measures had been taken.\\n\\nThe Minister informed the Committee that a new Ordinance had been promulgated to strengthen the governance and autonomy of the Council.\\n\\nIt was clarified that the promulgation of the Pakistan Nursing and Midwifery Council Ordinance did not validate any illegal actions taken prior to its enforcement. Any act committed before the issuance of the Ordinance in violation of existing laws, rules, or regulations remained unlawful and appropriate legal action could be initiated in accordance with the law.\\n\\nThe committee members also emphasized the need for equitable provincial representation and the removal of any discriminatory qualification criteria.\\n\\nThe Chair directed that a dedicated meeting would be held to review the Ordinance in detail, in consultation with the Law Ministry.\\n\\nThe Committee appreciated the efforts of the Minister for Health, who assured the members and the mover that all concerns would be addressed at the earliest.\\n\\nCommittee members raised the issue of medicines being distributed under the names of Parliamentarians without proper verification.\\n\\nThe Committee recommended that an online tracking mechanism be developed to ensure transparency, accountability, and to prevent any potential misuse.\\n\\nThe Committee disposed off \"The Pharmacy (Amendment) Bill, 2024\" (moved by Abdul Qadir Patel, MNA) without any deliberation on the said Bill.\\n\\nThe Chairman reiterated the Committee's commitment to improving the health sector and strengthening regulatory oversight in Pakistan.\\n\\n",
