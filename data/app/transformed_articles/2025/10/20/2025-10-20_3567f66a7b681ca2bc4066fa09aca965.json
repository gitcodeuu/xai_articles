    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 20 (APP): Minister for Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif has said that the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement between Pakistan and Afghanistan is to eliminate the menace of terrorism.\\n\\nIn an interview with Al-Jazeera Arabic, the Defence Minister said that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years.\\n\\nMedia error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found\\n\\nHe said that both countries have reached the conclusion that the immediate eradication of terrorism is essential. The two sides, he added, will make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats.\\n\\nAsif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that the presence of both countries itself serves as a guarantee for the accord.\\n\\nHe appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the head of the Turkish delegation, Ibrahim, in facilitating the agreement.\\n\\nThe Defence Minister said another meeting will be held next week in Istanbul to finalize the details of the agreement. He said an effective mechanism will also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries.\\n\\nAsif said that the Afghan Defence Minister had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which will now be addressed.\\n\\nHe said Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalize.\\n\\nAs a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities will resume, enabling Afghanistan to use Pakistani ports once again.\\n\\nThe Defence Minister said Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents will be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees will continue to be repatriated, he added.\\n\\nAsif said it is premature to claim full satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. \"We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,\" he said.",
