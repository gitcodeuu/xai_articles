    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 20 (APP):The National Productivity Organization (NPO) has helped local industries achieve Rs11.18 billion in productivity-related value addition over the past four years by utilising a total public grant of Rs374 million.\\n\\nOperating under the Ministry of Industries and Production (MoIP), the NPO has significantly expanded its outreach to industrial and service sectors, assisting companies in improving production efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing competitiveness.\\n\\nAccording to official documents available with Wealth Pakistan, the organisation conducted 396 energy and resource audits between 2020 and 2025 in sectors such as textiles, auto parts, leather, surgical instruments, and sports manufacturing.\\n\\nIt also organised 489 national productivity training programmes and hosted 21 multi-country sessions under the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) framework.\\n\\nNotably, Pakistan ranked first among 21 APO member nations in accessing international services, reflecting NPO's growing regional engagement and institutional credibility.\\n\\nThe NPO's financial performance has also strengthened. Its revenues rose sharply from Rs2.13 million in FY2020 to Rs71.29 million in FY2023-24, driven by the increasing demand from firms seeking advisory services for cost reduction, energy efficiency, and productivity enhancement.\\n\\nThe official documents note that countries such as South Korea and Thailand had productivity levels similar to Pakistan's in the 1970s, but they advanced rapidly by investing in technology, skills, and institutional reforms. Recognising this, the NPO partnered with the Korea Development Institute (KDI) to formulate the National Productivity Master Plan (NPMP), which has now been integrated into Pakistan's Special Economic Framework by the Planning Commission.\\n\\nThe NPMP seeks to introduce a national productivity measurement system, promote technological standardisation, and develop productivity-linked incentives to motivate industrial performance. These reforms aim to help Pakistan transition from a cost-based to a productivity-driven growth model.\\n\\nLooking ahead, NPO's Business Plan 2025-28 aligns with the NPMP's objectives. It focuses on technology adoption, process optimisation, and a nationwide productivity awareness campaign to address persistent inefficiencies and strengthen competitiveness.\\n\\nA senior NPO official told Wealth Pakistan that improving productivity is vital for Pakistan's industries to gain global competitiveness. He said sustained efforts through institutional reforms and collaboration with international partners will help reduce dependence on subsidies and currency adjustments, ensuring long-term industrial viability.\\n\\n",
