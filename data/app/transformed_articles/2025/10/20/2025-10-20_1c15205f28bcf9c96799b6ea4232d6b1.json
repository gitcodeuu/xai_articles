    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 20 (APP):Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Aurangzeb Khan Khichi Monday said that Pakistan's cultural diversity is its greatest strength and a vital pillar for national unity, peace, and progress.\\n\\nHe was addressing a Policy Dialogue on Prospects and Challenges to National Cohesion and Cultural Integrity in Pakistan held here on Monday.\\n\\nWelcoming scholars, artists, policymakers, and students, the minister said the dialogue reflected the government's broader vision to promote inclusivity, understanding, and social harmony among Pakistan's diverse communities.\\n\\n\"This Centre has been envisioned as a platform to promote dialogue and inclusivity-a space where culture becomes the bridge that connects our differences,\" he remarked.\\n\\nKhichi said the newly announced Centre for National Cohesion and Outreach would serve as a \"think-and-do tank\" to document Pakistan's cultural plurality, engage youth through art, media, and education, and provide policy inputs for social cohesion.\\n\\n\"It aims to link creative expression with community empowerment, turning culture into a source of resilience,\" he added.\\n\\nHighlighting the growing challenges of polarization and inequality, he said these issues have weakened the social fabric in many societies, including Pakistan.\\n\\n\"When we lose the ability to listen and celebrate diversity, we undermine the very foundation of our nationhood,\" he cautioned, emphasizing the role of institutions like Lok Virsa and new initiatives in rebuilding these connections.\\n\\nReaffirming the government's commitment to strengthening the cultural sector, the minister said the Division would collaborate with universities, think tanks, and international organizations such as UNESCO and UNODC to promote programmes that foster peace, tolerance, and civic values.\\n\\n\"National cohesion cannot be legislated-it must be nurtured,\" he concluded. \"It grows when we invest in dialogue instead of division, and when every Pakistani feels their identity is respected and their voice matters.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Secretary National Heritage and Culture Division Asad Rehman Gillani announced the establishment of the Centre for National Cohesion and Outreach, saying it would harness Pakistan's shared cultural heritage- its stories, songs, and values-to unite people and bridge divides.\\n\\nHe said the Centre would serve as a collaborative space for artists, scholars, and community leaders to promote dialogue, engage youth, and reinforce the vision of a more inclusive and cohesive Pakistan.\\n\\nIn his welcome address, Executive Director Lok Virsa Dr. Waqas Saleem outlined the key objectives of the forum and described it as a vital platform for fostering intercultural understanding and celebrating the region's shared heritage.\\n\\n",
