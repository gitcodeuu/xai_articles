    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 09 (APP):The T-Chowk Flyover project in Rawat, is advancing at a swift pace, with significant construction milestones already achieved, officials confirmed on Thursday. The development is part of the government's effort to improve traffic flow and provide signal-free travel for commuters in the twin cities and those travelling from Lahore and Punjab. Chairman of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, inspected the site alongside CDA officers, the contractor, consultants, and the project director. According to the briefing, piling work for the project is now 100% complete, girder casting is 84% finished, and safety wall construction has reached 60%. Work is reportedly continuing around the clock. Chairman Randhawa expressed satisfaction with the pace of work. \"The T-Chowk Flyover will significantly reduce traffic congestion and provide smooth, signal-free movement for commuters,\" he said. He directed the CDA team to expedite work further to meet deadlines and ensure quality. \"High construction standards must be maintained at all costs,\" he stressed. Randhawa also instructed the development of a landscaping and horticulture plan to enhance the project's aesthetic appeal and called for the installation of permanent LED lighting. \"Cleanliness must be ensured in all completed sections,\" he added, emphasising both efficiency and safety. The T-Chowk Flyover is a key infrastructure project intended to improve connectivity between Islamabad and neighbouring areas, including Punjab, by easing one of the busiest traffic corridors in the capital region. Its completion is expected to reduce travel times, improve commuter convenience, and support economic activity. Construction of the flyover is a central part of the CDA's broader urban development agenda, aligning with Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi's direction to fast-track major infrastructure projects.",
