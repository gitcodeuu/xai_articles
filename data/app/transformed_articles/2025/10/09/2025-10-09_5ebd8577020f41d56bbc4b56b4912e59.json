    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 9 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday calling the Gaza peace agreement between Israel and Hamas a \"historic opportunity\" for lasting peace in the Middle East, praised the leadership of US President Donald Trump and mediation efforts by leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye. \"The announcement of an agreement that will bring an end to the genocide in Gaza is a historic opportunity to secure lasting peace in the Middle East. President Trump's leadership throughout the process of dialogue and negotiations reflects his unwavering commitment to world peace,\" the prime minister wrote on his X timeline. He also applauded the \"resolute and wise\" leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye for their untiring efforts to negotiate a deal. \"Most of all, we must all pay tribute to the Palestinian people-who have suffered in an unprecedented manner, one that should never, ever be repeated,\" he remarked. Prime Minister Shehabz also noted with grave concern, and strongly condemned, the recent provocations at Masjid Al Aqsa. \"The world must hold the occupiers and illegal settlers to account and prevent any further actions that undermine the enormous efforts made by President Trump to reduce tensions and pave the way for lasting peace,\" he added. The prime minister resolved that Pakistan would continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people were established in accordance with their wishes and UN resolutions. Earlier, US President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had signed off on the first phase of the peace plan under which all of the hostages would be released very soon, and Israel would withdraw their troops to an agreed upon line. \"All parties will be treated fairly! This is a great day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this historic and unprecedented event happen,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
