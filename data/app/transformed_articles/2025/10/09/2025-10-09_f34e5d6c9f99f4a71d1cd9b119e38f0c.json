    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 09 (APP):The Islamabad district administration has stepped up its efforts to control the spread of dengue fever as 25 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. Out of these, 18 patients were identified in rural areas and 7 in urban localities, said the spokesman of district administration. In this regard, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon chaired a review meeting to assess ongoing anti-dengue measures and discuss strategies to curb the virus. Senior officers from the district administration and the health department attended the session. The meeting focused on practical proposals and an effective strategy to eliminate dengue larvae and strengthen preventive actions across the capital. During the briefing, officials informed that inspection teams had checked several areas, confirming the presence of larvae at 916 locations, while 12 sites were cleared after follow-up visits. Anti-dengue teams carried out fogging operations at 2,585 sites to prevent mosquito breeding. The meeting was told that strict enforcement actions were also underway against violations of dengue prevention Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). A total of 20 people were taken into custody for negligence in implementing safety measures. The administration said it would continue the crackdown on violators to ensure community health and safety. Deputy Commissioner Islamabad directed concerned departments to speed up fumigation and spraying, particularly in high-risk areas. He said that the campaign should be closely monitored, with daily inspections to ensure effective field operations. He also emphasized that any negligence in anti-dengue efforts would lead to strict disciplinary action. The DC added that protecting public health remains the top priority of the district administration. He said that every possible measure is being taken to contain the spread of dengue and prevent new outbreaks. Continuous surveillance, regular fogging, and timely removal of larvae sources were highlighted as key components of the ongoing campaign. Officials also reviewed the coordination mechanism between health and field teams to ensure timely reporting of dengue cases and swift response in affected localities. The DC instructed all assistant commissioners to personally monitor activities in their respective areas and ensure compliance with anti-dengue SOPs. He said public awareness is equally important in fighting dengue and urged citizens to keep their surroundings clean, remove stagnant water, and cooperate with inspection teams. The administration plans to intensify awareness campaigns in schools, offices, and residential areas to encourage community participation in prevention efforts. The meeting concluded with a decision to maintain strict monitoring of ongoing operations and take immediate corrective action where needed. The DC reaffirmed the administration's resolve to sustain the anti-dengue campaign until the threat is fully controlled. He reiterated that all departments must work in coordination to ensure no gap remains in the control measures. The administration will continue daily reviews to evaluate progress, identify challenges, and strengthen the overall response mechanism.",
