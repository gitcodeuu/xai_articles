    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 9 (APP):As Islamabad transitions from summer's lingering heat to early winter chill, residents are struggling to cope with the city's unpredictable temperature swings. Warm sunshine during the day quickly gives way to sharp cold once the sun sets, leaving people unsure how to dress, plan, or protect their health. Doctors report a steady rise in seasonal illnesses from flu and sore throats to skin allergies and dryness as the fluctuating weather tests the body's ability to adapt. After weeks of extended heat, cool winds have finally arrived in the capital. But the relief has come with a catch. During daylight hours, Islamabad still feels warm and pleasant, while evenings and early mornings bring a sudden drop in temperature. This daily rollercoaster of warmth and chill is causing discomfort for many citizens. \"I love this time of year, but it's confusing,\" said Farah Khan in an exclusive interview with APP, a housewife from G-9. \"It's really cold when my children leave for school in the morning, but by the time they return home in the afternoon, it becomes quite hot. They keep catching sore throats and colds because the temperature changes so quickly.\" Young people are facing the same struggle, especially students who spend long hours outdoors. Sidra Zahra, a university student, shared how the unpredictable weather affects daily life. \"We're completely clueless about what to wear,\" she said with a laugh while talking to APP. \"In the morning, it's cold enough for a light sweater, by noon it feels like summer again, and if I have an evening class, it's suddenly freezing. I end up carrying half my wardrobe in my bag!\" Health professionals say these sudden temperature fluctuations are taking a visible toll on people's wellbeing. Dr. Imran Hassan, a physician at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) told APP that PIMS has seen a rise in patients suffering from respiratory infections, flu, and seasonal allergies. \"When days are warm and nights are cold, the body's internal system becomes confused,\" he explained. \"It takes time to adjust, and if people don't dress appropriately or stay hydrated, their immunity drops. That's why we see an increase in flu, cough, and asthma cases during this transition.\" Along with respiratory illnesses, doctors are also noticing more skin related complaints. The cool, dry air that accompanies the changing season causes skin to lose moisture, leading to itchiness, irritation, and rashes. \"We're seeing many cases of dry, flaky skin, chapped lips, and mild eczema flare ups,\" said Dr. Hassan. \"People should start moisturizing early in the season, avoid very hot showers, and drink plenty of water. The humidity drops quickly, and that impacts the skin more than most realize.\" Outdoor workers and commuters are among those hit hardest. Muhammad Rizwan, a Taxi driver in Blue Area, said, \"It's too hot to wear a jacket during the day, but too cold without one at night. I've already caught the flu twice this month. The dry air also makes my hands rough and itchy,it's not easy working like this.\" The Pakistan Meteorological Department attributes these abrupt changes to broader climate patterns. Transitional seasons like spring and autumn are shrinking across the country, replaced by rapid shifts between extreme heat and sudden cold. Experts warn that deforestation, air pollution, and global climate change are worsening the phenomenon. Health professionals urge citizens to take preventive measures, such as wearing layered clothing, staying hydrated, and using gentle moisturizers to protect skin from dryness. They also recommend avoiding cold drinks and maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits and vitamins to strengthen the immune system. \"The weather's beauty can be deceptive,\" Dr. Hassan warned. \"The sunlight feels comforting, but when evening falls, the cold air quickly catches people off guard. These rapid changes are a reminder that climate instability isn't just an environmental issue it's a health concern.\" As Islamabad enjoys golden daylight and crisp evenings, residents are learning to adapt to a climate that no longer follows predictable rules. The season's charm remains but so does the challenge of staying healthy and prepared amid the city's warm days and cold nights.",
