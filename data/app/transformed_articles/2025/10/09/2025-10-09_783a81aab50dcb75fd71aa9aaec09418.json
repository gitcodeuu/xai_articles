    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 09 (APP): The Government has allocated Rs. 9 billion under the Pakistan Accelerated Vehicle Electrification (PAVE) scheme for the current fiscal year, aiming to subsidize the purchase of approximately 116,000 electric bikes and 3,000 electric rickshaws and loaders. Responding to a query raised by Anusha Rehman during Question Hour in Senate, State Minister for Railways, Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani stated that the initiative falls under the recently launched New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Policy 2025-30, which is aimed at accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles and enhancing local EV manufacturing capabilities. Announced by the Federal Cabinet on August 26, the NEV Policy introduces a comprehensive framework that combines consumer incentives with infrastructure development. The policy was unveiled by the Minister for Industries and Production, who emphasized its role in promoting sustainable transport and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. To support the growing EV ecosystem, the government is also implementing a nationwide regulatory and operational framework backed by Viability Gap Funding (VGF). The plan includes the establishment of 3,000 EV charging stations across the country by 2030.",
