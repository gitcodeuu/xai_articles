    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 09 (APP):Nazaria Pakistan Council (NPC) under its project Taleem Network Pakistan (TNP) has hosted a special event to mark World Teachers' Day. According to a press release issued here on Thursday, the event was attended by members of the Council's Executive Committee, former Secretary Finance Abdullah Yousaf, former Secretary Election Commission Kanwar Muhammad Dilshad, renowned writer Afshan Abbasi, and a large number of teachers from public and private institutions. In his address, Vice Chancellor of Allama Iqbal Open University, Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood, said that teachers are the torchbearers of society whose names and deeds remain alive long after they are gone. \"It is a great honor for me that on World Teachers' Day, the Nazriya Pakistan Council provided me, as a lifelong student, the opportunity to participate in such a beautiful event dedicated to teachers and students,\" he said with gratitude. He further stated that the selfless services of teachers deserve special appreciation, as their contribution to shaping the future of the nation's children is truly commendable. Dr. Mahmood noted that the current state of respect for teachers is not as bleak as often perceived. \"Our religion and society have placed the teacher's status equal to that of parents. It now depends on me, as a teacher, to prove myself worthy of that status,\" he remarked. In his presidential address, NPC Chairman Mian Muhammad Javed paid tribute to teachers, saying that despite numerous challenges, they continue to play a vital role in building the nation's future. He urged the government to focus on educating over 20 million out-of-school children across the country. He added that achieving this goal requires substantial financial resources, emphasizing that philanthropists and private organizations should also come forward to support educational initiatives. Guest of Honour and noted scholar, former Ambassador Afrasiab Mehdi Hashmi, said that the Holy Qur'an commands believers to read, reflect, understand, and act. He added that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) stated that all creatures in the heavens and on earth pray for the forgiveness of those who spread knowledge. \"One can imagine how exalted the status of a teacher is,\" he remarked. Former Senator and Chairperson of Taleem Network Pakistan, Razina Alam Khan, said it was an honour that \"Ustad-ul-Asatiza\" (Teacher of Teachers), Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood, graced the ceremony as a Chief Guest and he would also distribute certificates of appreciation among teachers from various public and private schools and madaris in Islamabad and surrounding areas, for their outstanding performance. Earlier, senior members of NPC's Executive Council-including former Ambassador Salahuddin Chaudhry, education experts Dr. Muhammad Saleem, Dr. Muhammad Afzal Babar, Nargis Nasir, and Hameed Qaiser-also addressed the gathering. At the conclusion, the distinguished guests distributed certificates among the 35 teachers who had shown exceptional performance.",
