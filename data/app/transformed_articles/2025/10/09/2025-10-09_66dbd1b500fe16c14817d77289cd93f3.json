    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 09 (APP):Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Thursday that Pakistan would continue its fight against terrorism until the last terrorist was eliminated. Speaking in the National Assembly, he expressed solidarity with the Armed Forces and paid tribute to the officers and soldiers who laid down their lives in recent operations. He said the House had offered Fateha for the martyrs at the start of the session. He informed the House that the federal cabinet, in a unanimous decision, had also honoured the sacrifices of the Armed Forces and saluted those who gave their lives for the nation. \"The sacrifices of these martyrs are immortal. The courage and resolve of every bereaved family are everlasting,\" he said, adding that the families drew solace and pride from their loved ones' devotion to the country. Dr. Tariq Fazal said it was decided to suspend the National Assembly's routine proceedings to express solidarity with the Pakistan Armed Forces and other security agencies, and to send a clear message of unity. \"In the war against terrorism, we stand united with our Armed Forces. We are of one voice and one spirit,\" he said. He urged all stakeholders to fulfil their responsibilities in this struggle and said Pakistan wished to convey to neighbouring countries that it stood as a champion of peace and always advocated peaceful coexistence. He said that Pakistan's effective response to Indian aggression had been acknowledged globally, adding that the consensus in the House reflected the nation's firm support for the Armed Forces and all institutions engaged in the fight against terrorism. Later, the Minister moved a motion to suspend the routine proceedings of the House, which the members unanimously approved.",
