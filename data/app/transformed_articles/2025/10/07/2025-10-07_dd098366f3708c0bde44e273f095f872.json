    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP): Following continuous rainfall, the water level in Rawal Dam rose sharply on Tuesday, prompting the district administration to open the spillways to maintain safe water discharge levels. According to the district administration, the recent spell of rain caused a significant increase in the dam's water level, which reached 1,752 feet. In response, authorities opened the spillways to regulate the flow and prevent overflow risks. A spokesperson for the administration said that water discharge would continue as per the prescribed limits to ensure controlled release from the reservoir. The administration has directed all relevant departments to remain on alert and monitor the situation closely. Citizens have been advised to stay away from low-lying areas near the dam and downstream regions as a precautionary measure. The administration urged residents to report any emergency situation immediately to the district control room. The decision to open the spillways is part of standard safety measures taken during high rainfall to manage the rising water level effectively and safeguard nearby areas.",
