He expressed deep solidarity with the oppressed Palestinian people and paid rich tribute to their unwavering courage and resilience in the face of Israeli barbarism. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq stated that Israel has written the darkest chapter of cruelty and tyranny against the Palestinian people. \"Israel's hands are stained with the blood of over seventy thousand innocent Palestinians,\" he said, adding that Israel's actions during the past two years represent gross violations of international law and human rights. He remarked that Israeli terrorist acts are contrary to modern global norms and the conscience of humanity. \"History will never forget the brutal atrocities committed by Israel against the Palestinian people,\" the Speaker added. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said that Israel has continuously defied the decisions of the International Court of Justice and the United Nations Security Council.
