    "article_body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (APP): The International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM) on Tuesday conferred an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Leadership and Governance on Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif in recognition of his outstanding leadership and contributions to nation-building. The conferment of the honorary degree took place at a Special Convocation Ceremony held at the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization of IIUM's Kuala Lumpur Campus, which was officiated by the university's Constitutional Head, Tengku Ampuan Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah. At the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart, Prime Minister Shehbaz is on a three-day official visit to Malaysia, wherein he met Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and held delegation-level talks, besides addressing an investment conference. In his acceptance address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described the conferment as a \"great privilege and honor,\" emphasizing his delight in being associated with IIUM, an institution renowned for championing the integration of knowledge, faith, and ethics. Recalling his stints as Punjab Chief Minister, he highlighted his four-decade-long service as a \"public servant\" and noted that, now as the prime minister, he remained committed to serving the nation with sincerity and unwavering commitment. Acknowledging the honor with \"heartfelt gratitude,\" he expressed the hope that his presence at IIUM would further strengthen academic partnerships and collaboration between the university and Pakistan's leading institutions of higher learning. The prime minister said that leadership was a sacred trust which should be exercised with honesty, sincerity, justice, and transparent accountability. Highlighting the challenges facing the Muslim Ummah, he called for unity, compassion, and moral integrity and stressed the need to hold steadfastly to Islamic values and ethics to reclaim their rightful place in the comity of nations. He called Pakistan's youthful population a blessing and underscored the responsibility to provide them with platforms to serve suffering humanity with compassion and commitment. In her address, Tunku Azizah said that for over four decades, Shehbaz Sharif had demonstrated visionary leadership, discipline, and compassion, dedicated to transforming lives and uplifting communities through advancements in education, healthcare, and opportunity creation. \"His initiatives, such as the Punjab Education Endowment Fund, have opened the doors of higher learning to thousands who might never have dreamed of university education. That is leadership that touches hearts and transforms futures... At a time when the world often prizes image over integrity, His Excellency (Shehbaz Sharif) reminds us that good governance is about sincerity, service, and steadfastness,\" she said. Commending Pakistan's longstanding friendship with Malaysia, she said the bilateral ties had further strengthened under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. \"Today, our Pakistani students, academics, and alumni continue to enrich the university and uphold our shared mission of serving the Ummah. This conferment is more than a recognition of achievement. It is a celebration of the values we hold dear: justice, service, and excellence guided by faith,\" she added. The ceremony was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, SAPM Tariq Fatemi, Malaysia's Communication Minister Fahmi Fadzil, Higher Education Minister Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, IIUM President Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Hussain, IIUM Rector Prof Emeritus Datuk Dr Osman Bakar, and the High Commissioner of Pakistan to Malaysia, Syed Ahsan Raza Shah. Later, in his social media post on X, the prime minister accepted the honour as symbol of deep rooted intellectual and cultural connection. \"During my just concluded official visit to Malaysia, it was a truly humbling experience to be recognized with an honorary degree of Doctor of leadership and governance by Queen of the state of Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah of Malaysia. With great humility, I accepted this honour on behalf of the people of Pakistan as a symbol of the deep rooted intellectual and cultural connection as well as people to people ties between Pakistan and Malaysia,\" he added.",
