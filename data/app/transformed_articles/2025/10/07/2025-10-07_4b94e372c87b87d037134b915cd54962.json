The launch ceremony was addressed by Chairman PMYP Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, who emphasized that the government is actively promoting the concept of a digital economy to equip young Pakistanis for the future. He said that the initiative is part of a broader vision to build a knowledge-based economy driven by innovation and technology. Highlighting the key features of the initiative, Rana Mashhood announced the introduction of the Digital Wallet as a revolutionary step designed to provide ease and financial convenience to overseas Pakistanis.

He further explained that up to one million dollars can be legally transferred through this platform, marking a significant milestone in Pakistan's journey toward financial digitization.

The Chairman noted that overseas Pakistanis can now contribute more effectively to the country's development through this secure and efficient system. He added that youth are Pakistan's most valuable asset, and the government is determined to make the country's future bright by creating opportunities that combine technology, innovation, and global collaboration.
