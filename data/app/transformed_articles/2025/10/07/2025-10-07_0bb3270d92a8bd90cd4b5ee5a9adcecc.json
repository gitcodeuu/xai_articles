    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP):An eight-member larger bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan on Monday, heard petitions challenging the 26th Constitutional Amendment and approved the plea for live streaming of the proceedings. The next hearing will be held on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Shahid Jameel, counsel for Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, appeared before the bench and contended that objections had been raised to his petition regarding the constitution of a full court. He said a chamber appeal had already been filed against those objections and requested that the court first decide the appeal. He further submitted that similar objections had been raised to the composition of the present bench and urged the court to hear his plea along with the other related petitions. After brief consultation, the bench directed that the petition be numbered accordingly. Subsequently, Advocate Khawaja Hussain Ahmed, representing former Chief Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja, approached the rostrum and requested permission for live streaming of the proceedings. Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan observed that notices had already been issued on both applications, adding that the bench had decided that if any objection was raised regarding the composition of the bench, another bench would hear those objections. However, if no objection remained, the same bench would proceed to hear the matter of live streaming. He further remarked that the court would first decide the petition regarding the constitution of a full court, after which it would take up the issue of live streaming. At this point, Advocate Khawaja Hussain Ahmed said the entire nation wanted to see what was happening inside the courtroom. Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed that unfortunately, in Pakistan, every facility was often misused. \"We wanted to educate people through live streaming, but instead, we ourselves became exposed through it,\" he remarked. Additional Attorney General Aamir Rehman then appeared before the court. Justice Ayesha Malik inquired about the government's stance on live streaming, asking whether it supported or opposed the idea. AAG Rehman replied that live streaming fell under the administrative domain. To this, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar remarked: \"That means the government will accept whatever decision the bench makes on the matter.\" Later, the eight-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan approved the request for live streaming and adjourned the hearing till 11:30am on Wednesday.",
