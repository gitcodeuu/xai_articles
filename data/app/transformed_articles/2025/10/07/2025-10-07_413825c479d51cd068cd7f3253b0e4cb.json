    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 07 (APP):The Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) on Tuesday discussed avenues to attract foreign investment and expand partnership opportunities in key development projects aimed at transforming Islamabad into a global city. The meeting, held at the CDA Headquarters, was chaired by CDA Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa and attended by Managing Director OPF Mohammad Afzaal Bhatti along with a delegation of overseas investors. Chairman Randhawa said Islamabad offers excellent opportunities for international investors and emphasized that joint venture models are being promoted to attract foreign participation in the city's infrastructure, tourism, and real estate sectors. \"CDA is providing all possible facilitation to investors,\" Randhawa said. \"Work is ongoing on multiple projects, particularly in the hotel and hospitality industry, to enhance Islamabad's profile as a modern and vibrant capital.\" He added that efforts are also underway to develop state-of-the-art sports facilities, including a feasibility study for an Olympic Village, which would position Islamabad as an international sports destination. The overseas investors' delegation expressed keen interest in investment opportunities, particularly within the hospitality and tourism sectors. Both sides agreed to continue consultations to identify the most viable and mutually beneficial projects for collaboration. Randhawa reaffirmed CDA's commitment to fostering partnerships that drive sustainable urban growth. \"All these projects will not only benefit investors and the CDA but will also contribute to the overall development of the capital,\" he said. \"CDA prioritizes investor partnerships and is ready to extend full cooperation.\" Senior CDA officials, including Member Planning and Design Dr. Khalid Hafiz, Member Environment Esfandyar Baloch, and Directors General of Building & Housing Control and Resource, also participated.",
