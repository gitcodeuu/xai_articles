    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP): Pakistan and Ethiopia have agreed to enhance cooperation in skill development to prepare a trained workforce for the progress of both nations. The understanding was reached during a meeting between Dr. Jemal Beker Abdula, Ambassador and Special Envoy of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and Salik Hussain, Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development. During the meeting, Dr. Jemal Beker briefed the minister on Ethiopia's ongoing economic reforms aimed at promoting macroeconomic stability, supporting private sector investment, and improving public service delivery. He said Ethiopia is focusing on developing modern skills among its youth, including coding, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and computing, to boost their productivity and employment opportunities. The Ethiopian envoy proposed joint initiatives between the two countries to provide technical and digital training for young people, enabling them to contribute effectively to national growth. He also spoke about the significant contribution of the Ethiopian diaspora to the country's economy. Dr. Jemal Beker mentioned the government's \"Back to Origins\" program, which invites second-generation Ethiopians living abroad to reconnect with their heritage and take part in Ethiopia's development efforts. Minister Salik Hussain appreciated the proposal for cooperation and reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to expanding its partnership with Ethiopia in human resource development. He said both countries share similar goals in promoting education, skill enhancement, and employment opportunities for youth. The minister acknowledged the progress Ethiopia has made under the leadership of Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed and praised Ambassador Beker's role in strengthening bilateral relations. Both sides expressed confidence that closer collaboration in training and skill development will help create employment opportunities, promote innovation, and strengthen ties between Ethiopia and Pakistan.",
