    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 07 (APP):Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Pakistan's military development strategy has always focused on the induction of effective and efficient platforms, as well as indigenously developed Pakistani technology. In an interview with the foreign magazine Bloomberg, he said, \"We remain open to acquiring all kinds of technology-whether indigenous, Eastern, or Western.\" He said that Pakistan is not part of any arms race with India and has never attempted to manipulate or conceal facts and figures. Ahmed Sharif said that India failed to shoot down any Pakistani aircraft during the recent Marka-e-Haq operation. The DG ISPR also commended the effective performance of Pakistani weapon systems, including Chinese platforms integrated into the Pakistan Armed Forces during Marka-e-Haq. A week earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump had also confirmed that seven Indian aircraft were downed, Bloomberg reported. In its report, Bloomberg stated that Pakistan's Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets shot down several Indian Air Force aircraft, including Rafales, during the recent Marka-e-Haq operation. In August, Pakistan announced the induction of the Z-10ME attack helicopter into its arsenal, Bloomberg reported. The magazine said that Pakistan uses both Chinese weapons and U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets.",
