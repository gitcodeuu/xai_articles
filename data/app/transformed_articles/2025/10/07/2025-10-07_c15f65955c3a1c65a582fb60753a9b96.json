    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 07 (APP):The National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) has intensified its initiatives to promote women's economic participation and gender equality in Pakistan through policy reforms, research, and partnerships with government, private sector, and international organizations. The NCSW monitors the implementation of gender equality measures and advises federal and provincial authorities on actions required to improve the status of women in the country. In recent months, the NCSW has accelerated its focus on evidence-based policy development and inter-agency cooperation. In partnership with UNFPA, UN Women, Group Development Pakistan, and the Embassy of the Netherlands, the Commission is preparing Pakistan's first National Gender Parity Report, scheduled for release in early 2026. The report aims to consolidate national-level gender data to assess progress in areas such as education, employment, political participation, and access to justice. Earlier this year, the NCSW joined hands with the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) to promote women's economic and social empowerment, focusing on poverty reduction, digital inclusion, entrepreneurship, and climate resilience. The partnership is designed to provide women with new opportunities in small businesses, social enterprises, and technology based initiatives. The Commission has also taken major steps toward addressing the digital gender divide. A collaborative report titled \"Digitalization and Women in Pakistan\" was developed in coordination with UNDP, UN Women, and private sector partners. This study highlights the barriers women face in accessing digital platforms and outlines strategies for increasing their digital skills and participation in the tech economy. NCSW has also partnered with the National Incubation Centre to train home-based workers, survivors of violence, and women with disabilities in entrepreneurship and e-commerce. In addition, the Commission recently signed an agreement with the Oil & Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) to promote gender diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate workplaces. It has also conducted regional training workshops in Gilgit-Baltistan and other provinces to strengthen the capacity of Women Development Departments in designing and implementing effective women's empowerment programmes. However, the Commission continues to face challenges, including limited data coordination among provinces, weak implementation of gender policies, and a lack of awareness among women about their rights and available opportunities. Funding and resource constraints also affect the scale and pace of implementation across regions, the report revealed.",
