    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 07 (APP):Minister of State for Federal Education and Professional Training Wajiha Qamar has pledged full implementation of the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC)'s new recommendations aimed at upgrading Pakistan's technical and vocational sector to global standards. Speaking at the conclusion of a two-day International Dialogue organized by NAVTTC, Wajiha Qamar said the proposed reforms will help align Pakistan's Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system with international benchmarks, strengthen industrial linkages, and create more opportunities for youth employment. \"We will enforce these recommendations to help Pakistan move on the path of progress,\" she said. \"These reforms will bring real change in our workshops, industries, and technical institutions.\" The state minister praised NAVTTC Chairperson Gulmina Bilal for leading the process and acknowledged the support of international partners, including the European Union, British Council, and German Cooperation, in developing the recommendations. Emphasizing the strategic importance of the TVET sector, Wajiha Qamar said it has become the backbone of Pakistan's economic growth, yet remains underutilized. \"Nearly 64% of our population is under 30, but less than 8% of our youth are enrolled in formal TVET programs,\" she noted. \"Each year, about 2 million young Pakistanis enter the labor market, but only a fraction possess industry-relevant skills. Without equipping them with technical expertise, sustainable economic progress cannot be achieved.\" The minister underlined that the government is committed to ensuring harassment-free workplaces, modern curricula, and green economy initiatives in all technical and vocational institutions. She said implementation of NAVTTC's recommendations will enhance global recognition of Pakistani skills and qualifications, helping the country tap into international employment markets. International delegates at the dialogue - including EU Head of Delegation Geroen Willems and German Ambassador Ina Lepel - praised Pakistan's renewed focus on technical education, commending the government's commitment under Wajiha Qamar's leadership to turn policy discussions into actionable reforms. NAVTTC Chairperson Gulmina Bilal said the 24 recommendations were developed with consensus from all stakeholders, aiming to create a globally competitive skilled workforce. The dialogue also called for better coordination between federal and provincial bodies through legislative measures to ensure effective implementation of TVET reforms. Wajiha Qamar concluded with consistent policy action and international collaboration, Pakistan's technical education system can become a key driver of economic empowerment, youth employment, and sustainable development.",
