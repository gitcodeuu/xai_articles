The newly established Federal Working Group will serve as a dedicated platform for Members of Parliament to deliberate on issues related to religious minorities and to advance inclusive legislative and policy reforms that promote equality, tolerance, and social cohesion. The inaugural meeting was attended by Members of the National Assembly and Senate and representatives from civil society, who came together to initiate a coordinated federal agenda for the protection and promotion of minority rights. In his presentation, Shafique Chaudhry, Executive Director of PCHR, highlighted that Pakistan's religious minorities comprising around 3.6% of the national population (Census 2023). \"Human rights are the prerequisite of every democracy; they are in fact building blocks,\"he remarked. He shared that Rights and justice Minorities Network (RJNM) has been introduced at the district level. Institutional mechanisms will be formulated. Speaking at the occasion, Senator Danesh Kumar emphasized that the foundation of minority rights in Pakistan lies in Quaid-e-Azam's August 11 speech, which affirmed freedom of religion and separation of faith from the affairs of the State. He highlighted that the Constitution guarantees equality and safeguards for all citizens through various articles, including 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 33, 36, 37, 38, 51, 59, and 227. He stressed the need to revive Pakistan's rich Sufi traditions of tolerance and interfaith harmony to strengthen social cohesion and national unity. The members of the Working Group noted that every political party has established a minority wing representing communities at both provincial and national levels. However, they emphasized the need to continue engaging and sensitizing political parties to address minorities problems. Riaz Fatyana highlighted that Islam teaches equality and compassion, as reflected in the title Rahmatul-lil-Alameen mercy for all mankind. He noted that the Last Sermon of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) upholds the principle of equality among all human beings. He said that members of minority communities have played a vital role in Pakistan's development and emphasized that parliamentarians must work together to ensure the full realization of equality as guaranteed by the Constitution of Pakistan. He emphasized that lawmakers have both a constitutional and moral duty to promote inclusive legislation and safeguard the rights and dignity of all citizens, irrespective of their faith. A key highlight of the discussion was the National Commission for Minorities Rights (NCMR) Bill, recently passed by Parliament and currently under review following its return by the President. Participants emphasized that the NCMR, is important, hence all parties should join hands to get it passed in the joint session as early as possible. This enactment will play a pivotal role in institutionalizing minority rights protection and strengthening accountability mechanisms across the country.
