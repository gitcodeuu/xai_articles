    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP):Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal (PBM) and National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Tuesday to formally recognize and support Women Empowerment Centres (WECs) in delivering skill-based training to women and facilitating their transition into entrepreneurship. Senator Shaheen Khalid Butt, Managing Director of PBM, and Muhammad Amir Jan, Executive Director of NAVTTC, formally signed the MoU. This strategic partnership delivers certified vocational training for women, equipping them with in-demand skills to boost sustainable livelihoods and drive inclusive workforce development across Pakistan. This MoU represents a pivotal milestone for PBM's WECs, which currently train women in high-demand skills such as dressmaking, information technology, and beautician courses. For the first time, WEC graduates will receive accredited certificates, significantly boosting their employability and entrepreneurial prospects. PBM is also expanding its curriculum to include cutting-edge courses aligned with market trends, ensuring women are equipped to thrive in today's dynamic economy. The initiative has ignited enthusiasm among trainees, educators, and communities across Pakistan, including in Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and former FATA. With WECs established in nearly every district, PBM is empowering women to drive sustainable change and contribute economically to their households. The program's impact is already evident, with trainees expressing optimism about new opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship. Beyond WECs, PBM remains committed to uplifting marginalized communities through initiatives like schools for child labor rehabilitation, Pakistan Sweet Homes for orphans, shelter homes, Great Homes for senior citizens, and individual financial assistance programs supporting medical care, education, and empowerment for widows and persons with disabilities. This MoU marks a bold step toward a brighter, more inclusive future, empowering Pakistan's women with the skills and opportunities to shape their destinies and contribute to national progress. Captain Senator Shaheen Khalid Butt, Managing Director of PBM, described the MoU as a cornerstone of PBM's vision to transform WECs into a flagship initiative for inclusive, gender-focused development. \"Our mission is to empower women not just with skills but with tangible opportunities for self-reliance and economic contribution,\" he said. \"Through free training, daily stipends, and practical resources, we are building a future where women can break the cycle of poverty and become financial pillars for their families.\" Since assuming leadership, MD PBM has driven a series of transformative reforms under Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif's \"Uraan Pakistan\" National Economic Transformation Plan (2024-2029). With a sharp focus on women's development and alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Shaheen Butt has spearheaded efforts to restructure PBM, positioning it as a beacon of inclusive growth. He expressed deep gratitude to NAVTTC's Chairperson Ms. Gulmina Bilal Ahmad and Executive Director Muhammad Amir Jan for their unwavering support, while commending Professor Dr. Zeeshan Danish and Dr. Zafar Khan Safdar for their pivotal roles in achieving accreditation milestones. Professor Dr. Zeeshan Danish, Director General of Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal (PBM), delivered a detailed briefing on the organization's operations, highlighting that over 18,000 students are currently enrolled across 165 Women Empowerment Centres (WECs) nationwide, equipping over 12,372 women across Pakistan with nationally and internationally recognized vocational certifications, unlocking new pathways to employment, entrepreneurship, and financial independence. More than 900 faculty members are actively engaged in delivering diverse skill development courses tailored for women. Dr. Zafar Sardar, a senior officer of PBM added that enrolled students receive a daily stipend of Rs. 100, and upon successful completion of their training, each student is awarded Rs. 18,000. Executive Director NAVTTC, Muhammad Amir Jan, stated that NAVTTC provides skill-based training to over 100,000 youth annually through partnerships with both private and public institutions. NAVTTC has been tasked with building strong connections with over 300 federally governed institutes that are not yet linked to the commission. Over the next six months, these institutes will be registered, their curricula evaluated, training programs launched, and recommendations proposed for further enhancement. Muhammad Amir Jan stated that NAVTTC will support PBM in key areas such as IT training, teacher development, and curriculum enhancement for Women Empowerment Centres (WECs). He added that NAVTTC will also promote entrepreneurship to ensure more effective use of public funds, expressing hope that these efforts will contribute to improving the employment rate. The signing ceremony was attended by senior dignitaries from both organizations. NAVTTC's delegation was led by Executive Director Muhammad Amir Jan, joined by Zafar Haider, Muhammad Yasir, Ms. Amina Gilani, Ms. Fatima Gilani, Hafiz Awais, and Maj. Adnan. Representing PBM were Managing Director Captain Senator Shaheen Khalid Butt, Director General (Projects) Professor Dr. Zeeshan Danish, Director Education Dr. Zafar Khan Safdar, and all PBM Head Office directors, marking a unified commitment to this transformative initiative.",
