    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP):The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (SZABIST) formalized a strategic collaboration to advance research, innovation and academic linkages between the two leading institutions of higher education in Pakistan. The initiative aimed to promote joint research projects, academic programs and evidence-based policy dialogues that contribute to Pakistan's sustainable development and institutional growth. This collaboration marked a significant step toward bridging the gap between academic research and policymaking, fostering a culture of inquiry-driven solutions to national and sub-national challenges. A high-level delegation from SZABIST, led by Shahnaz Wazir Ali, former advisor to the Prime Minister and President SZABIST and Khusro Pervaiz Khan, Head of SZABIST Islamabad Campus, visited PIDE to discuss avenues of cooperation. The delegation was warmly received by Dr Nadeem Javaid , Vice Chancellor PIDE, along with senior leadership including Dr Faheem Jehangir (Dean, Policy), Dr Karim Khan (Dean, Academics) and Dr Shujaat Farooq (Dean, Research). During the meeting, the two institutions exchanged ideas on strengthening inter-university collaboration and research synergy in key policy domains such as economic governance, human development, social protection and innovation ecosystems. The PIDE leadership shared insights into its expanding research landscape, highlighting flagship initiatives such as RASTA - the PIDE & Planning Commission Competitive Research Grants Program, which empowers academics across Pakistan to engage in policy-relevant research. The SZABIST team appreciated PIDE's intellectual leadership and emphasized the importance of connecting academic institutions nationwide through knowledge partnerships. They proposed facilitation and collaboration in field research, data collection and student engagements through SZABIST's widespread network of campuses and experts. Both sides also discussed the potential for faculty and student exchange programs, joint seminars and conferences and collaborative publications aimed at disseminating research that informs evidence-based policymaking. Concluding the meeting, the leadership from both esteemed institutions reaffirmed their commitment to building a long-term, sustainable partnership grounded in academic excellence, mutual respect, and shared vision.",
