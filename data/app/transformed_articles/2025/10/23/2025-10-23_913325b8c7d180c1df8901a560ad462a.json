    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 23 (APP):The Young Parliamentarians Forum (YPF), under the National Assembly Secretariat, organized a dynamic Youth Kachehri in NA-73, Daska, on Wednesday, led by MNA Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, President YPF. The event brought together students, educators, and government officials to engage in policy dialogue, youth empowerment, and participatory governance, marking a major step in connecting young citizens with their elected representatives and shaping Pakistan's future youth development framework. The Youth Kachehri witnessed enthusiastic participation from faculty and students of leading educational institutions including Kips College, Aspire College, Punjab College, Superior College, NIMS College, Sialkot Medical College, Apex College, Al Fanan College, Supreme College, Women's College, Boys College Mundake, and Jamke. The session served as a vibrant platform where students voiced ideas, shared challenges, and directly interacted with decision-makers. In her address, Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar emphasized the vital role of youth in strengthening democracy and bridging the communication gap between the public and policymakers. She highlighted that such forums help institutionalize youth participation in governance, ensuring that their voices contribute directly to legislative planning and community development. Prominent speakers included Assistant Commissioner Ms Sadia Jaffer, CSS 2024 Topper Mr Shafay Ijaz, District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Mr Irfan Yakub, Director Colleges Gujranwala Dr Amanullah Rathore, and Superintendent Police Investigations Raja Haseeb, who led thought-provoking sessions on education reform, governance, public safety, and youth leadership. The event also featured an Open Q&A and Grievance Hearing chaired by Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, providing students an opportunity to present concerns and propose actionable solutions. Discussions covered women's empowerment, law and order awareness, career development, and public service orientation, giving youth a sense of ownership in shaping community-driven progress. Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar announced that the Youth Kachehri model will be institutionalized under YPF to ensure consistent engagement between parliamentarians and youth nationwide. She reaffirmed YPF's dedication to fostering participatory democracy, transparency, and youth-centered policy formation. \"This dialogue is the heartbeat of inclusive governance,\" she said. \"We are committed to turning the ideas of young Pakistanis into real policies that reflect their aspirations, concerns, and creative vision for the nation.\" The initiative stands as a testament to YPF's mission of empowering young citizens, strengthening trust between representatives and constituents, and building a collaborative democratic culture that prioritizes youth inclusion in decision-making at every level.",
