The festival aimed to promote methods for reducing agricultural costs, encouraging balanced use of fertilizers, making farming more profitable, and strengthening academia-industry linkages. The event was jointly inaugurated by Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman and former MNA Raja Muhammad Javed Ikhlas.

Addressing the festival, Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman emphasized the urgent need for Pakistan to take concrete steps in agriculture, noting that the world has advanced significantly in this field while Pakistan still relies on traditional farming methods. \"Precision agriculture and smart IoT technologies are the future of farming\", he highlighted and also pointed out the unique fertile land of the Potohar region. He urged farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices to maximize productivity and increase agricultural output. Regarding the Punjab government's agricultural reforms program, he assured that Arid Agriculture University is ready to provide full support, adding that the program will significantly contribute to boosting agricultural exports. Former MNA Raja Muhammad Javed Ikhlas, in his address, commended the efforts of Arid Agriculture University and stressed the need for farmers to move beyond traditional methods and embrace modern agriculture.

Describing the event as a beacon of hope, he expressed optimism about Pakistan's agricultural future, predicting that the country would soon join the ranks of developed nations exporting agricultural commodities. He also lauded the invaluable contributions of Arid Agriculture University, particularly in the Pothohar region, which he said would always be remembered.
