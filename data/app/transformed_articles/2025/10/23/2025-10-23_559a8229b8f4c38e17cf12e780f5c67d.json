    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 23 (APP):The Federal Government on Thursday approved to declare the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) a proscribed organization under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The decision was taken during a federal cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif here. In the meeting, the Ministry of Interior presented a summary to the Cabinet following a request from the Government of Punjab. Senior officials from the Punjab Government also joined the meeting via video link. The cabinet was briefed on the TLP's violent and terrorist activities across the country. The officials informed the meeting that since its establishment in 2016, the group has been involved in multiple incidents of unrest and violence, causing significant disruption and loss of life. It was also recalled that in 2021, the then government had imposed a ban on TLP, which was later lifted after six months on the assurance that the organization would refrain from any violent or disruptive activities in the future. However, the cabinet was informed that TLP has violated those assurances by again resorting to the acts of violence and incitement. The briefing highlighted that in the past, several security personnel and innocent bystanders lost their lives during TLP's violent protests and rallies. After reviewing the detailed briefing and the recommendations from the Government of Punjab, the federal cabinet unanimously viewed that the TLP has been actively engaged in terrorism and violent activities, consequently, declaring it a proscribed organization under the Anti-Terrorism Act.",
