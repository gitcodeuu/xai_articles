    "article_body": "SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Oct 13 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Monday, arrived here in Egypt, on a special invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to attend the Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit and the signing ceremony of the peace agreement aimed at ending the prevailing grave situation in Gaza. Egyptian Youth and Sports Minister Dr Ashraf Sobhy warmly received the prime minister at Sharm-El-Sheikh Airport. Pakistan's ambassador to Egypt Aamir Shouket and high diplomatic officials from Pakistan and Egypt were also present on the occasion. The prime minister was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar as part of the official delegation. During the visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will attend the signing ceremony of the Gaza Peace Agreement, which will also be attended by President Donald Trump, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and other prominent world leaders. Meanwhile in his post on X, the prime minister said \"Alhamdolillah, arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh this morning to attend the signing ceremony of the landmark Gaza peace plan - a crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East\". \"Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump's outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment. It took his single minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,\" he said. The prime minister said today's ceremony marks the closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again. \"The brave and resilient Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city,\" he added.",
