In a statement, the minister said Pakistan desired peace in the region and always pursued a policy of good-neighbourly relations, but it possessed full capability to defend every inch of its territory. \"Pakistan is a peace-loving country, but any aggression against our sovereignty will be responded to with full strength,\" Ahsan Iqbal asserted. He said the entire nation stood shoulder to shoulder with its armed forces in safeguarding the country's frontiers and ensuring national security.",
