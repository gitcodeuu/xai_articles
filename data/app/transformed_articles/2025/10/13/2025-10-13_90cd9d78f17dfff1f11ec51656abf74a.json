    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP):The Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) has announced that the opening of \"Aatish\", an exhibition of ceramic works by distinguished artist Nabahat Lotia, has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. The exhibition, which was originally scheduled to open on October 14 (Tuesday).at the Gallery No. 3, National Art Gallery, PNCA was to be inaugurated by renowned visual artist Mr. Jamal Shah. The new date for the opening will be announced soon. Curated by Mariam Ahmed, \"Aatish\" highlights the transformative power of clay and fire-central themes in Nabahat Lotia's decades-long artistic journey. The exhibition will feature an exceptional collection of ceramic works that reflect her deep connection with nature and mastery of form and texture. Nabahat Lotia draws profound inspiration from nature, which she describes as the guiding force behind her creative journey. With over 30 years of experience and 18 solo shows, she has collaborated with traditional potters across Pakistan, working to preserve and evolve local pottery practices. Her recent book, \"Pottery Traditions of Pakistan,\" documents this rich journey and reflects her lifelong commitment to cultural heritage. Lotia has participated in numerous residencies and workshops, taught pottery techniques, and exhibited her work internationally including in Pakistan, Bali, Toronto, New York, Turkey, and Sri Lanka. \"Nature is my inspiration, and my work has always been in harmony with it\", Nabahat Lotia. Said. The final results of \"Aatish\" are a testament to the extraordinary transformations catalyzed by fire, capturing both the fragility and strength of the creative process. PNCA has expressed its regret for the postponement and any inconvenience caused to visitors and art enthusiasts, urging them to stay connected with PNCA or contact nag.vadevents@gmail.com for further updates.",
