    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP): Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Vice President and Senator Sherry Rehman has called for a unified national response to combat breast cancer, emphasizing the urgent need for early detection, treatment accessibility, and awareness at all levels. In her message on World Breast Cancer Awareness Day, Senator Rehman said that breast cancer has become the most prevalent disease among Pakistani women. \"One in every nine women in Pakistan is at risk of developing breast cancer during her lifetime,\" she stated, highlighting the gravity of the situation. She expressed grave concern over the increasing mortality rate, noting that more than one hundred women lose their lives daily to breast cancer in Pakistan. \"Delayed diagnosis remains one of the major causes of preventable deaths,\" she said. Senator Rehman pointed out that breast cancer appears at a relatively younger age among Pakistani women and stressed that misconceptions related to modesty and social taboos often discourage women from seeking timely medical attention. She further highlighted the lack of psychological support for women who undergo mastectomy, adding, \"It is vital to provide not only medical treatment but also mental health and emotional assistance to women battling this disease.\" Calling for concrete measures beyond symbolic awareness, Senator Rehman stated, \"Awareness alone is not sufficient. There is a pressing need to ensure access to quality screening and treatment facilities nationwide. Symbolic gestures must translate into practical healthcare reforms.\" Citing international examples, she noted that in countries where early detection programs are widely implemented, over 90 percent of women recover fully. \"Pakistan too can achieve similar results if screening and treatment facilities are made accessible and affordable,\" she emphasized. Senator Sherry Rehman concluded by urging all stakeholders to join hands in addressing this national health challenge. \"These are not mere statistics - they represent human lives and families. The fight against breast cancer requires collective, sustained, and practical action at the national level,\" she said.",
