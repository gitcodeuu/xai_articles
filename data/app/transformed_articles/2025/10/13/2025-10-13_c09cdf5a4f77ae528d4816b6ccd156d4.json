    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP):The Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme, led by the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) and its partner organizations, has officially launched the country's fourth national polio vaccination drive of 2025 across 159 districts. During this week-long campaign, more than 45 million children under the age of five will receive polio drops to protect them from lifelong paralysis. In addition to the polio vaccine, children will also be given Vitamin A supplements to strengthen their immunity. Since the launch of the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme in 1994, nationwide door-to-door vaccination campaigns have led to a 99.6% reduction in annual polio cases, dropping from 20,000 cases per year to 74 in 2024. So far this year, 29 cases have been reported. More than 400,000 trained polio workers have been mobilized across the country to reach every household and vaccinate children. The campaign will continue from October 13 to 19 in most parts of the country, while in seven districts of South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it will be conducted from October 20 to 23. This is the fourth national polio campaign of 2025, targeting over 23 million children in Punjab, 10.6 million in Sindh, 7.2 million in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 2.6 million in Balochistan, 760,000 in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, 228,000 in Gilgit-Baltistan, and 460,000 in Islamabad. The campaign comes at a crucial time as the country faces an uptick in polio virus transmission, with 29 children affected so far this year. Recent floods have damaged sanitation systems, displaced communities, and disrupted healthcare services, increasing the risk of virus spread. The nationwide effort reflects the Government of Pakistan's unwavering commitment to protecting every child and fulfilling national and global promises for a polio-free future. Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Ms. Ayesha Raza Farooq, stated, \"While the overall presence of the virus has declined compared to last year, our mission is not yet complete.\" She said, \"The risk of transmission remains high, especially after the recent floods. Protecting children from polio is our shared responsibility.\" She said, \"I urge all parents to open their doors to polio workers and ensure that their children receive these life-saving drops.\"",
