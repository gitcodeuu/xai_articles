    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP): Islamabad's district administration on Monday clarified that no roads in the federal capital have been closed and routine life continues as usual across the city. In an official statement, the administration said that traffic flow had slowed at a few points due to temporary barriers placed for public safety, but movement remained open throughout the city. It added that Islamabad Traffic Police teams were actively managing traffic to ensure smooth flow on all major routes. The administration confirmed that commercial and business activities in all sectors were fully operational and that daily life remained unaffected. It further stated that no protest or public gathering was taking place in any part of Islamabad. Officials said that strict action would be taken immediately in case of any unlawful protest or demonstration, as Section 144 is currently in effect across the capital, prohibiting all such activities. The administration also urged citizens to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and refrain from participating in any illegal gatherings or disruptive activities. The district administration assured residents that the situation in Islamabad remained peaceful and that all departments, including police and field teams, were alert to maintain public order.",
