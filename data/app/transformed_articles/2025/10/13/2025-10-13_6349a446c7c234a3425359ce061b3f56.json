    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, October 13 (APP):Central Asia's transformation into a region of peace, dialogue and cooperation will take center stage at the first-ever Fergana Peace Forum, scheduled to be held on October 15-16 at Fergana State University in Uzbekistan. Dr Abror Yusupov, PhD in Political Science and Deputy Director of the Center for Analysis of Democratic Processes, in an exclusive talk on Monday, said the region's steady shift from geopolitical turbulence to an era of \"Experts often quote the Latin phrase si vis pacem, para bellum - 'if you want peace, prepare for war.' Yet, the Central Asian experience demonstrates the opposite: peace can be achieved through dialogue, good neighbourliness, and cooperation,\" Dr Yusupov said. He said over the past decade, Central Asia's GDP has grown more than 6% annually, double the global average, driven by political stability, economic reforms, and strengthened regional ties. The region's leaders have prioritized the resolution of border disputes and the creation of a common economic space, supported by cultural and humanitarian initiatives that reinforce a spirit of unity and solidarity. A landmark step, Dr Yusupov highlighted, was the March 31, 2025, trilateral summit in Khujand, where the presidents of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement defining the junction point of their state borders, a symbolic affirmation that peace and harmony outweigh territorial tensions. Quoting Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Dr Yusupov recalled, \"Today, Central Asia is different - it is united and strong, open to dialogue and full-scale partnership.\" He added that the guiding principle for the region's diplomacy is now clear: \"If you want peace, be friends with your neighbours.\" The Fergana Valley, chosen as the venue for the forum, embodies this philosophy. Historically a melting pot of cultures, religions, and languages along the Great Silk Road, it remains a symbol of coexistence. The valley spans Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, housing about 17 million people, and has long been a crossroads of trade, learning, and harmony. The Fergana Peace Forum will bring together government officials, business leaders, and scholars from across the region, alongside representatives from major international bodies including the CIS, SCO, OSCE, UNDP, EU, and other global partners. Dr Yusupov emphasized that Uzbekistan's inclusive policies, such as offering education in multiple languages and supporting over 17 national cultural centers in Fergana, Andijan, and Namangan, demonstrate how diversity can become a strength. Backed by both domestic and international organizations, including the World Bank, UN Women, and the International Organization for Migration, numerous local initiatives are enhancing social protection, women's empowerment, and interethnic harmony in the region. \"The first Fergana Peace Forum opens a new page in the development of good neighbourly relations in Central Asia,\" Dr Yusupov concluded. \"It reflects the valley's historic role as a space for mutual understanding and will further strengthen regional stability and cooperation.\"",
