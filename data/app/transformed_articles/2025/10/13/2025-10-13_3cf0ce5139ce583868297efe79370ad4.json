    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP): Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Professor Ahsan Iqbal on Monday said that India, after facing defeat in Ma'arka-e-Haq, was making desperate attempts to destabilize Pakistan and stir internal unrest through \"facilitators.\" In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he said the dangerous role of Fitna-e-Khawarij in this conspiracy was also evident and alarming. He noted that while the people of Palestine were celebrating a ceasefire and peace deal in Gaza, a religious group in Pakistan - inactive for the past two years - suddenly began inciting its followers with emotional slogans and calls for chaos, including the so-called Islamabad March.\"Whose facilitation is this, after all?\" he questioned. Ahsan said Pakistan today needed peace, stability, and economic revival. \"At this moment, any elements that disrupt the peace and stability of Pakistan are, in fact, facilitating the enemies of the country. Such elements are neither tolerable in any country nor acceptable in the national interest,\" he remarked.",
