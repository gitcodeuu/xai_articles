    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP):Chairman Senate Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani has said that Pakistan, Turkiye and Azerbaijan are united by the unbreakable bonds of faith, shared destiny and an unwavering belief in unity. He said this while addressing the inaugural session of the Third Trilateral Speakers' Conference of the parliaments of Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and Turkiye, held here at the Parliament House on Monday. Chairman Gilani said it was a great honor and privilege for him to address a gathering of nations whose friendship is rooted not in temporary interests but in the enduring foundation of faith and conviction. He thanked Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq for bringing the three brotherly nations together on one platform at a time when unity among them carries both a message and a mission. Referring to the conference theme, \"Strengthening bonds of brotherhood: parliamentary cooperation for regional peace, security, and prosperity,\" the Chairman said the subject was deeply meaningful and close to his heart as a parliamentarian and as someone who believes in the power of dialogue, dignity, and democracy. Recalling his tenure as Prime Minister of Pakistan, Gilani said he had the honor of meeting the leadership of Turkiye and Azerbaijan, where he witnessed first-hand the spirit of brotherhood, resilience, and progress that defined both nations. \"Turkiye is a nation that takes pride in its past and has faith in its future, while Azerbaijan has turned its land - once marked by conflict - into a symbol of reconstruction and development,\" he observed. Chairman Gilani underscored that the friendship among Pakistan, Turkiye and Azerbaijan is not a product of circumstance but a fraternity rooted in belief and shared values - one that has withstood wars, sanctions, and global transformations. The three countries, he said, have always respected each other's sovereignty and dignity - whether during the Khilafat Movement, Pakistan's unwavering support for Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, or Turkiye's consistent stance on the Kashmir issue. \"The strength of the Ummah lies not in its numbers but in the unity of its purpose,\" he declared, adding that this truth holds even greater significance today, as the Muslim world faces trials of injustice and oppression in Palestine, Kashmir, and other regions. In such times, he said, parliaments must become centers of conscience, wisdom, and courage. Gilani emphasized that the Trilateral Forum is more than a diplomatic exercise - it is a living expression of shared values and solidarity. \"If we expand cooperation in security, trade, education, technology, and culture, we can build a bridge of trust, respect, and shared vision - stretching from Ankara to Islamabad and Baku.\" He noted that, in the context of the upcoming Inter-Parliamentary Speakers' Conference (ISC) scheduled in Islamabad next month, the trilateral meeting marks the beginning of a new chapter in parliamentary diplomacy. \"It demonstrates that despite global uncertainty, our commitment to peace, progress, and prosperity remains firm,\" he added. Concluding his address, Chairman Gilani said, \"Peace and prosperity are not destinations but a journey - and our nations walk this path together.\" He reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve, along with Turkiye and Azerbaijan, to further strengthen their partnership for a just, peaceful, and prosperous future for the generations to come. \"Justice is our duty, peace is our right, and unity is our survival,\" Gilani declared, praying that the friendship among Pakistan, Turkiye, and Azerbaijan - born of faith, nurtured through sacrifice, and destined for greatness - may endure forever.",
