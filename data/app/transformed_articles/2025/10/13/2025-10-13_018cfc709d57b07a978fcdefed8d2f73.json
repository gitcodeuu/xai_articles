    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Monday, reiterated that Pakistan stood in solidarity with all nations in reaffirming their collective responsibility to build a safer, more resilient and sustainable world. On the occasion of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, he reaffirmed Pakistan's steadfast commitment to global efforts aimed at reducing disaster risk, vulnerability and losses. In a message on the observance of the Day on October 13, the DPM/FM stressed that reducing disaster risk was essential not only for humanitarian reasons but also for achieving sustainable development and building climate resilience. \"In recent years, Pakistan has endured the devastating impacts of climate-induced disasters-from unprecedented floods, such as those in 2022, to recurring droughts and heatwaves. The recent intense monsoon rainfall, which resulted in the loss of lives and livelihoods, is yet another stark reminder of the immense burden Pakistan continues to bear due to climate change,\" Foreign Office Spokesperson, in a press release, quoted the DPM/FM as saying. Dar further said that these experiences had strengthened their resolve to focus on proactive, technology-driven, and inclusive disaster risk management. Guided by the National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy 2025-2030, Pakistan was pursuing a comprehensive, multi-hazard approach that emphasized prevention, preparedness, and resilience-building at the national, provincial, and district levels, he added. Aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030), the DPM/FM said their policies prioritized strengthening early warning systems, advancing anticipatory action, integrating risk reduction into development planning, and leveraging innovation and technology to better anticipate and manage emerging risks. \"We also urge the international community to strengthen cooperation, enhance technology transfer, and augment financing mechanisms to enable developing countries to mitigate and adapt to the accelerating impacts of climate change,\" he added.",
