    "article_body": "SHARM EL SHEIKH, Oct 13 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif Monday here again nominated the United States President Donald Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to stop war between Pakistan and India and seven other conflicts in the world. Speaking during a press conference at the signing of the Gaza Peace Agreement, he said, \"Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by US President Donald Trump.\" He said, \"President Trump is genuinely a man of peace who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.\" \"Pakistan had nominated President Donald Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop war between Pakistan and India and then achieve ceasefire, along with his very wonderful team,\" he added. He said, \"Today again I would like to nominate this great President for Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel that he is the most genuine, and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he had brought peace in South Asia, saving lives of millions of people.\" \"Now today here in Sharm El Sheikh he is achieving peace in Gaza and saving millions of lives in the Middle East,\" he noted. He said, \"Mr President I would like to salute you for your exemplary leadership, visionary leadership. I think you are the man the world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything, went out of his way to stop eight wars.\" \"Suffice is to say had he (President Trump) not intervened along with his wonderful team, during those four days, the war could have escalated between India and Pakistan and who would have lived to tell what happened. Both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers,\" he explained. The Prime Minister said, \"Similarly here in this part of the world, in the Middle East, contributions of President Trump and Egypt's President Sisi will be remembered in history with golden words.\" \"May God bless you. God give you long life to serve like this for all times to come,\" he told President Trump. The Prime Minister also thanked the Amir of Qatar, President of Turkiye, King of Jordan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and leadership of United Arab Emirates for working very hard and making valuable contributions for achieving peace in Gaza and the region. While speaking on the occasion, President Trump thanked the Prime Minister for his remarks. The President called Chief of Army Staff Syed Asim Munir his favourite Field Marshal.",
