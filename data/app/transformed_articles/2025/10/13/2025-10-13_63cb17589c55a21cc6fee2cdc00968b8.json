    "article_body": "LAHORE, Oct 13 (APP):A sessions court on Monday dismissed the bail petition of Khawaja Aqeel, alias Gogi Butt, the prime suspect in the Ameer Balaj murder case, over his non-appearance before the court. Additional District and Sessions Judge Syed Najaf Haider Kazmi conducted the hearing and noted that despite repeated calls, neither the accused nor his counsel appeared before the court, even though the interim bail had expired. The court subsequently dismissed the bail plea for non-prosecution. CCD Investigating Officer, Muhammad Latif, was present during the proceedings. On the previous hearing, held on October 8, the court had extended Gogi Butt's interim bail until October 13 and directed all parties to present their arguments without fail at the next hearing. Ameer Balaj, owner of a goods transport network, was shot dead in a wedding ceremony at Chuhng area in February last year. He was the son of Arif Ameer, alias Tepu Truckanwala, who was murdered in a gun attack at Lahore airport in 2010. It may be recalled that Chuhng Police registered a murder case against Gogi Butt and others in connection with Balaj's killing. Meanwhile, another key suspect in the same case, Khawaja Tareef Butt, alias Teefi Butt, was killed in an alleged encounter between police and criminals last Saturday.",
