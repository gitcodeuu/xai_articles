Talking to APP, the ministry's spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt said 44,000 pilgrims have so far finalized their bookings under the private Hajj scheme, against the total quota of 60,000 allocated for 2026. He emphasized that, under the approved Hajj policy, completing the booking process by the deadline is mandatory for all private Hajj applicants. The ministry advised intending pilgrims to make their arrangements only through the Hajj companies approved by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony and to ensure payments are made via official banking channels. Pilgrims have also been urged to obtain a copy of their Hajj agreement for record and verification purposes. Furthermore, applicants who have already completed their bookings can review and verify their details through the ministry's official website www.mora.gov.pk or via the mobile application - Pak Hajj 2026. The ministry reiterated its commitment to ensuring a transparent, secure, and efficient process for all pilgrims and urged those planning to perform Hajj under the private scheme to avoid last-minute delays and complete their registrations before the deadline, he maintained.",
