    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP):Pakistan has taken a significant step toward strengthening its carbon market governance and pricing frameworks under the Supporting Preparedness for Article 6 Cooperation (SPAR6C) initiative, funded by the German Federal Government. Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Senator Dr. Musadik Malik, met with Helene Paust, Deputy Head of Cooperation at the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Islamabad, along with representatives from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and UNEP-CCC to review progress under the SPAR6C programme. The meeting focused on advancing Pakistan's transition from readiness to implementation in developing a transparent, credible, and high-integrity carbon market aligned with global standards. Both sides emphasized the importance of robust governance and fair pricing mechanisms to ensure environmental integrity and attract international investment. Highlighting the country's commitment, Dr. Musadik Malik said, \"Carbon markets are not just about trading credits; they're about valuing climate action fairly and ensuring that every ton reduced translates into real benefits for our people and our economy.\" The collaboration under the SPAR6C programme aims to help Pakistan mobilize climate finance, foster innovation, and achieve its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) through sustainable, market-based approaches.",
