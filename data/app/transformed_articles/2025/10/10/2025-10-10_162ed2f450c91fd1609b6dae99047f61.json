    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 10 (APP): In the latest edition of its Thought Leaders Forum (TLF), the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) hosted former Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral (R) Zafar Mahmood Abbasi NI(M). The session was titled, 'Maritime Security and Blue Economy.' Director General ISSI Ambassador Sohail Mahmood, in his remarks, stated that this session was organized to provide a perspective on the role of naval power, complementing the previous two TLF sessions held in the backdrop of May 2025 conflict between India and Pakistan. It was also designed to have an informed discourse on the challenges in the way of effectively harnessing Pakistan's 'blue economy' potential, said a press release issued on Friday. Ambassador Sohail Mahmood added that Pakistan's geographical position strongly underscores its significant geo-economic and geo-strategic relevance. He highlighted three key challenges to the country's maritime environment: (i) strategic competition in the Indian Ocean Region, particularly India's rapid naval modernization; (ii) non-traditional threats including piracy, terrorism, human and drug trafficking, and the adverse effects of climate change; and (iii) geopolitical rivalries that increasingly play out in the Indian Ocean, with major powers seeking influence and access. Recent provocative statements and aggressive signaling by the Indian political and military leadership reinforce the imperative of preparedness in the naval domain. Pakistan's maritime strategy must continue to be extremely vigilant to effectively tackle the emerging challenges and to seize new opportunities, including through enhanced regional cooperation. He also underlined the importance of appropriately adjusting a primarily continental mind-set to focus on the increasingly important maritime domain as well. While highlighting Pakistan's vast untapped marine resources and the blue economy potential, the DG ISSI noted several structural challenges, including an inadequate regulatory framework, a fragile institutional setup, limited maritime infrastructure, security concerns, technological lag, insufficient human expertise, and economic uncertainties. He emphasized the need for collaboration between the government, Pakistan Navy, industry, academia, and civil society in order to unlock the potential and reap rich dividends. Admiral (R) Zafar Mahmood Abbasi, in his wide-ranging talk, outlined that Pakistan's maritime domain, though strategically significant, has long been neglected. He opined that the current global geopolitical environment is defined by a divide between the Global North and South, where the former pursues hegemonic, zero-sum policies while the latter emphasizes inclusive growth. This imbalance, coupled with an interest-based capitalist system, has deepened inequality and instability, dynamics also reflected in the maritime sphere. Admiral (R) Abbasi added that maritime security is crucial for Pakistan's defence and economic growth. It includes protection against armed aggression, terrorism, piracy, and drug trafficking. The principal threat originates from India, requiring robust seaward defenses and deterrence strategies. Despite operational strengths, the absence of a Pakistan Navy (PN) base at Gwadar remains a strategic gap. In peacetime, the Pakistan Navy advances national interests through participation in the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), Regional Maritime Security Patrols (RMSP), and coordination roles under NAVAREA IX and SAR frameworks. Pakistan's coastal defences have improved since the establishment of the Coastal Command in 2005 and deployment of Pak Marines in 2018. The PN plays a vital role in multinational operations, including CTF-150 and CTF-151, combating terrorism, piracy, and drug trafficking. Economically, Pakistan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and Extended Continental Shelf expanded in 2015 through efforts of the PN and NIO, contain vast untapped resources, including significant oil, gas, and mineral reserves. A revitalized shipbuilding industry and greater reliance on indigenous shipping could save valuable foreign exchange. The fishing sector, despite potential, faces overfishing, pollution, and weak regulation. Strengthening governance and modernizing infrastructure could enhance exports and empower coastal communities. Overall, Pakistan's maritime sector offers immense opportunities for economic development, provided the mutual coordination among diverse stakeholder is strengthened maritime security and institutional focus remain central to national policy, he concluded. Earlier, in his introductory remarks, Director China-Pakistan Study Centre, Dr. Talat Shabbir, highlighted the timeliness of the discussion and said that today's session is of immense relevance in an era where oceans play a defining role in shaping economic prosperity, environmental sustainability, and geopolitical stability. The address was followed by a thought-provoking question and answer session, where participants engaged deeply with the speaker on evolving dynamics of maritime security and blue economy, and the related challenges. Ambassador Khalid Mahmood presented a memento to Admiral (R) Zafar Mahmood Abbasi. The session brought together scholars, diplomats, and policy experts for an insightful discussion on matters related to maritime security and blue economy.",
