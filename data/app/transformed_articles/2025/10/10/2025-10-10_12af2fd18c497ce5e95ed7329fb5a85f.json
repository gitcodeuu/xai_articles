Speaking in the House about the upcoming festival, he said that the timely payment of salaries would enable Hindu employees to celebrate their religious occasion with ease and dignity. He also requested the Minister for Power to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply during Diwali, particularly at temples. \"I appeal to all concerned authorities, especially the Sindh government, to release salaries in advance so that our Hindu brothers and sisters can fully enjoy their festival.
