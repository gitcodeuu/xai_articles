    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) has announced a comprehensive institutional restructuring and digital transformation initiative. According to PM&DC, the restructuring process was started with an aim to modernize its systems, enhancing transparency, and improving service delivery across all operational domains. The reform seeks to align PM&DC's functions with international best practices and reinforce its role in upholding excellence in medical and dental education, licensing, and professional regulation in Pakistan. President PM&DC, Prof Dr Rizwan Taj, termed the initiative a \"new era of institutional excellence and transparency,\" noting that the Council has completed an extensive review and redesign of its organizational structure. \"Job descriptions for every position have been clearly defined to ensure clarity in roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines, thereby promoting accountability and eliminating redundancy,\" he stated. As part of the restructuring, PM&DC is filling all key vacant positions to strengthen financial discipline, legal compliance, and administrative efficiency. The timely induction of qualified professionals will further boost digital governance and institutional capacity, he added. To ensure performance-based accountability, the Council has introduced monthly and annual performance assessment mechanisms, including Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) and structured evaluations that will guide promotions and career progression. A performance-based monetary reward system will also recognize and incentivize outstanding employees. Recognizing that institutional excellence depends on skilled human capital, PM&DC has launched extensive training and capacity-building programs for its employees. These included workshops and professional development sessions conducted by leading experts to enhance technical, administrative, and leadership competencies. In line with its vision of a fully digital ecosystem, PM&DC is implementing a robust Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to streamline all processes - from registration and licensing to accreditation and HR management. The ERP rollout will ensure data accuracy, faster service delivery, and improved user experience for all stakeholders. To reinforce good governance, the Council has established a comprehensive internal control system to prevent procedural lapses and strengthen financial and administrative oversight. A new user-friendly digital interface is also being launched, offering secure and accessible online services for applicants, institutions, and practitioners. Examination registration systems for MDCAT, NRE, and NEB have been fully digitalized, enabling seamless online registration, real-time tracking, and automated processing to ensure transparency and efficiency. To enhance regional accessibility, PM&DC has established Regional Facilitation Centers in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta, and Gilgit-Baltistan to provide equitable access to licensing, registration, and accreditation services nationwide. Reaffirming the Council's commitment, Prof Dr Rizwan Taj emphasized, \"Our focus is on efficiency, accountability, and innovation. Through digital transformation, good governance, and continuous staff development, PM&DC is determined to serve the medical and dental community with integrity and professionalism.\" The restructuring initiative, he added, will boost operational efficiency through automation and accountability, enhance employee motivation via transparent evaluation and reward systems, and reinforce governance across all departments, ensuring greater institutional integrity and international credibility.",
