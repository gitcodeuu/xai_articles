    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Immigration staff at Islamabad International Airport arrested a proclaimed offender wanted by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in connection with a massive fraud case exceeding Rs3 billion. An FIA official told APP on Friday that the accused, Abdul Latif, was taken into custody upon his arrival from Qatar through flight EY303. His name had been placed on the stop list, which enabled immigration officials to intercept him immediately after landing. The official added that Abdul Latif had been wanted by NAB for several years in corruption and fraud cases involving the manipulation of financial records and the misappropriation of billions of rupees. Following the arrest, FIA Immigration Islamabad handed the suspect over to NAB authorities for further legal proceedings. The FIA official reiterated that the agency will continue its robust crackdown against fugitives, proclaimed offenders, and those involved in financial crimes, fraud, and corruption, ensuring no offender escapes accountability.",
