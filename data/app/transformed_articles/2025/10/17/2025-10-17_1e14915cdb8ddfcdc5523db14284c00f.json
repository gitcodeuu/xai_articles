    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): The Prime Minister's Youth Programme (PMYP) has achieved a remarkable milestone as the number of registered users on its flagship Digital Youth Hub platform has now crossed 700,000 young people across Pakistan. This achievement marks a major step forward in the government's mission to digitally empower and connect the country's youth with opportunities for growth and development. Launched a few months ago under the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Digital Youth Hub was created as a one-stop digital gateway to consolidate all youth-related facilities in one accessible platform. The initiative aims to make information and opportunities more transparent, efficient, and easily available to young Pakistanis across every province and region. Through the Hub, youth can now explore a wide range of opportunities including scholarships, skills development courses, job openings, internships, youth loans, and the Prime Minister's Laptop Scheme , all available with just a single click. The platform eliminates the need to visit multiple government departments or websites, saving time and ensuring equal access for every young person regardless of their background or location. Chairman PMYP Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan expressed his satisfaction over the growing number of registrations, calling it \"a reflection of the youth's trust in the government's commitment to digital facilitation.\" He said the response from young people across the country has been \"overwhelming and inspiring,\" showing that the nation's youth are ready to embrace technology as a means to progress. According to Rana Mashhood, this success is not just about numbers , it represents a shift in mindset. \"The Digital Youth Hub has given young Pakistanis a sense of empowerment. It has made opportunities visible and reachable,\" he said. \"This platform connects ambition with action and hope with possibility.\" The Chairman explained that before this initiative, youth programs were scattered across different ministries and websites, creating confusion and inefficiency. \"Now, everything is integrated. Whether you're a student looking for a scholarship, a graduate searching for a job, or an entrepreneur seeking a loan, the Digital Youth Hub is your complete guide,\" he added. Rana Mashhood emphasized that the Hub is part of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vision of a 'Digital Pakistan', where technology drives inclusion and governance becomes smarter. \"We are working not only to provide digital tools but to prepare digital citizens capable, confident, and globally competitive,\" he said. He also highlighted that the Digital Youth Hub functions as a data-driven ecosystem, allowing the government to better understand youth needs and design programs accordingly. The data collected helps policymakers identify trends such as which regions require more job support or where training programs are most in demand , ensuring that resources are directed effectively. Rana Mashhood further revealed that several new features are being developed for the platform's next phase. These include mentorship programs, virtual job fairs, and partnerships with universities and industries to strengthen the link between education and employment. \"Our goal is to make the Digital Youth Hub the most comprehensive youth facilitation system in Pakistan's history,\" he stated. He praised the efforts of the PMYP team and the Ministry of Information Technology for ensuring the platform's accessibility and user-friendly design. \"The increasing number of young people joining every day is a sign that Pakistan's youth is ready to lead the nation's digital transformation,\" he remarked. As registrations continue to climb, the Digital Youth Hub stands as one of the most successful examples of e-governance and youth engagement in Pakistan by bridging the gap between opportunity and ambition, and turning the dream of youth empowerment into a digital reality.",
