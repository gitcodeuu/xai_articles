    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Kareem Kundi on Friday inaugurated Pakistan's first-ever mega festival, Dreamfest 2025 at the Jinnah Sports Complex, Islamabad. The three-day spectacle aims to celebrate the country's rich tapestry of sport, music, food, and culture, bringing together local and international talent on an unprecedented scale. Speaking to journalists at the opening ceremony, Governor Kundi said he was \"delighted to see Pakistan's cultural diversity and global talent converge under one platform.\" He hailed DreamFest 2025 as a reflection of a modern, confident and inclusive Pakistan, adding that such events \"embody the spirit of our youth, the creativity of our artists and the unity of our nation.\" \"This festival not only offers entertainment but also promotes tourism, supports small businesses and showcases Pakistan's positive image internationally,\" he remarked. \"It is my hope that DreamFest becomes an annual feature - a festival the nation looks forward to each year.\" The festival's music line-up features leading Pakistani performers, including Asim Azhar, Young Stunners, Nimra Mehra, Havi, and Samar Jafri, among others, who are set to deliver a series of high-energy performances throughout the weekend. One of the main highlights will be the Celebrities vs Diplomats Football Charity Match, with popular names such as Junaid Khan, Mani, Mohsin Abbas Haider, Faizan Shaikh, Bilal Qureshi and Agha Talal taking to the field. According to organisers, a portion of the proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to flood relief efforts, giving the festival a charitable dimension. Organisers say the event will offer a unique, family-friendly experience featuring concerts, cultural exhibitions, food stalls, sports tournaments and interactive activities across its three days - a celebration of Pakistan's creativity, resilience and cultural vibrancy. Tickets for DreamFest 2025 are now available via Bookme.pk.",
