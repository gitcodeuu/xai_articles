    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): The National Assembly Standing Committee on Federal Education and Professional Training on Friday expressed grave concern over the lack of basic facilities in schools, rising incidents of child abuse and drug use in educational institutions. The committee, which met under the convenorship of Dr Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro, MNA, at the Parliament House, unanimously recommended \"The Allied Institute Multan Bill, 2025\" for approval, said a press release. The committee revealed serious concerns regarding missing basic facilities in educational institutions, student safety, and the regulation of private schools, while also commending ongoing efforts in higher education quality assurance. The Committee criticized the lack of basic facilities in numerous schools, particularly those previously identified by the committee and shared with the Ministry. It was emphasized that the absence of essential amenities like clean drinking water, functional sanitation etc shows the oversight and implementation delays. In response, the Ministry informed the Committee that progress is being made under the project \"Provision of Basic Education Facilities in Educational Institutions of ICT under FDE.\" Work is currently ongoing in 167 schools, with 71 institutions nearing completion. The NA panel expressed alarm over reported incidents of child abuse and drug abuse within educational institutions. Members unanimously declared that schools and colleges must be safe havens for learning and development, not environments where students are exposed to exploitation or harmful substances. While the Committee acknowledged the establishment of Child Protection Committees in government schools, it stressed that their formation alone is insufficient. Members highlighted an urgent need for a multi-faceted approach that drives behavioral change, challenges social stereotypes, and actively involves parents and communities in awareness and prevention initiatives. The Committee asked the Ministry to provide comprehensive details of all reported child abuse cases, including actions taken and prevent recurrence. The Committee also discussed the exorbitant fees charged by many private educational institutions, citing the unbearable financial burden placed on parents. It asked the Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Authority (PEIRA) to present a comprehensive fee policy to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability. The Committee underscored the necessity for a robust monitoring system and strict compliance with government policy to protect families from exploitation and ensure that quality education remains accessible, not just a privilege for the affluent. The Committee received a briefing from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) on the performance of its Quality Assurance Division. The Committee appreciated the HEC's commendable initiatives aimed at strengthening quality assurance frameworks and ensuring universities adhere to national and international academic standards. Reaffirming its full support, the Committee commended the HEC's dedication to fostering a culture of excellence, innovation, and integrity. It urged sustained efforts to enhance the global competitiveness and national impact of Pakistan's higher education system. The meeting was attended by MNA's including Anjum Aqeel Khan, Zeb Jaffar, Farah Naz Akbar (Parliamentary Secretary), Mehtab Akbar Rashdi, Mussarat Rafique Mahesar, Abdul Aleem Khan, Sabheen Ghoury, Minister of State Wajiha Qamar, Zahra Wadood Fatemi, Khwaja Izhar-ul-Hassan and Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting Barrister Danyal Chaudhry. The meeting was also attended by Secretary and officials of the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training, officials of Higher Education Commission HEC and other officers concerned.",
