    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Friday said that the protest calls from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) for today were inconclusive and had ended up in a no-show. Talking to the media, the minister said cities and markets were bustling, as people from all walks of life, including traders, had completely rejected their calls for protest. Tarar said the public is celebrating Pakistan's crucial role in the Gaza peace process and its foreign policy successes. He specifically highlighted the honor Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received from President of the United States Donald Trump who invited the prime minister to address on the occasion of Gaza peace process in Sharmal Sheikh. The minister reiterated that Pakistan has been strongly advocating for an independent Palestine with Al Quds Sharif as its capital, and has condemned Israeli oppression at every platform. Pakistan is being taken seriously on the global stage following its successes from the \"Mark-e-Haq,\" leading to greater respect for its people worldwide, he said, adding \"this is the respect for Pakistan and it is the Almighty's blessing that the foreign policy is progressing in the right direction, elevating the status of green passport.\" The minister also condemned the \"political stunt\" of Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi, who did not attend a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the repatriation of Afghan refugees. Tarar noted that the meeting, which lauded the sacrifices of Pakistani soldiers, involved important decision-making and follow-up on previous decisions. He stressed that all provincial governments and institutional representatives were present, except for the CM KPK. While CM Advisor Muzamil Hassan attended and briefed the federal government on various initiatives, including a support program for police martyrs, the minister stressed that the CM's presence was highly crucial given the importance of law and order matters in his province. Tarar noted that abstaining from the meeting might be a \"political stunt\" to garner praise on social media, but it would have a serious impact on the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He argued that the CM would waste time understanding the background when he held his own briefing later. The minister called the political point-scoring over an important law and order meeting \"regrettable\". \"The KPK CM's absence showed that he did not believe in discussions,\" he added.",
