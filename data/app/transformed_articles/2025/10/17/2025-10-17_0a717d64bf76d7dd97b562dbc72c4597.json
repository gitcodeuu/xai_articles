President Zardari appreciated Germany's longstanding partnership with Pakistan and its continued support in areas of climate action, women empowerment, social protection, and human development. He highlighted the need for expeditious finalization of the Pakistan-Germany Climate Partnership Agreement, noting that both countries share common goals in addressing global climate challenges. The President welcomed German investments in Pakistan, particularly in the renewable energy, IT, and industrial sectors, and underlined Pakistan's special incentives for foreign investors. He observed that the early establishment of a Pakistan-Germany Chamber of Commerce in Karachi would further deepen trade and economic ties. Discussing the strategic dialogue between the two countries, the President welcomed Germany's offer to host the 6th Round of Pakistan-Germany Strategic Dialogue later this year, and appreciated the positive trajectory of bilateral cooperation in regional and international fora. President Zardari also acknowledged Germany's role in facilitating the Afghan relocation programme and lauded the country's continued support for Pakistan's GSP+ status within the European Union.
