    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday stopped Drugs Regulatory Authority Pakistan (DRAP) from action against medical devices dealers association and sought answers from respondents within two weeks. The court also issued a notice to the Attorney General for assistance in the case. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro issued a written order for hearing on the application of the Pakistan Medical Devices Dealers Association, which stated that according to the petitioner, IVD devices are not a cure, but only help in diagnosis. DRAP has also included those medical devices under its jurisdiction that it is only allowed to monitor. According to the petitioner's lawyer, DRAP has also made diagnostic equipment or IVD medical devices subject to registration. DRAP's SRO is against the law. Due to DRAP's SRO, importers and the health industry are facing difficulties. According to the petitioner's lawyer, there is a shortage of medical devices across the country due to the SRO. In the order, the court said that DRAP and other institutions should not take any action against the petitioners until the next hearing.",
