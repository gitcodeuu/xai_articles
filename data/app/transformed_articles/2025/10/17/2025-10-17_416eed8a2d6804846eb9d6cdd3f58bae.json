    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): Chairperson of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid has reaffirmed Pakistan's strong commitment to ending poverty, empowering women and promoting inclusive economic growth in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In her message on the occasion of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, Senator Rubina Khalid said that BISP stands as Pakistan's flagship social protection programme and one of the leading initiatives of its kind in the world, transforming millions of lives by providing a safety net to the poorest households and creating pathways toward self-reliance and dignity. \"Poverty is not just the lack of income; it is the absence of opportunity and empowerment. BISP has empowered millions of women across Pakistan by making them financially independent and giving them a voice in household, community, and political decisions,\" she said. Highlighting the government's focus on sustainable poverty reduction, Senator Rubina Khalid said that the newly launched Benazir Hunarmand Programme marks a major step forward in the poverty graduation journey of BISP beneficiary families. \"Launched on June 21, the birthday of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, by President Asif Ali Zardari at the Aiwan-e-Sadr, the Benazir Hunarmand Programme is designed to equip beneficiaries with market-driven skills that enhance employability and create economic opportunities,\" she said. \"This initiative continues the vision of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto for a prosperous and equitable Pakistan, where every citizen can contribute productively to the nation's development.\" She said that around 10 million deserving families are currently benefitting from BISP's cash transfer initiatives. In addition, the programme's graduation and skill development components, including Benazir Nashonuma and Benazir Taleemi Wazaif, are helping families move from dependency to self-reliance. Senator Rubina Khalid also said that BISP is taking significant steps toward digitizing payments to ensure that financial assistance reaches beneficiary women directly, transparently, and efficiently. \"Guided by the vision of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, we are soon going to open bank accounts and digital wallet accounts for all BISP beneficiaries, so that financial assistance reaches them securely and without unnecessary human involvement. This digital transformation will further strengthen transparency, accountability, and financial inclusion,\" she added. She also thanked BISP's development partners and donors, including multilateral institutions, bilateral agencies, and international organizations, for their continued trust and collaboration.",
