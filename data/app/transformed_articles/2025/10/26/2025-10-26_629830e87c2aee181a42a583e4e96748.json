    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (APP):Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held separate meetings with British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott and US Charge d'Affaires Natalie Baker in Islamabad on Sunday. Both meetings focused on enhancing bilateral relations, regional security, and cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including counter-narcotics, human trafficking, and security collaboration. During the meeting with the British High Commissioner, Minister Naqvi expressed gratitude to the British government and High Commissioner Jane Marriott for the resumption of direct flight operations between Pakistan and the United Kingdom after a gap of five years. The minister noted that this development would further strengthen people-to-people and business ties between the two countries. The British High Commissioner briefed the interior minister on the upcoming visit of the Director General of the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to Pakistan, scheduled for next month. She informed that during the visit, memorandums of understanding (MoUs) would be signed in the fields of immigration and counter-narcotics cooperation. Minister Naqvi appreciated the UK's ongoing collaboration with Pakistan in law enforcement and capacity building. He highlighted that initiatives such as the establishment of the Centre of Excellence, supported by the British High Commission, would play a vital role in strengthening Pakistan's institutional capacity. \"The establishment of the Centre of Excellence will further enhance mutual legal assistance and extradition cooperation between Pakistan and the United Kingdom,\" he added. Both the British High Commissioner and the US Charge d'Affaires commended the Pakistan Navy's recent successful counter-narcotics operation, praising Pakistan's commitment to combating transnational organized crime. Minister Naqvi reaffirmed Pakistan's firm resolve to work with the international community for the complete eradication of terrorism. \"Pakistan is fully committed to eliminating terrorism and extremism in all its forms,\" he said. US Charge d'Affaires Natalie Baker lauded Pakistan's ongoing efforts to counter terrorism and extremism, describing them as \"highly commendable.\" She reaffirmed Washington's commitment to continued cooperation with Pakistan in security and counter-terrorism domains. High Commissioner Jane Marriott emphasized that the United Kingdom attaches great importance to its relations with Pakistan, and reiterated her country's commitment to deepening cooperation across multiple sectors.",
