    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (APP):Acting Chairman Jammu and Kashmir National Front Altaf Hussain Wani has said that 27 October was the darkest day in Kashmir's recent history. \"India's naked aggression on this fateful day in 1947 is the root cause of the Kashmir conflict that continues to threaten peace and stability in the South Asian region even after the passage of 78 years,\" Wani said in a statement issued here today. This act of aggression, he said, had not only created hurdles in the way of the partition plan but also pushed the entire region into a quagmire of chaos and instability. \"The bloodshed that India started in occupied Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 is still going on unabated,\" the Front leader said, adding that innocent people are still being killed with impunity. Referring to India's history of colonizing Kashmir, he said that the settler-colonial policies of India have instilled a sense of fear among Kashmiris who feel increasingly unsafe even in their homeland. The conflict, he said, has now assumed dangerous proportions after the BJP-led regime stripped the region of its special status guaranteed under Article 370 of the Indian constitution. Terming India's military occupation of Kashmir a great threat to regional peace and stability, Wani said it was alarming that world powers have been ignoring this dangerous aspect of the long-drawn conflict. Urging influential world governments and institutions to take effective notice of the matter, he said, \"The dispute, if left unresolved, is bound to consume more precious lives besides fuelling unrest in this highly volatile region.\" He lamented that along with using its repressive state apparatus, the Indian rulers have been employing colonialbera tactics to crush the Kashmiris' legitimate political aspirations and silence democratic dissent in the region. \"Not with standing its commitments on Kashmir, successive Indian governments have unabashedly pursued a policy of deceit and deception to neutralize the Kashmiris' legitimate struggle for the right to self-determination,\" he added. He noted that the UNSC resolutions, which call for a free and impartial plebiscite in the region, were endorsed by the Indian representative in the UN Security Council, particularly then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Referring to the recent confrontation between India and Pakistan, which brought the two nuclear neighbours to the brink of war, Wani said that the unresolved dispute remains a constant threat to peace and stability in the region. He said it was high time the global community took cognizance of India's prolonged military occupation of the disputed territory and played its role in settling the conflict peacefully in accordance with the UNSC resolutions.",
