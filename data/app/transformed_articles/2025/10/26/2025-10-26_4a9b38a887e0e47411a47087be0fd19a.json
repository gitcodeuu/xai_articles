    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 25 (APP): Pakistan and Iran have discussed to explore new avenues for cooperation in the blue economy by strengthening road, railway, and maritime connectivity between the two neighbouring countries. The development came during a high-level meeting here on Saturday between Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, and Iran's Minister for Roads and Urban Development, Farzaneh Sadegh. During the talks, both sides emphasized the importance of enhancing regional connectivity to promote trade, investment, and people-to-people linkages. The ministers discussed various initiatives to facilitate maritime trade, develop port infrastructure, and improve logistical routes linking the two countries through sea, land, and rail networks. Junaid Chaudhry proposed the launch of a ferry service between Pakistan and Iran, noting that it would provide an affordable and efficient transport alternative for both pilgrims and traders. He stated that Pakistan would welcome any Iranian entrepreneur or company interested in operating such a service, highlighting that Iran's lower fuel prices could help keep fares subsidized and affordable for passengers. \"Such a ferry service would not only enhance bilateral trade but also offer a cost-effective travel option for pilgrims visiting Iran and Iraq,\" Chaudhry said. \"In 2025, around 60,000 to 70,000 Pakistani pilgrims attended Arbaeen by air. A ferry service could potentially multiply those numbers several times.\" The minister also informed about plans to introduce a centralized pilgrim management policy starting next year. Under the new framework, all pilgrims would be required to travel through registered tour operators to ensure greater safety, and coordination. \"Iran can gain significant financial benefits from the growing flow of Pakistani pilgrims,\" he added, stressing the need for infrastructural collaboration to support religious tourism and trade. Iranian Minister welcomed Pakistan's proposals, agreeing that the two countries' ports represent major economic assets that can serve as gateways for regional commerce. She underscored the shared commitment to enhancing port-to-port cooperation and exploring new trade routes in the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. \"The ports of both countries are the financial strength of our economies,\" Farzaneh Sadegh said. \"By improving maritime and transport connectivity, we can open new horizons for regional trade and economic prosperity.\" Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to deepening cooperation in the maritime and transport sectors as part of broader efforts to advance the blue economy and strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations.",
