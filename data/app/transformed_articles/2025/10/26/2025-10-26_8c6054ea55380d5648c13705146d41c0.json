    "article_body": "SUKKUR, Oct 26 (APP):In a meeting presided over by the Divisional Commissioner Sukkur Abid Saleem Qureshi on Sunday, Dr. Jamil from the World Health Organization (WHO) briefed on the recent polio vaccination campaign in Sukkur Division. He stated that the campaign achieved 100% coverage in all clusters, including migrant populations, in Sukkur, Ghotki, and Khairpur districts, except for a few isolated cases of refusal. However, Dr. Jamil expressed concern over the continuous detection of poliovirus environmental samples from the drainage area of Makka Pumping Station in Sukkur. Commissioner Sukkur praised the overall satisfactory results of the polio campaign but emphasized the need for improvement. He directed that those responsible for repeated mistakes in the polio campaign should be replaced with capable and dedicated youth, and action should be taken against them to serve as a lesson to others. The Commissioner appreciated the performance of Assistant Commissioners, particularly AC New Sukkur, Wasim Mehr, who played a crucial role in making the campaign a success in a challenging area. The Commissioner Sukkur expressed concern over the continued cutting of trees and directed the forestry department to work with the police, Rangers, and local dignitaries to address the issue. He suggested using modern technology, such as Google mapping, to monitor forests and prevent tree cutting. The Commissioner directed the forestry department to collaborate with IT experts from Sukkur IBA and Aror University to find a permanent solution to forest surveillance. All Assistant Commissioners briefed the Commissioner Sukkur Division on various revenue-related matters, including land revenue cases, land acquisition, and award passing. The Commissioner directed Assistant Commissioners to dedicate one day a week to social work, conduct community sessions, and take measures to prevent dengue fever. He also emphasized the importance of cleanliness in public areas, hospitals, and bus stands. The Commissioner appreciated the work of Assistant Commissioners and directed them to conduct regular field visits, address complaints promptly, and ensure the provision of quality healthcare services.",
