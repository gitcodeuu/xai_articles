    "article_body": "PESHAWAR, Oct 26 (APP):Renowned for its distinctive aroma and irresistible flavor, Seekh Kabab has carved a special place in Peshawar's rich culinary landscape that attracted food lovers in droves in cold weekend. Celebrated for its robust spiciness and tender texture, this mouthwatering delicacy continues to draw food enthusiasts particularly on weekends toward the city's vibrant food streets and bazaars. Seekh Kabab holds a cherished position among Peshawar's local cuisines, adored for its delectable taste and affordability. Its widespread popularity among both residents and visitors makes it a staple offering at eateries across the city. In the bustling food streets, especially at the historic Qissa Khwani and Namak Mandi bazaars, the smoky aroma of sizzling Seekh and Chappli Kababs fills the air. Vendors prepare the dish in large, black frying pans, attracting diners with the tantalizing sight and sound of meat crackling over open flames. Prepared from minced beef or buffalo meat mixed with corn flour, chopped onions, aromatic spices, and salt, the dish offers a flavor that's both rich and distinctive. Among the city's celebrated vendors is Nisar Khan, who runs a famous Kabab shop at Namak Mandi Bazaar. Sitting confidently in his high chair amid the rush of customers, Nisar proudly carries forward a family legacy that began in 1950. \"After my father's passing, all six of his sons continued the business with the dream of passing it on to the next generation,\" he shares. \"What began with one frying pan 74 years ago has now expanded to six locations, including one at Melody Food Street in Islamabad.\" Nisar displays a large frying pan and trays filled with 50 kilograms of marinated meat. He said demand has surged with the onset of winter, as more customers now prefer takeaway parcels ranging from two to five kilograms for family gatherings. The preparation of Seekh and Chappli Kabab involves finely mincing meat and mixing it with tomatoes, red chili powder, onions, coriander leaves, eggs, ginger, lemon juice, salt, and pomegranate seeds. After marination, the mixture is cooked for about 10 minutes and served hot with chutney, salad, yogurt, and naan-a timeless combination that keeps diners coming back for more. Eminent writer and traveler Qari Javed Iqbal, in his book Saqafat Sarhad Tarikh K Ayeene Me (Frontier Culture in the Mirror of History), traces the origins of Seekh and Chappli Kabab to the Mughal dynasty, noting that invading kings and warriors introduced refined meat preparation techniques to the subcontinent. Today, the fame of Peshawar's kababs extends far beyond its borders to Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, Jalalabad, Kabul, Amritsar, Lucknow, and Delhi, making it a culinary ambassador of the region. In Peshawar alone, over 3300 kabab outlets thrive in areas like Firdus, Bakhshu Bridge, Warsak Road, and Ring Road, underscoring the dish's enduring appeal. Local resident Faraz Khan, savoring a serving at Namak Mandi Bazaar, says, \"Seekh Kabab is my favorite dish-no meal feels complete without its aromatic bites.\" Despite its popularity, prices have risen notably, with one kilogram now selling between Rs950 and Rs1,000, up from Rs850 to Rs900 last year. The increase has prompted calls for regulation to ensure affordability. According to Nisar, the demand for Seekh and Chappli Kababs also extends overseas. \"We send orders to the UAE and Saudi Arabia for weddings and family celebrations,\" he adds with pride. Addressing concerns about food safety, a Food Services and Halal Authority spokesman acknowledged the ongoing challenge of curbing spice adulteration. To improve standards, seven mobile testing laboratories have been deployed across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with plans for ten more. Additionally, food training schools and stricter hygiene regulations are being introduced to preserve the integrity of traditional dishes. As Seekh Kabab continues to tantalize taste buds across generations, its rich history, evolving flavors, and deep cultural roots stand as a testament to Peshawar's vibrant culinary heritage.",
