This initiative reflects NPO Pakistan's unwavering commitment to promoting innovation-driven productivity enhancement and institutional excellence across both public and private sector organizations in Pakistan.

The sessions were facilitated by two international experts from Germany, Dr. Eva Diedrichs and Mr. Claus Diedrichs, who shared their extensive experience in institutionalizing innovation management systems, fostering innovation culture, and aligning organizational strategies with the ISO 56000 Innovation Management Standards. The workshops witnessed active participation from a wide range of public and private sector organizations, including representatives from relevant federal ministries and their attached departments and organizations. Notably, officials from the Ministry of Industries and Production, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Planning, Development and Special initiatives, and other key national institutions including PSQCA, PHA and SMDEA participated in the sessions.

NPO Pakistan welcomed the participants and highlighted the organization's continued collaboration with APO Japan to strengthen Pakistan's capacity for innovation management and productivity-led competitiveness in alignment with national development priorities. Upon successful completion of the workshops, participants were awarded certificates of participation in recognition of their commitment to advancing innovation and productivity within their respective organizations.
