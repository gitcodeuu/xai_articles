    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Sunday, formally unveiled the process for supply of Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) connections to the domestic consumers. Addressing a ceremony here, the prime minister said that restoration of gas connections for the domestic consumers had been a long-standing demand of the people. During the year 2022, when the PDM government was formed, it faced immense pressure over the public demand for provision of gas connections, he added. At that time, gas supply was a big challenge. But afterwards, funds were released and the infrastructure was laid down and now the RLNG supply would be supplied throughout the country to a large number of applicants. The prime minister termed it a continuity of public welfare-oriented policies initiated by the former government of Mian Nawaz Sharif during 2013, adding that when Nawaz Sharif formed government for the third tenure, the country was facing 20-hour duration power load shedding. He also congratulated the coalition government parties including PPP, MQM, BAP and others over the restoration of gas connections to the domestic consumers. On the occasion, he also prayed for the progress and prosperity of Pakistan and stressed upon hard work and dedication. The ceremony was attended by Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, ministers, secretaries, officials of SNGPL and parliamentarians. Earlier, in a video message Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik apprised that the SNGPL had brought down its line losses to 4.93 percent while earning a profit of Rs29 billion in the previous year.",
