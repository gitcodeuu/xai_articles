    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (APP): The Government of Pakistan, along with people across the country and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), will observe Kashmir Black Day on Monday to express solidarity with the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). On the instructions of Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif, a notification also has been issued to observe a minute of silence on October 27, to mark Black Day against illegal India occupation and to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people. A minute of silence will be observed across the country on October 27 at 10 am. Every year, Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control and across the world observe October 27 as \"Kashmir Black Day\" to mark the day in 1947 when Indian troops landed in Srinagar, the beginning of the illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir by India. The day serves as a reminder of the unfulfilled pledges made to the people of Kashmir and the continuing struggle for their right to self-determination as recognized under the United Nations Security Council resolutions. On this day in 1947, Indian forces entered the territory of Jammu and Kashmir after the signing of the controversial Instrument of Accession by Maharaja Hari Singh, the then ruler of the princely state. Pakistan and the Kashmiri leadership rejected the move, maintaining that it was made under duress and did not reflect the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. The event triggered the first Indo-Pak war, resulting in the division of the region by the Line of Control (LoC) - a boundary that continues to separate families and communities to this day. Across Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), the day is observed with rallies, seminars, walks, and photo exhibitions highlighting the sufferings of the Kashmiri people and reaffirming solidarity with their cause. Participants wear black armbands, hoist black flags, and organize public gatherings to denounce what they call India's occupation and its human rights violations in the IIOJK. In solidarity with the Kashmiri people, the Government of Pakistan will observe one-minute silence at 8:00 a.m. across the country. Government departments, civil society organizations, and political parties issue statements calling upon the international community to play its role in ensuring the implementation of UN resolutions guaranteeing the Kashmiri people's right to decide their future. Over the decades, numerous reports by international human rights organizations have drawn attention to issues such as enforced disappearances, curfews, communication blockades, and restrictions on movement in IIOJK. Since the revocation of Article 370 by the Indian government in August 2019, observers note that the situation has further deteriorated, with increased restrictions on civil liberties and political activities. Pakistan has consistently maintained that the Kashmir dispute must be resolved in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. On this day, Pakistan reiterates its moral, diplomatic, and political support to the Kashmiri people until they achieve their legitimate right to self-determination. The national leadership in their messages reaffirm Pakistan's unwavering solidarity with the people of Jammu and Kashmir and urge the global community to take notice of the longstanding dispute that threatens regional peace and stability. The observance of Kashmir Black Day is not only a protest against the events of October 27, 1947, but also a call for justice, peace, and dialogue. Kashmir remains one of the most militarized regions in the world, and experts agree that sustainable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without a just settlement of the dispute. As the world marks another Kashmir Black Day, voices from across Pakistan and AJK renew the demand that the international community fulfill its commitments to the people of Kashmir and help pave the way for lasting peace in the region. All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC)'s Senior Leader and its former Secretary Information Imtiaz Wani while talking to APP said that India's prolonged military occupation over the territory was a threat to peace and stability in the region. He said that the invasion on Kashmir by India on October 27, 1947 was a naked aggression devoid of legal and moral justification. Terming it as an atrocious attack on the political and democratic rights of millions of Kashmiris, Imtiaz Wani said that on this fateful day the so-called democratic state had brazenly violated the international law by usurping the fundamental rights of the people of Kashmir. Recalling Kashmiris' historic resistance against the Indian occupation he said that despite suffering at the hands of Indian tyrants the valiant people of Kashmir have never accepted its dominance over the region. Kashmiris have neither accepted the hegemony of the Indian state in the past nor will they accept it in the future, Wani said, adding that day was not far when Kashmiris' struggle and their sacrifices for the noble cause would reach to fruition. About the Modi government's unlawful actions it had taken on Kashmir since 5th August 2019, Wani said Kashmiris have fairly and squarely rejected the move and there were no takers in Kashmir of what the BJP has been remorselessly projecting to deceive the international community. He said that any piece of legislation made by the Indian parliament cannot supersede the UN resolutions which clearly state that no country can change the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir unilaterally. Urging the world community to play its proactive role to end India's prolonged military occupation he said that the world needs to realize the devastating impacts of the 78-year long illegal occupation of India on Kashmir. Syed Gulshan Ahmed, Member All Parties Hurriyat Conference and Vice Chairman Tehreek-e-Istiqama Jammu and Kashmir, said that on October 27, 1947, the long sacrifices, wishes, feelings and political aspirations of the Kashmiri people were not taken into account. He said that atrocities were committed against the innocent people and the Kashmiris were completely deprived of their basic human rights. This is why the Kashmiri people remember October 27 as a black day. He said that since October 27, 1947, the people of the state have been courageously fighting against Indian oppression and atrocities and have been resisting the forcible occupation for the past eight decades alongside the freedom struggle movement. He stated that we thank the Government of Pakistan and the Armed Forces for highlighting the suffering of the Kashmiri people at the political, diplomatic and moral levels through delegations and diplomatic channels to the whole world. Which the Kashmiri people appreciate, he said, adding that it is hoped that soon, God willing, the Kashmiri nation will be able to bring its struggle to a logical conclusion.",
