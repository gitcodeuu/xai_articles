    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 25 (APP):Emirates, the world's largest international airline, celebrated 40 years of operations to Karachi by showcasing its retrofitted Boeing 777 aircraft featuring the airline's latest Premium Economy cabin. The special event, held at Jinnah International Airport, marked four decades since Emirates' inaugural flight EK600 took off from Dubai to Karachi in 1985-its first-ever international route. The milestone celebration brought together key stakeholders, diplomats, and government officials, who were given an exclusive tour of the newly reconfigured four-class aircraft. The showcase flight, operating as EK600, landed in Karachi at 10:45 a.m., offering guests an up-close look at Emirates' new Premium Economy experience, which is being gradually introduced across its global network. Among the dignitaries present were the Consul General of the United Arab Emirates, H.E. Bakheet Ateeq Al-Rumaithi, along with senior officials from Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority and airport management. The event was hosted by Emirates' Vice President for Pakistan, Mohammed Alhashmi. Speaking on the occasion, Mohammed Alhashmi said, \"Karachi holds a special place in Emirates' history as the destination of our maiden international flight from Dubai. Over the past 40 years, we have proudly connected Pakistan to the world, supporting travellers, businesses, and communities. Our partnership has contributed significantly to Pakistan's aviation growth, economy, and employment generation.\" He added that Emirates remains committed to enhancing the customer experience and hopes to introduce its Premium Economy product to Karachi in the future. \"Emirates Premium Economy has redefined comfort for a growing segment of travellers seeking an upgraded experience at competitive value. We are excited to continue its rollout to key destinations for our valued customers,\" he said. Since launching operations in 1985, Emirates has operated more than 87,000 flights between Dubai and Karachi, carrying over 19 million passengers. Across its five destinations in Pakistan, the airline has served over 36 million passengers on 146,000 flights. Beyond passenger operations, Emirates plays a vital role in Pakistan's trade, transporting more than 73,000 tonnes of cargo annually, including key exports and imports. Interestingly, the airline's first-ever revenue flight to Karachi generated income solely from cargo, as passengers on that historic trip flew free of charge. With three daily flights connecting Karachi to Dubai and beyond, Emirates continues to serve as a major link between Pakistan and global destinations such as Jeddah, Medina, Toronto, London, New York, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne, and Manchester. The retrofitted Boeing 777 features Emirates' latest Premium Economy cabin - designed to provide enhanced comfort and style for travellers. The cabin includes spacious leather seats with leg and footrests, 13.3-inch HD screens, in-seat charging, plush pillows and blankets, and regionally inspired dining options served on fine china with a curated beverage selection. The aircraft also features Emirates' refreshed inflight entertainment system, ice, offering over 6,500 channels, including a wide selection of Urdu movies, TV shows, and music.",
