More than 50 housing and commercial projects from Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, and other major cities were showcased. A large number of overseas Pakistanis, businessmen, and community leaders attended the event. The expo was inaugurated by Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) President Sardar Tahir Mahmood, along with Pakistan Business Forum Saudi Arabia President Aqeel Arain and other dignitaries. Speaking on the occasion, Sardar Tahir Mahmood congratulated organizer Imran Khattak for hosting a successful event and said that Pakistan's real estate sector offers safe and profitable investment opportunities. \"Pakistan is moving fast toward a digital era, which will make business and investment even easier,\" he added.
