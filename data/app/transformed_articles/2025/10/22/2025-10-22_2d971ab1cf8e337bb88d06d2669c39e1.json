According to the press on Wednesday, \"AIOU has officially started the process of dispatching textbooks to hundreds of thousands of students enrolled in the Matric, F.A. and Associate Degree programs for the Autumn Semester 2025.\" \"Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Nasir Mahmood has issued strict directives to all departments of the university to ensure that academic activities are completed on time so that no student faces any delay,\" it added. Following that, the dispatch of textbooks began immediately after the completion of the admission process, it emphasized. Regarding book dispatch, the university has introduced a \"computerized tracking system\" through which students can track their books via the CMS (Course Management System) and Pakistan Post's e-portal, it noted. According to the Director of Admissions, Syed Zia-ul-Hasnain, textbooks for students of Matric, FA and Associate Degree programs were being sent via post, while books for other programmes were made available on the university's official website.
