    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 22 (APP):The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with support from the German Government through GIZ, has launched its first-ever Social Protection Strategy, marking a milestone in strengthening inclusive, rights-based, and resilient social protection systems in the province. Organized by the Public Policy and Social Protection Reforms Unit (PP&SPRU) under the Sustainable Development Unit (SDU) of the Planning and Development Department in Peshawar, the event brought together senior officials from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and the Federal Government, along with representatives of development partners, academia, and civil society. The launch served as a platform for dialogue on implementation frameworks, long-term impact, and inteprovincial collaboration. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Social Protection Strategy 2025-2030 provides an actionable roadmap to operationalize the province's Social Protection Policy 2022, said a newa release. It envisions a coordinated system that integrates diverse welfare programs and links social protection with disaster risk management, gender equality, and livelihood promotion. Developed with the support of German Development Cooperation through GIZ and FCDO, the Strategy aims to position Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a national leader in adaptive and people-centered social protection. Speaking at the launch, Muhammad Nadir Khan Rana, Special Secretary, Planning and Development Department, emphasized that social protection is not merely a moral responsibility but an investment in human capital and social stability. \"In an era of economic uncertainty and climate risks, resilience at the individual and community level is essential,\" he noted. Maria Jose Poddey, Country Director, GIZ Pakistan, termed the strategy \"a landmark step toward a more inclusive and resilient society,\" adding that it reflects \"strong political commitment and a shared vision to make social protection responsive, data-driven, and adaptive to climate and economic challenges.\" Muhammad Taufique, Additional Secretary, Planning and Development Department, highlighted that the initiative signifies the province's shift from fragmented welfare schemes to an institutionalized system. \"By establishing the Social Protection Authority and harmonizing data through a unified registry, we are embedding accountability and coordination into governance,\" he said. Muhammad Khalid Zaman, Director General, SDU, described the strategy as \"a testament to effective partnerships and shared vision.\" He emphasized that the next phase would focus on implementation to deliver measurable impact for the poorest and most vulnerable households. Kamran Khan, Project Director, PP&SPRU, underscored the Strategy's technological and data-driven focus, including tools such as the Provincial Socio-Economic Registry and unified payment systems to ensure transparent and efficient service delivery. In her closing remarks, Ms. Johanna Knoess, Head of Project, Adaptive Social Protection and Social Health Protection at GIZ Pakistan, commended the provincial government's leadership and vision. \"Rooted in dignity, inclusion, and resilience, this Strategy sets a model for other provinces to follow,\" she said. The ceremony concluded with appreciation for all stakeholders who contributed to developing the Strategy. With the planned establishment of a Social Protection Authority, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is set to transform its social protection landscape through coordinated governance and improved service delivery.",
