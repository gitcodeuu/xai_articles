    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 22 (APP):The District & Sessions Court of Islamabad on Wednesday postponed the hearing of the case against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for allegedly threatening a woman judge during a public gathering. Civil Judge Mureed Abbas adjourned the proceedings until November 5, citing the non-receipt of a response from the Islamabad High Court to an earlier letter. The court deferred arguments from both sides and said the case would move forward in light of the High Court's reply. The case was registered at Margalla Police Station, accusing the PTI founder of making threatening remarks about a woman judge while addressing a rally in Islamabad. At the next hearing, the court is expected to review the High Court's response before deciding on the future course of the trial.",
