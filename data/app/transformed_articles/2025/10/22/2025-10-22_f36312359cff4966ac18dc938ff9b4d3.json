    "article_body": "LAHORE, Oct 22 (APP):Punjab Counter Narcotics Force (CNF) Director General Brigadier/Commander Mazhar Iqbal has said that 45 per cent of drugs consumed in Pakistan are used within Punjab, underscoring the urgent need for a dedicated provincial body to counter the menace. He was addressing students at Government College University (GCU) Lahore on the topic \"The Establishment of the Counter Narcotics Force and the Role of Educational Institutions in Combating Drug Abuse\" here on Wednesday. Brigadier Mazhar Iqbal informed that the Punjab Counter Narcotics Force, established after the 18th Constitutional Amendment, has so far conducted more than 90 successful operations, seizing over 13 tons of narcotics worth around Rs.115 million and arresting several smugglers involved in organized networks. He said that 21 federal and provincial agencies are currently engaged in anti-narcotics operations in Pakistan, but CNF Punjab is the first autonomous provincial force legally empowered to conduct independent operations. The DG highlighted that social media and modern technology were now being misused for drug trafficking, including through drone-based deliveries, which the Force is actively monitoring. Brigadier Mazhar Iqbal lauded Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif for introducing practical and result-oriented measures to make Punjab drug-free. Under her directives, a comprehensive provincial strategy has been developed to ensure interdepartmental coordination among CNF Punjab, Police, Social Welfare, Population Welfare, and other relevant departments. The DG said that the growing presence of drugs in educational institutions is an alarming trend that requires collective efforts by teachers, parents, and administrators. \"Unless every member of society contributes, effective control over narcotics will remain impossible,\" he said. He urged students to play an active role in discouraging drug use and report any suspected cases through the CNF Punjab's dedicated helpline (1012). He advised parents to stay connected with their children, particularly during times of depression or stress, and urged educational institutions not to conceal drug-related incidents but to fully cooperate with the Force. The DG said CNF Punjab is pursuing a dual strategy of \"Humanitarian Rehabilitation\" and \"Social Awareness,\" working closely with the Social Welfare Department and certified rehabilitation centers for treatment and reintegration of addicts. Awareness and mental health programs have also been launched in educational institutions. Calling for media support, Brigadier Mazhar Iqbal said that protecting youth from narcotics is a shared social responsibility, and the Punjab government under Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif is fully committed to achieving this goal. On behalf of the GCU administration, Head of Department Abida Hussain assured full cooperation with CNF Punjab and stressed the need for mental health counselors and advisory systems in universities. The ceremony concluded with the exchange of commemorative shields between the university administration and the DG Punjab Counter Narcotics Force.",
