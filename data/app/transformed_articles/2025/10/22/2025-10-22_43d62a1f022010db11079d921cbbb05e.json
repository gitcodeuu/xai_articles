    "article_body": "PESHAWAR, Oct 22 (APP): The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has formed a special committee on Wednesday to investigate the spread of dengue virus in Peshawar and identify officials responsible for negligence. The three-member committee, led by MPA Samiullah, has been directed to submit its report to Chief Minister Sohail Afridi within three days. To control the outbreak, teams have been constituted at the tehsil level under the supervision of Assistant Commissioners. These teams include public representatives, health department officials, WSSP staff, entomologists and local government officials. An emergency has been declared in 20 high-risk union councils, with special beds allocated for dengue patients in all government hospitals. A coordination meeting was held under Commissioner Riaz Khan Mehsud, attended by deputy commissioners and health officials from Peshawar, Nowshera, Charsadda, Khyber and Mohmand districts.
