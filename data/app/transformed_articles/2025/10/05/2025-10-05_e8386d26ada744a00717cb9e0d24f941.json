    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 05 (APP): The Islamabad district administration has intensified its anti-dengue campaign, conducting fogging operations at 1,975 locations in the past 24 hours and deploying 15 new fogging machines across the city to control the spread of the virus. The Islamabad district administration has launched a large-scale anti-dengue operation in response to rising cases, expanding fumigation efforts throughout the federal capital. According to officials, 15 new fogging machines have been made operational to strengthen field activities and ensure that every dengue hotspot in the city is covered. During the last 24 hours, fumigation was carried out at 1,975 identified locations, including residential areas, parks, under-construction buildings, and open plots. The administration confirmed that fogging has also been completed in all neighborhoods where dengue-positive cases were recently reported. Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Memon directed field teams to double their daily shifts to cover all areas without delay. He instructed that no locality should remain without fogging and that field officers must ensure full implementation of dengue prevention measures in their respective zones. The Deputy Commissioner also directed Assistant Commissioners to intensify actions against causes leading to dengue larvae breeding, such as stagnant water, uncovered water tanks, and unhygienic surroundings. He stressed that strict monitoring should continue in high-risk areas, and violators of dengue safety standards should face legal action. As part of enforcement efforts, 31 individuals were arrested across the city for failing to comply with dengue Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The arrests were made during inspections of commercial areas, construction sites, and workshops where preventive measures were ignored. Officials said that the administration is coordinating closely with the health department to ensure timely fogging, larvicidal spray, and public awareness in vulnerable areas. Field teams have been directed to carry out door-to-door inspections, eliminate breeding sources, and educate residents about preventive steps. DC Memon appealed to citizens to strictly follow dengue SOPs by keeping their surroundings clean, draining stagnant water, and covering water containers. He said that public cooperation is essential for the success of the anti-dengue campaign and urged residents to immediately report mosquito breeding sites or suspected cases to the administration's helpline. The district administration has also mobilized sanitation and health teams to work in coordination with union councils to monitor water bodies, construction zones, and green belts. Daily reports are being compiled to track progress and identify new high-risk areas. Officials added that continuous monitoring and community participation are key to reducing dengue cases in Islamabad. The administration plans to maintain intensified fogging operations and enforcement drives until the threat subsides. The anti-dengue campaign will remain active in all sectors of the capital, with special focus on high-density localities to ensure the safety and well-being of residents.",
