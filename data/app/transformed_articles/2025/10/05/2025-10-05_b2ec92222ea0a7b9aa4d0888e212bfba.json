    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 05 (APP):The Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) has announced a strict crackdown on smoke-emitting vehicles in Islamabad, set to begin November 17, in a major step to tackle worsening air pollution ahead of the smog season. The enforcement campaign will involve surprise inspections, on-the-spot emission tests, fines, and possible impoundment of violating vehicles. Muhammad Saleem Shaikh, spokesperson for the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, told APP on Sunday that the campaign is a joint initiative with Islamabad Police, Islamabad Transport Authority (ITA), and the Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP). \"Protecting ourselves, our families, and our environment from the harmful effects of air pollution and smog is a collective responsibility,\" he stressed. The crackdown comes as smog season approaches - a period marked by hazardous air quality due to a mix of vehicular emissions, industrial pollutants, and burning of waste and crop residues. Smog is known to cause serious health risks, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions. It also harms the environment by reducing visibility, damaging crops, and degrading air quality in urban areas. Under the campaign, Sheikh said vehicles will be tested at both static centres and mobile inspection points across Islamabad, including key locations such as D-Chowk near Old Parade Ground, F-9 Park, and major entry and exit routes like the Islamabad Expressway. Vehicle owners found exceeding permissible smoke emission limits will face penalties, and vehicles emitting excessive smoke may be seized immediately. The spokesperson urged all motorists to cooperate with enforcement teams and ensure their vehicles are well-maintained to meet emission standards. \"We urge citizens to avoid unnecessary use of vehicles, use public transport, ensure regular maintenance to minimise smoke emissions, and refrain from burning waste or leaves in open spaces,\" he said. Vehicle owners are also encouraged to get their vehicles tested before the crackdown begins and obtain an official clearance sticker to avoid penalties. Testing points are operational at various locations, and details can be obtained by contacting the Pak-EPA office at 051-9250713 during working hours. \"This campaign is not only about enforcement but also awareness,\" Shaikh added. \"Public education efforts are underway to encourage voluntary compliance and ensure cleaner air for Islamabad's residents.\" Vehicular emissions remain one of the top contributors to urban air pollution in Pakistan. The crackdown, part of a broader government strategy to safeguard public health and environmental quality, reflects a commitment to tackling this challenge before the smog season peaks.",
