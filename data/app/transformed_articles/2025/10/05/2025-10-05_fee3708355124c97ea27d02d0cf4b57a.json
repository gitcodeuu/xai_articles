In response to media inquiries concerning Pakistani nationals aboard the Sumud flotilla, the spokesperson, in a statement, said, \"Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health. We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, Senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.\" The ministry had previously coordinated the safe return of individuals who disembarked earlier.
