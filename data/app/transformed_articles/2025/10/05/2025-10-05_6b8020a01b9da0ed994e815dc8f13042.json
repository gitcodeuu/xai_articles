    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 05 (APP): The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has reported that the severe cyclonic storm \"SHAKTI\" over the northwest Arabian Sea has continued moving west-southwestwards over the past six hours. The system is currently centered at Latitude 21.0N and Longitude 61.8E, approximately 700 kilometers southwest of Karachi. According to the PMD, the cyclone is likely to maintain its west-southwestward track until October 6, after which it is expected to recurve eastwards over the west-central and northeast Arabian Sea within the next 24 hours and gradually weaken. Under the cyclone's influence, isolated light rain is expected in the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan. Sea conditions, however, will remain rough to very rough, accompanied by squally winds ranging from 40-50 km/hour, gusting up to 55 km/hour along the Sindh coast. The PMD has advised fishermen not to venture into the deep sea until October 5, as gale-force winds around the cyclone's center may reach 110-120 km/hour, gusting up to 135 km/hour through this afternoon. Wind intensity is expected to decrease to 80-90 km/hour, gusting to 100 km/hour, during the next 12 hours, and later drop to 50-60 km/hour, gusting up to 70 km/hour. Sea conditions are likely to remain very rough to high over the northwest and west-central Arabian Sea during the next 36 hours, and high to very high from the night of October 5 to October 7. The Cyclone Warning Center, Karachi, continues to monitor the system closely and will issue updates accordingly. Authorities and residents in coastal regions have been urged to stay alert and follow PMD advisories to ensure safety.",
