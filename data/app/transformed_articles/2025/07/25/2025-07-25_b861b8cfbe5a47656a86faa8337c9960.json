    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) here on Friday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to foster research, regional cooperation, and climate-resilient development across the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. Heads of both the organizations, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director of SDPI, and Dr. Pema Gyamtsho, Director General of ICIMOD, were present during the signing ceremony, said a press release. Speaking on the occasion, Dr Pema Gyamtsho emphasized the moral obligation to serve the HKH mountains and their communities. \"It is an honour to serve this region,\" he said, adding that \"We must ensure a safer, more secure HKH through cooperation and not hide our complacency behind regional conflicts.\" He also lauded the role of Pakistan's diplomatic leadership for promoting environmental collaboration and suggested that scientists and experts from the region should be empowered to fix the growing climate concerns and crisis. As part of the ceremony, Dr. Gyamtsho presented souvenirs to former federal minister Khurram Dastgir Khan, PM's Coordinator for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Romina Khurshid Alam, and Dr. Suleri in recognition of their leadership and commitment to regional cooperation. Highlighting the broader vision behind the MoU, Dr. Suleri stated that this renewed partnership builds on SDPI's commitment to evidence-based policymaking. \"This collaboration allows us to raise the voice of the HKH mountains on global platforms and work toward just, sustainable, and climate-resilient development in Pakistan and beyond,\" he said. Romina Khurshid Alam echoed the urgency of regional cooperation: \"After COP29, it is clear that we must act collectively. Climate change requires holistic and indigenous solutions. Our intellectual capacity gives us the power to meet this challenge.\" Former federal minister Khurram Dastgir Khan also emphasized the need for peace-building through environmental cooperation. Reflecting on past Track-II dialogues between Pakistan and India, he said, \"Climate change, glacier melt, and the environment are unanimous points of agreement. We initiated a taskforce and took the first step toward cooperation through environmental dialogue.\" He warned of dire consequences if glacial melt in the Upper Indus Basin, the world's third pole, is not managed urgently. \"Let's keep these discussions sacred, above the fray of conflict. The dream of regional peace must begin with shared environmental responsibility.\" The seven-year MoU (effective till December 2030) outlines key areas of cooperation, including joint research and evidence generation on climate risks, unplanned urbanization, youth outmigration, and air pollution, promotion of climate-resilient solutions for agriculture, energy, water, tourism, and urban planning in mountain areas, policy dialogue and cross-learning among lawmakers in HKH countries, with special focus on inclusive climate governance and adaptation strategies, global advocacy to amplify the vulnerability and needs of mountain communities at forums such as UNFCCC and COP summits.",
