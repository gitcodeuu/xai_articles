    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP): The Senate on Friday passed a resolution unanimously by strongly condemning the recent decision of the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) to approve a resolution asserting so-called Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, in brazen violation of international law, United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the Geneva Conventions. The resolution was moved by Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan on behalf of entire House. The resolution Recalled that the West Bank is internationally recognized as occupied territory and that any unilateral annexation or claim of sovereignty is a clear affront to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The House affirmed the Government and people of Pakistan's unwavering support for the just cause of Palestine and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State, in line with the relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. The House recognized that such actions by the occupying Israeli government gravely endanger peace and stability in the region and expose the expansionist and apartheid agenda of the Israeli regime. The House rejects and denounces the Israeli Parliament's resolution as illegal, illegitimate, and null and void under international law. The House demands that the international community, particularly the United Nations Security Council, take immediate and concrete action to halt Israeli expansionism and protect the rights of the Palestinian people; The Senate calls upon the Government of Pakistan to intensify diplomatic efforts in collaboration with OIC and like-minded nations to resist and reverse such unlawful attempts. The House expresses solidarity with the people of Palestine in their rightful struggle for freedom, dignity, and self-determination.",
