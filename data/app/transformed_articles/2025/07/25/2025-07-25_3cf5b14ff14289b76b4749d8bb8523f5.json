    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):The Chief Justice of Pakistan Mr. Justice Yahya Afridi has underscored the urgent need to humanize judicial reforms by recognizing the emotional, psychological, and institutional pressures faced by judges, particularly at the district level. \"A judge who is institutionally supported is better able to be fair, focused, and effectively responsive,\" he remarked, affirming his unwavering commitment to ensure dignity, protection, and institutional support for the judiciary. The Chief Justice said this while delivering his keynote address at the National Symposium, with reference to the International Day for Judicial Wellbeing. The symposium was held Friday at the Federal Judicial Academy, here, under the theme \"The Human Dimension of Responsive Justice.\" Chief Justice Afridi outlined a series of judicial reform initiatives led through the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee, including the establishment of Model Criminal Trial Courts, timelines for speedy disposal of civil and criminal matters, development of a Professional Excellence Index, and formulation of ethical guidelines for the use of Artificial Intelligence in the judiciary. Special focus was placed on the wellbeing of the district judiciary, with reforms addressing extraneous influence, performance evaluation, standardized recruitment, parity in service terms, and enhanced access to international exposure. In a promising development, he announced forthcoming Memorandum of Understanding with the Supreme Court of China and the Constitutional Court of Turkiye for judicial cooperation, including the exchange of judicial officers. The event brought together judges of the superior and district judiciary, legal experts, development partners, and institutional stakeholders for a landmark dialogue on judicial wellbeing in Pakistan. Justice Wiqar Ahmad (Peshawar High Court), Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir (Islamabad High Court), Justice Iqbal Ahmed Kasi (High Court of Balochistan), Justice Jawad Akbar Sarwana (High Court of Sindh), and Justice Abher Gul Khan (Lahore High Court), along with the Registrars of the High Courts and Directors General of the judicial academies, served as esteemed panelists during the symposium. The symposium concluded with the unanimous adoption of the Islamabad Declaration on Judicial Wellbeing, calling judicial wellbeing a \"structural imperative\" for a responsive and sustainable justice system. The Declaration affirms the need to embed judicial wellbeing in all areas of reform-case management, digital integration, infrastructure, and staffing-while fostering a culture of empathy, collegiality, and institutional care. The Declaration urges stakeholders at the national and provincial levels to integrate judicial wellbeing into policy and training and calls upon development partners to collaborate in the design and implementation of a National Judicial Wellbeing Framework. The Chief Justice paid tribute to the silent strength of the judiciary and concluded with a resolute pledge: \"This day is not just a tribute-it is a promise. You are not alone. The entire institution stands behind you.\"",
