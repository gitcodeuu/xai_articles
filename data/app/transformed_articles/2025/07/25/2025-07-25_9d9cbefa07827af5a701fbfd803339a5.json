In his concluding remarks, the Executive Director of the Academy, Sultan Nasir, stated that as per tradition, the Academy holds this solemn event every Muharram-ul-Haram to pay tribute to the martyrs of Karbala. He added that this year the event was slightly delayed due to renovation and restoration activities at the Sheikh Ayaz Conference Hall. He thanked the distinguished guests and the audience for taking the time to attend the event. A large number of poets paid poetic homage to the martyrs of Karbala through salaam, manqabat, and elegiac poems.
