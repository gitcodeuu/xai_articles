    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):Chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on Federal Education and Professional Training, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt, on Friday chaired a significant meeting, focused on key legislative proposals and educational reforms aimed at enhancing quality, accessibility, and inclusivity across Pakistan's education system. The meeting began by considering the private member bill titled \"The Federal Supervision of Curricula, Textbooks, and Maintenance of Standards of Education (Amendment) Bill 2024,\" said a press release. Senator Bushra emphasized the importance of addressing sensitive topics like reproductive health in a responsible and age-appropriate manner, stressing the necessity of parental involvement. While acknowledging some reservations, she stated that the majority of members viewed the bill as timely and essential. With six votes in favor and two against, the bill was approved by the committee. Senators Afnan Ullah Khan, Syed Masroor Ahsan, Ashraf Ali Jatoi, Fawzia Arshad, and Rahat Jamali supported the bill. Senators Kamran Murtaza and Falak Naz opposed it, citing cultural sensitivities, while Senator Khalida Ateeb suggested limiting its application to secondary education. The committee was also briefed on the case of Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU) law students affected by academic transition issues. Members were informed that most concerns had been addressed and exam schedules would resume by September 1. Chairperson Butt reiterated the committee's commitment in ensuring timely accommodations for the affected students. In discussions on disability inclusion in private schools under ICT, the committee called for strengthened infrastructure, such as accessible transportation and hearing support services. Senator Bushra proposed integrating mandatory hearing screenings into newborn vaccination cards to support early detection of disabilities. The Ministries of Health and Education were directed to collaborate and submit a joint report. The committee also reviewed the School Milk Program, which aims to combat child malnutrition. Concerns were raised over quality, sugar content, lactose intolerance, and real-time delivery monitoring. Officials reported initial success in pilot districts, but the committee urged a thorough review of its nutritional impact and sustainability, particularly in light of rising childhood health issues. Additional discussion included accessible transport for students with disabilities, designated parking, and improving coordination between federal education institutions. The committee expressed concern over persistent administrative challenges, especially at institutions like Federal Urdu University, and called for a standardized model for better governance across universities. In attendance were Senators Kamran Murtaza, Afnan Ullah Khan, Syed Masroor Ahsan, Ashraf Ali Jatoi, Fawzia Arshad, Falak Naz, Rahat Jamali, Khalida Ateeb, and Sarmad Ali, along with the Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training, the Secretary of the Ministry, and senior officials from relevant departments.",
