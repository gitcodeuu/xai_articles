    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):National University of Modern Languages (NUML) has signed two key Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the TEU Professional Development Centre (TEUPDC) and Azaad Media Academy to strengthen practical learning and enhance employability among its students. The MoUs aim to bridge the gap between academia and industry by offering professional training, short courses, and real-world media experience to students. The agreements were formalized at NUML's Islamabad campus, with Director General NUML Brigadier Shahzad Munir signing both deals on behalf of the university. The first partnership, with TEUPDC, focuses on equipping students with in-demand professional skills through targeted training and industry-aligned short courses. Brigadier (R) Muzaffar ul Hassan, Executive Director of TEUPDC, signed the agreement alongside DG NUML. The collaboration is positioned as a model for public-private partnerships that address Pakistan's growing need for job-ready graduates. \"This initiative is about more than just training-it's about empowering our youth with the tools they need to succeed in a competitive job market,\" said Brigadier Munir. \"We are committed to aligning our academic programs with real-world demands.\" In a separate agreement, NUML joined hands with Azaad Media Academy to offer internship opportunities to students enrolled in the university's Media and Communication Studies Program. The collaboration was formalized by Murtaza Solangi, Patron-in-Chief of the Academy and a veteran media professional. Through this partnership, students will gain hands-on experience in areas such as journalism, broadcasting, digital storytelling, and the use of Artificial Intelligence in contemporary media practices. Solangi emphasized the importance of practical exposure in media education: \"The future of journalism is evolving rapidly. Our partnership with NUML will prepare the next generation of media professionals to meet those changes head-on with skill and confidence.\" Both agreements reflect NUML's broader vision of integrating practical training with academic learning, helping students transition more smoothly into the professional world. The university is increasingly focusing on industry collaborations as a way to stay ahead of shifting job market dynamics and technological trends. The initiatives are expected to launch in the upcoming academic semester, with joint training modules and internship placements rolling out in phases.",
