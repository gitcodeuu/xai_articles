    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):: Pakistan is witnessing a disturbing surge in cloudburst incidents, particularly in vulnerable regions such as Gilgit-Baltistan, Chitral, Swat, and densely populated urban centers like Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has flagged this trend, linking it to escalating climate change impacts. A cloudburst is an extreme weather event marked by torrential rainfall, over 100 millimeters falling in under an hour. These violent downpours often unleash flash floods, trigger landslides, and wreak havoc on infrastructure, agriculture, and communities. Experts warn that the increasing frequency and intensity of cloudbursts are a direct consequence of global climate disruption. Speaking to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), Muhammad Irfan Virk, Director of the National Weather Forecast Centre at PMD, cautioned that a spell of heavy rainfall is expected in the coming days. While he noted that there is currently no immediate threat of a cloudburst, he urged heightened vigilance. Virk advised the public, especially tourists, to avoid traveling to mountainous areas during this period. \"In the event of a cloudburst, people must immediately evacuate to safer locations,\" he emphasized. He also strongly discouraged proximity to rivers and streams and recommended that residents near riverbanks consider temporary relocation. Households with fragile rooftops were urged to ensure proper drainage systems are in place to prevent waterlogging. Additionally, farmers were advised to revise crop planning to mitigate agricultural losses. Dr. Ghulam Abbas, a professor of bio-sciences at COMSATS University Islamabad, provided insight into the meteorological mechanics behind cloudbursts. He explained that rising global temperatures allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture. When this vapor is suddenly released, it results in an explosive downpour. He warned that regions including Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Chitral, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Rawalpindi are at heightened risk of increasingly frequent and severe cloudbursts in the future. A complex web of factors-global warming, erratic monsoon patterns, rampant deforestation, and unregulated urban sprawl, has amplified the devastation caused by these events. Not only has the likelihood of cloudbursts increased, but the land's natural capacity to absorb excess water has also significantly diminished. Cloudbursts are not exclusive to Pakistan. Other mountainous regions around the world, such as parts of India, Nepal, China, and the United States, have faced similar catastrophes. India's 2013 Uttarakhand cloudburst claimed more than 5,000 lives. Pakistan has seen repeated flooding in Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral, while China's Gansu Province suffered over 1,100 deaths in 2010. Even U.S. states like Arizona and Colorado have experienced deadly flash floods resulting from localized cloudbursts. To counter this growing threat, experts stress the urgent need to enhance early warning systems through advanced radar, satellite surveillance, and real-time public alerts. Strengthening infrastructure, especially drainage systems and flood defenses, is also vital. Moreover, restoring forests, enforcing land-use regulations, and embedding climate resilience into national development planning are essential long-term strategies. As cloudbursts grow more frequent and destructive, Pakistan faces a critical turning point. Combating this escalating threat demands an integrated, climate-resilient response, backed by robust national planning and reinforced through international collaboration, to protect lives, livelihoods, and vital infrastructure.",
