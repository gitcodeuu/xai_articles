    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):Two students, supported by the Benazir Taleemi Wazaif (BTW) initiative have secured top positions in the recent matriculation examinations, defying all odds and emerging as symbols of hope for millions. Maryam Bibi and Momina Fatima, both residents of Multan and beneficiaries of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), have brought immense pride to their families and communities. Maryam Bibi clinched the first position with an outstanding score of 1164 marks, while Momina Fatima stood third with 1139 marks. Their success stories are rooted in the transformative impact of the Benazir Taleemi Wazaif, a flagship initiative under BISP, which provides conditional cash stipends to encourage school enrollment and attendance among children from low-income households. The mothers of Maryam and Momina credited the educational stipends with playing a pivotal role in their daughters' achievements. They expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government for enabling their daughters to pursue education with dignity and determination. \"This support kept us going,\" said the mother of Maryam Bibi. \"It was not just about the money, it was a sign that someone believed in our children's future.\" The success of these students underscores the importance of sustained investment in human capital, particularly through targeted social safety nets. The Benazir Taleemi Wazaif initiative is currently benefiting millions of children, with a strong focus on ensuring retention and performance, especially among girls who face additional socio-economic challenges.",
