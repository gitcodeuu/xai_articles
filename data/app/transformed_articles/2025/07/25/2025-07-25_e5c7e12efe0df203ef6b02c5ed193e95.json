    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Friday informed the Senate that no literary, cultural and academic institutions were being closed rather additional expenditures were being curtailed to ensure greater transparency. Responding to a Calling Attention Notice raised by Sarmad Ali regarding the proposed closure and merger of several prominent literary, academic, and cultural institutions, the minister clarified that the government had not abolished any ministry. He said that only some recommendations were made to enhance transparency. Some ministries, such as the Aviation Division, were merged with the Ministry of Defence, he said. Later, speaking in the House, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui said he had raised the issue along with the Leader of the Opposition and the PPP. He said that the Prime Minister had also taken notice of the matter, and the PM House had issued a statement clarifying that no such institution was being closed.",
