    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):In a bid to promote peace and tolerance among Pakistan's youth, the European Union, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) and Human Resource Development Network (HRDN) have joined forces to launch the Youth Engagement and Resilience Initiative (YERI). Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi attended the event as the chief guest. He highlighted the crucial role of youth in shaping Pakistan's future, said a press release. The Governor stressed that instead of polarizing young people, it's essential to harmonize them to support each other, fostering a culture of peace, tolerance, and unity. \"By doing so, the youth can become a powerful force for positive change, working together to build a brighter future for the country,\" he added. He said, \"Cultural exchange and youth determination to promote peace is critical for increasing tolerance in society and Pakistan's future is in the hands of these young people.\" Robeela Bangash, CEO of HRDN said \"YERI represents a long-term investment in peace building through inclusion, empowerment, and innovation-led by the youth, for the youth.\" The event showcased the project's achievements, success stories, and transformative impact on young communities in vulnerable regions, featuring a Sufi dance performance, live testimonies from trained youth leaders, and a presentation by the YERI Project Manager. By empowering young people and providing them with the necessary skills and knowledge, YERI is helping to build a more resilient and peaceful society. It is worth mentioning that YERI has empowered over 130 Youth Champions across four high-priority districts - Swat, Bahawalpur, Mirpur Khas, and Turbat. The project focuses on building youth-led resilience through inclusive, sustained engagement, and has reignited dialogue, trust, and resilience within communities.",
