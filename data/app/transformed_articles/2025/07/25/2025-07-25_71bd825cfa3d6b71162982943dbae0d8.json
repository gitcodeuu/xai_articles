    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has intensified its crackdown on illegal encroachments in Islamabad, particularly structures built over natural stormwater drains (nullahs), warning that such constructions pose severe flooding risks and will be demolished without exception. The announcement came during a high-level meeting held at the CDA Headquarters, chaired by Chairman CDA and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa on Friday. According to the briefing, enforcement teams have already begun sealing and demolishing illegal structures built over nullahs, in accordance with directives from Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. The campaign aims to reclaim government land from illegal occupants and prevent life-threatening scenarios during Islamabad's increasingly intense monsoon rains. \"Buildings constructed over nullahs without a hydraulic study or CDA approval are not only illegal but highly dangerous. These structures could collapse during a major flood,\" said Chairman Randhawa, citing heavy rainfall this monsoon season-the highest since 2001-as a serious wake-up call. Residents and commercial property owners have been urged to voluntarily remove all encroachments from stormwater channels. \"If not removed voluntarily, these structures will be sealed, declared hazardous, and legal action will be initiated. The responsibility will lie entirely with the encroachers,\" Randhawa warned. In addition to enforcement, the CDA is implementing preventive measures to stop future encroachments. A permanent monitoring system will be established, utilizing drone surveillance and Google Earth mapping to track reclaimed land. The authority also announced the digitization of layout plans, the No Objection Certificate (NOC) process, and fee payments for map approvals through a new cashless system. \"We are digitizing our One Window Facilitation Center and computerizing land records to enhance transparency and service delivery,\" said the Chairman, adding that these reforms will also help curb fraudulent construction practices and improve public access to services. The citywide anti-encroachment drive follows repeated flooding incidents in Islamabad's residential and commercial sectors. Experts have warned that unregulated construction over nullahs obstructs natural water flow, leading to urban flooding and potential loss of life. The CDA reiterated its commitment to carry out indiscriminate operations across all sectors of the city and urged citizens to cooperate in maintaining lawful development and environmental safety.",
