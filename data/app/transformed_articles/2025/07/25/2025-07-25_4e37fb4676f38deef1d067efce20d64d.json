    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, July 25 (APP): The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Friday officially announced that the crescent for the Islamic month of Safar 1447 AH was not sighted anywhere in the country. According to a formal notification issued by the ministry, the decision was made based on the recommendations of the Zonal Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, which convened its monthly moon-sighting meeting in the federal capital. As a result, the 1st of Safar 1447 AH will now begin on Sunday, July 27, 2025. The announcement comes in line with the Islamic lunar calendar tradition, which relies on physical moon sighting to determine the beginning of each month.",
