    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP): The Senate of Pakistan on Friday extended formal appreciation for the Presidential Address to the joint session of Parliament, delivered on March 10 of the current year. The motion of thanks was moved by Barrister Aqeel Malik, Minister of State for Law and Justice, on behalf of Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhary, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs. The motion sought the House's consent to record its sincere gratitude for the President's Address, acknowledging its significance in framing national priorities and parliamentary discourse. In speeches delivered during the motion of thanks, treasury members hailed the president's address as \"a strategic road-map for a resilient and prosperous Pakistan. Senators from both sides of the aisle addressed multiple issues, raised by the president in his address to both Houses of Parliament, marking the commencement of the new parliamentary year. Senator Waqar Mehdi underscored the unprecedented milestone achieved by President Asif Ali Zardari, the only individual in Pakistan's history to be elected to the presidency twice. Mehdi underscored President Zardari's reconciliation-driven approach, recalling his voluntary transfer of presidential powers to Parliament through the 18th Amendment. He also noted Zardari's endurance through 12.5 years of imprisonment, culminating in acquittals by the courts. Touching on recent government decisions, Mehdi said canal construction had been suspended following a movement, spearheaded by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Meanwhile, Senator Saifullah Abro voiced concern over rising sugar prices, warning of deepening public hardship and calling for urgent corrective and remedial measures. Senator Masroor Ahsan extended birthday felicitations to President Asif Ali Zardari. Ahsan lauded the speech for its inclusive focus on farmers, laborers, and other marginalized segments of society, emphasizing the administration's continued commitment to social equity and economic resilience.",
