    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 04 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, paid a visit to the CDA Nursery on Friday to inspect the ongoing transformation of the facility into the 'Gardenia Hub'-a landmark horticulture project aimed at enhancing Islamabad's green infrastructure, promoting environmental sustainability, and boosting recreational spaces for residents. During the visit, Chairman Randhawa was accompanied by Member Engineering, Member Environment and other senior officials of the CDA. The delegation reviewed the upgradation work currently underway at the nursery, which is being redesigned as a modern horticultural complex. Randhawa directed concerned departments to expedite the construction of contemporary flower shops that would not only add to the city's visual appeal but also provide a vibrant space for residents to engage with nature. \"These shops will serve both aesthetic and commercial purposes, turning the area into a recreational hub for families,\" he noted. A key component of the project is the development of advanced, climate-controlled greenhouses to ensure optimal plant growth in all weather conditions. These facilities will also support research initiatives aimed at enhancing plant resilience and biodiversity. In a bid to promote innovation in plant cultivation, the Gardenia Hub will also house a state-of-the-art Tissue Culture Laboratory. This lab will use modern biotechnology to propagate new and rare plant species, potentially expanding the range of flora available for urban landscaping and conservation. The CDA also plans to establish a dedicated floral display area showcasing both seasonal and off-season flowers. This space will be open to the public and is intended to foster greater community interest in gardening and environmental stewardship. Highlighting the broader impact of the initiative, Randhawa stated that the project aligns with the CDA's green agenda and reflects its commitment to sustainable urban development. \"The Gardenia Hub is not just a beautification effort-it's about creating jobs, supporting research, and setting new benchmarks for urban horticulture,\" he said. He instructed officials to ensure that all construction and landscaping work adheres to international standards and is completed within the specified timeline. \"We want this to be a showcase project that reflects Islamabad's identity as a modern, eco-conscious capital,\" Randhawa emphasized. The Gardenia Hub, once completed, is expected to serve as a model for similar initiatives in other cities, reinforcing Islamabad's reputation for greenery, innovation, and quality of life.",
