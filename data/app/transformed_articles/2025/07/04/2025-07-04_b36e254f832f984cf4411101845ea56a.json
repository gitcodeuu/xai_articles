    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 04 (APP): Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police on Friday held a flag march in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies to demonstrate their commitment to maintaining peace and promoting unity during the holy month of Muharram. A police spokesperson told APP that the flag march was led by SSP Operations Muhammad Shoaib Khan, and covered various areas of the city. SSP Shoaib said personnel from the ICT Police and other law enforcement agencies participated in the march, which started from the Pakistan Sports Complex and culminated at the same point after passing through different routes in the federal capital. SSP said the purpose of the flag march was to reinforce the message of peace, religious harmony, and the resolve of the Islamabad Police to ensure foolproof security arrangements during Muharram. He said all necessary measures were being taken for the security of Majalis and processions throughout the city. SSP Shoaib said strict implementation of the code of conduct and standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued for Muharram had been directed. He said special monitoring of social media was also underway and legal action would be taken against those spreading sectarian hatred or inciting religious discord. SSP Shoaib said no one would be allowed to take the law into their own hands, and violators would face strict legal consequences. SSP expressed hope that the peace-loving citizens of Islamabad would continue to fully cooperate with the police and administration to maintain law and order in the city.",
