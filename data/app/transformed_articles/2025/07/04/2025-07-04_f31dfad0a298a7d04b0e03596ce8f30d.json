On July 4, 2025, Akram moderated and spoke in a panel titled \"Economic Inequality and Governance,\" part of the broader track on \"Economic Development: New Pathways and Future Prospects for the Global South.\" His contributions provided valuable insights into inclusive growth, digital economies, and legal frameworks in the Global South. In his award-winning presentation, Akram emphasized the digital economy's potential to drive inclusive growth in the Global South. He highlighted the necessity of combining technological advancements with robust policy, infrastructure, and human capital development.

The 4th Tsinghua Area Studies Forum was structured into several thematic panels, each designed to address distinct yet interconnected facets of the Global South.

Sessions delved into geopolitical conflicts and regional integration and cooperation. The second panel covered trade, investment, global value chains, transformation of the informal economy, sustainable development, industrial policy, and economic growth.
