    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 04 (APP): Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police have deployed modern mobile control rooms to oversee the security of 181 Muharram processions, assisting and guiding over 16,000 deployed personnel across the federal capital. A police spokesperson told APP on Friday that these mobile units have been equipped with integrated communication systems and are linked with the central control centre to ensure real-time monitoring and rapid coordination during the religious gatherings. He said the mobile control rooms will accompany the main processions throughout their routes and help enforce the security plan in coordination with other law enforcement and intelligence agencies. He said federal ministers, Chief Commissioner Islamabad, and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi visited the mobile control room on Wednesday to inspect its technological setup and review security arrangements on the ground. He said the ICT Police have finalized a comprehensive security plan for Muharram under the special direction of senior leadership, ensuring that all gatherings and processions are covered through surveillance, on-ground deployment, and mobile command support. He said the new system enhances situational awareness and command efficiency for field officers, enabling a timely response to any emergency situation.",
