    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 04 (APP):Freedom Gate Prosperity (FGP) hosted the National Climate Dialogue 2025 to explore actionable responses to Pakistan's escalating climate challenges. The event brought together climate experts, legal professionals, policymakers, and youth advocates to discuss sustainable solutions and develop a unified approach to inclusive climate action, said a press release here on Friday. Shafqat Aziz, Head of FGP's Climate Change Division, welcomed participants during the opening session and outlined the dialogue's agenda. His remarks were followed by a passionate youth perspective delivered by Saaremeen Fatima, a young climate activist advocating for intergenerational climate responsibility. The dialogue served as a vital platform to bridge gaps between governance, legal reform, media, and grassroots resilience. Its aim was to forge a collective roadmap for sustainable and people-centered climate responses. Addressing a session on heatwaves, resilience, and agricultural adaptation, Mohsin Leghari, former Punjab Minister for Irrigation and Finance and a noted climate advocate, emphasized that climate adaptation must be rooted in data-driven strategies, farmer inclusion, and risk-aligned agricultural planning. \"Building resilience is no longer optional - it's a survival imperative,\" he said. Joining virtually, Ammara Durrani, a senior development policy expert, stressed the importance of people-centric climate solutions. \"Climate action must empower youth and women in green economic activity, enable district-level media as the voice of the people, and restore the ethic of care within our ecosystems,\" she noted. In his remarks, Muhammad Anwar, CEO of FGP, reaffirmed the organization's grassroots commitment: \"FGP stands ready to translate today's insights into collaborative, community-rooted action, especially for those most vulnerable to climate impacts.\" Dr. Muhammad Rafiq, Member of the Climate Council, Government of Pakistan, shared insights on governance gaps and emphasized the urgency of integrated policy execution. He underscored the importance of multi-level coordination and locally grounded climate action. Dr. Zia Ullah Ranjah, Advocate Supreme Court and Partner at Jurist Panel, highlighted the critical role of legal frameworks in ensuring climate justice. He called for the use of legal instruments and judicial mechanisms to guarantee institutional accountability and the enforcement of environmental rights. The event concluded with a vibrant open discussion, where participants expressed a collective resolve to strengthen climate resilience through collaboration, inclusive governance, and public engagement.",
