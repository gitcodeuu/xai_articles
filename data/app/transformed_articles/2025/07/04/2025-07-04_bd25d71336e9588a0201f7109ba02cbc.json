    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 04 (APP):The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) alert for northern Pakistan, warning of a heightened risk of flooding in glaciated regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to rising temperatures and an approaching weather system. According to the PMDas Research and Development Division, persistent high temperatures are accelerating snow and glacier melt, increasing the likelihood of GLOF and flash flood incidents in vulnerable valleys and surrounding areas over the current and upcoming week. The alert underscores the urgency for all relevant authorities and local communities to remain vigilant and take precautionary measures to mitigate risks and ensure public safety. The PMD urged timely preparedness and coordinated response to avoid any untoward situation amid the intensifying climate impacts in the region.",
