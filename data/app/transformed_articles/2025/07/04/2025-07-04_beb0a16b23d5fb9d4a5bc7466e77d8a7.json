In his message, the minister conveyed best wishes to the U.S. government and its people, saying, \"We share in the joy of the American people on this important day.\" He added, \"The 4th of July symbolizes the spirit of sacrifice and the greatness of democracy. Freedom is a symbol of identity, sovereignty, and human dignity.\" Praising U.S. leadership, Naqvi remarked, \"Under President Donald Trump's leadership, the U.S. has progressed on the path of development, unity, and peace. His role in promoting global peace has been exemplary.\" Expressing optimism, he said, \"We hope that longstanding international conflicts will move toward resolution during President Trump's tenure.\" He also acknowledged Trump's role during Indo-Pak tensions, calling it \"balanced, insightful, and wise,\" and said his constructive engagement will always be remembered.
