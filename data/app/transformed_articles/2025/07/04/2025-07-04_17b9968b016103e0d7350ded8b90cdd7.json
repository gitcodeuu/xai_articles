    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 04 (APP):A landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), the Prime Minister's Youth Programme (PMYP), and the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) to empower Pakistan's youth. The signing ceremony, held at OGDCL headquarters in Islamabad, was attended by senior officials from all three organizations, including Ahmed Hayat Lak, Managing Director/CEO of OGDCL, Chairman Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan of PMYP, and Chairperson Gulmina Bilal Ahmad of NAVTTC. The MoU outlines a framework to strengthen youth-focused initiatives across Pakistan, promoting vocational and technical education, enhancing employability, supporting innovation and sports programs, and encouraging environmental consciousness. The partnership aims to support skills-based education and career development, create job opportunities, and engage young people in activities such as esports, talent hunt sports programs, and volunteerism. The project initially targets 1,000 youth aged 15 to 35 from across the country, with a strong emphasis on inclusivity, regional diversity, and merit-based selection. The collaboration will also promote green initiatives on university campuses and beyond, fostering environmental stewardship among students. The heads of the three organizations highlighted the importance of this collaboration, emphasizing the need to equip young Pakistanis with the skills and platforms necessary for their personal growth and national progress. This MoU marks the beginning of a long-term collaboration between OGDCL, PMYP, and NAVTTC, aiming to foster a more skilled, engaged, and environmentally conscious generation that will contribute meaningfully to Pakistan's sustainable development and national unity.",
