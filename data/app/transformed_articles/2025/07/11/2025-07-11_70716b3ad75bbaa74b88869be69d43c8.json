Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the case, the court also terminated the objections of the Registrar's Office on the petition filed for the recovery of Saeedullah. During the hearing on the petition with the objection of the Registrar's Office yesterday, lawyers Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chathaa appeared in the court on behalf of the petitioner Jahanzeb Khan and took the position that a passerby can also file an enforced disappearance petition.
