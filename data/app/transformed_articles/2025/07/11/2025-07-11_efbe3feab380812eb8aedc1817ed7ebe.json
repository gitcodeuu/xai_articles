    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, July 11 (APP): More than 270 Pakistani students set to pursue higher education in the United States gathered this week in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi for a series of pre-departure orientations organized by EducationUSA at the United States Educational Foundation in Pakistan (USEFP). The annual sessions aimed to prepare students - bound for undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs at US institutions - for their academic journeys and cultural transitions. The orientations covered a wide range of topics including classroom dynamics, campus life, resources for international students, and adapting to American culture. Parents, school counselors, and US university alumni also joined the sessions to provide valuable insights and support. According to the Institute of International Education's 2024 Open Doors Report, nearly 11,000 Pakistani students were enrolled in US institutions last year, marking an all-time high and reflecting an 8.1 percent increase from the previous year. \"Pakistan is home to thousands of alumni of US colleges and universities,\" said Lisa Swenarski, Minister Counselor for Public Diplomacy at the US Embassy in Islamabad. \"We are extremely proud to support Pakistani students through EducationUSA's advising services, which enable talented and motivated individuals to experience life-changing education in the United States. These students enrich our campuses and return to Pakistan as future leaders.\" The pre-departure orientation marks the final step in EducationUSA's comprehensive advising process, which supports hundreds of students each year in applying to US colleges and universities. The event also served as a celebratory send-off for the departing cohort. \"A US education has the power to transform lives,\" said USEFP Executive Director Dr. Peter Moran. \"Our EducationUSA advisers, many of whom are US alumni themselves, equip students with the tools they need to thrive. We are confident these students will not only succeed in the United States but will also return to contribute meaningfully to Pakistan and the world.\" EducationUSA is the US government's official source of information on US higher education, offering free, accurate, and up-to-date guidance to prospective students. In Pakistan, it operates under USEFP - a binational commission established in 1950 by the governments of Pakistan and the United States. USEFP also manages the Fulbright Program, the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship, and other competitive academic exchange opportunities for Pakistani students.",
