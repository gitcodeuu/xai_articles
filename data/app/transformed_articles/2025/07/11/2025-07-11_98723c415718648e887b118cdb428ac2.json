    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP):Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi has strongly condemned the brutal terrorist attack in Sardhakah, Balochistan, where innocent passengers were pulled off buses and mercilessly killed. In a statement issued on Friday, Hanif Abbasi termed the killing of nine innocent people as a \"barbaric act against humanity.\" \"The terrorists of Fitnatul-Hindustan deliberately targeted passengers based on their identity, singling out and killing those from Punjab,\" he said. The minister described the incident as a cowardly and sectarian act aimed at striking at the heart of national unity. \"This heinous attack is a deep blow to our national solidarity,\" he added. Expressing solidarity with the victims' families, he said, \"We share the grief of the bereaved families. Our hearts are heavy and our eyes are filled with tears.\" He prayed Almighty Allah to elevate their ranks in the hereafter and grant patience to their families. Calling the terrorists of Fitnatul-Hindustan the worst enemies of humanity, the minister vowed that the perpetrators of this massacre would soon be brought to justice.",
