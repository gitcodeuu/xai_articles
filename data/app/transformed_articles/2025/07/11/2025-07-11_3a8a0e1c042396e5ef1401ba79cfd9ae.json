    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP): Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, Chaudhry Salik Hussain, inaugurated the newly established Business Center at F-6 Markaz, Islamabad, aimed at enhancing the welfare of industrial workers. Constructed under the Workers Welfare Fund (WWF), the center marks a significant milestone in advancing the financial sustainability of the organization. Addressing the inaugural ceremony on Friday, Chaudhry Salik Hussain announced that the revenue generated from the Business Center would be utilized for education, healthcare, housing, and other welfare services for workers and their families. Commending the dedication and efforts of WWFas leadership, he noted that the project reflects how public service and financial self-reliance can be achieved through sincerity and vision. He also lauded WWF Secretary Zulfiqar Ahmed for his progressive vision in transforming the Fund into an institution committed to serving the working class. Earlier, WWF Secretary Zulfiqar Ahmed briefed that the project was completed within the stipulated timeframe, maintaining full transparency and high standards of quality. He expressed confidence that the center is expected to generate enough revenue to recover its construction costs within a year. He further expressed hope that the Workers Welfare Fund would become a self-sustaining and profitable organization by 2030, directly benefiting industrial workers and their families. Zulfiqar Ahmed also mentioned WWFas swift progress toward digitalization, in collaboration with the Ministry of Information Technology and in line with the Government of Pakistanas directives. He said an agreement has already been signed, enabling workers and their families to check the status of their applications from home with just a single click. On the occasion, Chaudhry Salik Hussain presented commemorative shields to Secretary WWF Zulfiqar Ahmed and officers of the Works Section in recognition of their service.",
