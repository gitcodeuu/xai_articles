    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP): In a decisive push to reform and energize Pakistan's quality control infrastructure, Federal Minister for Science and Technology Khalid Hussain Magsi chaired the 35th meeting of the Board of Directors of the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA), approving a series of long-overdue measures to boost institutional performance, enhance employee welfare, and modernize core operations. The high-level meeting, held in Islamabad, was attended by key stakeholders including PSQCA Director General Rizwan Ahmed Sheikh, TDAP Executive Director Muhammad Ashraf, and Secretary PSQCA Abdul Karim Rind. With a focus on structural reforms and service efficiency, the Board endorsed several landmark decisions aimed at reshaping the authority's internal and external functioning. The key outcomes included the regularization of employees, release of pending salaries, and immediate disbursement of wages to staff in BS-01 to BS-04-steps that signal a renewed commitment to the well-being of the PSQCA workforce. The Board also approved the deployment of solar energy systems across PSQCA offices nationwide, aligning the institution with national goals of sustainability and cost-effective energy use. Furthering Pakistan's global trade objectives, the Board gave the green light to an MoU with the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), expected to facilitate smoother export processes for Pakistani food products. In another major move, the Board sanctioned the implementation of SAP software in finance and HR systems to digitalize and streamline operations. The other important decisions included approval for new vehicles to support fieldwork (pending clearance from the Finance Division's Austerity Committee), continuation of medical services under existing rules, and endorsement of a Mutual Recognition Agreement with an international automobile testing lab to strengthen standards in the auto sector. Khalid Hussain Magsi lauded the Board's proactive approach and directed all departments to ensure immediate execution of approved reforms. He emphasized the need for transparency, accountability, and results-driven governance to restore public confidence and institutional credibility.",
