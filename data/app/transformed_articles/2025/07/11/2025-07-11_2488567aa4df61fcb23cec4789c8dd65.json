    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP):Commonwealth Secretariat at Marlborough House, London has formally recognized Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) as an Accredited Organization of the Commonwealth. This prestigious accreditation places SDPI, a leading policy research think tank of Pakistan, among a select group of institutions from across the 56 member countries that contribute to the Commonwealth's mission of advancing democracy, development, and cooperation, said a press release issued here on Friday. The recognition reflects SDPI's sustained commitment to evidence-based policy research, inclusive dialogue, and sustainable development across Pakistan and the Global South. As an Accredited Organization, SDPI will now have increased opportunities to engage with the Commonwealth Secretariat, contribute to high-level dialogues, and collaborate with other member organizations on key global and regional policy issues, ranging from climate action and economic development to education, peace building, and governance. Commenting on the recognition, SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said: \"This accreditation is a testament to SDPI's impactful work over the past three decades. It reaffirms our role as a credible platform for policy innovation, South-South cooperation, and global engagement. We look forward to contributing more actively to the Commonwealth's shared vision of a fairer, more resilient, and more prosperous future.\" The accreditation also enables SDPI to participate in key Commonwealth events, including the upcoming Secretary-General's Welcome Dialogue with Accredited Organisations, scheduled to take place on July 15th in London. Founded in 1992, SDPI continues to serve as a bridge between research and policy, and its Commonwealth accreditation marks another milestone in its journey of driving sustainable development through informed dialogue and collaborative partnerships.",
