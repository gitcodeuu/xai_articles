    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP):In a significant win for women's property rights, the Federal Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment (FOSPAH) has directed Bahria Town Islamabad to restore the plot of Ms. Romana Bashir, who had been unjustly deprived of her rightful property for over four years, said in a Press Release issued here on Friday. Romana had approached FOSPAH after her allotted 7 Marla plot in Bahria Town was cancelled due to non-payment of approximately Rs. 157,000 in additional development charges. Despite having paid the full cost of the plot and 50% of the development charges, her repeated visits to the Bahria Town management yielded no results. Following a thorough review of the case, FOSPAH found that Bahria Town failed to provide any notice or opportunity of hearing before cancelling the plot; a fundamental violation of the complainant's rights. In her final order, the Federal Ombudsperson ruled that: \"The failure to pay a relatively minor amount in additional charges does not give the management the right to cancel the entire allotment without due process. Citizens must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before any such punitive action.\" Under the directions of Ms. Fauzia Viqar, Bahria Town has now allotted Ms. Romana a new plot of equivalent value in a developed sector and issued her an official allotment letter. This case highlights FOSPAH's important role in the enforcement of women's right to property under the Enforcement of Women's Property Rights Act, 2020.",
