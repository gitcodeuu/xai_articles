Despite operating under limited resources, the institution has surpassed its previous financial performance, marking the highest revenue in its 78-year history. In a statement issued on Friday, the minister described the achievement as a significant breakthrough and a testament to the dedication of railway employees. \"I salute the workers who have poured their blood and sweat into the stability of this institution,\" he said, attributing the success to their relentless efforts.

According to official figures, passenger trains contributed Rs 47.5 billion to the total revenue, while freight services earned Rs 31.5 billion. Military traffic brought in Rs 1.5 billion, other coaching services contributed Rs 3 billion, and miscellaneous sources added another Rs 9.5 billion.
