    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday granted time to federal government for submission of report to explain that why it is refusing to cooperate in the US court on Dr. Aafia's case. Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan heard the case related to release and repatriation of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui from a US jail. The court expressed strong anger over the federal government's failure to submit a report. On this occasion, lawyer Imran Shafiq appeared in the court on behalf of the petitioner, while Additional Attorney General Rashid Hafeez and others appeared in the court on behalf of the federation. During the hearing of the case, the court said that a report was sought from you regarding the reasons for refusing to cooperate in the US court on Dr. Aafia's case. If the federal government's report is not presented, I will summon the entire cabinet, Justice Ishaq said. The court said that in the month of June, it had sought a response.
