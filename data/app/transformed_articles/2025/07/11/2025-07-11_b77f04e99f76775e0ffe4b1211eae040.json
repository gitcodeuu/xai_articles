    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP): Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication, Shaza Fatima Khawaja met with Google's Regional AI Developer Ecosystem & Communities team to explore strategic collaboration in advancing Pakistan's artificial intelligence landscape. The Google team provided an overview of their developer ecosystem in the region, highlighting the contributions of Google Developer Groups (GDGs), community-based AI initiatives, and impactful platforms like Taleemabad. The discussion focused on expanding community-driven innovation and AI adoption across Pakistan. During the meeting, the Minister also had an interactive session with the N+1 team, a group of young Pakistani developers recently selected among the global top 10 in the Google Solution Challenge. The team proudly represented Pakistan at the regional showcase in the Philippines. Shaza Fatima praised their achievement, noting it as a testament to the country's emerging talent pool and the importance of nurturing such success stories through structured support and mentorship. In the wider policy discussion, the Minister emphasized the government's strategic focus on AI training across three critical domains: mainstream education (from KG to university), workforce development including freelancers, and industrial innovation. She stressed the need for inclusive access to tools such as the AI Seekho program, sandbox environments, and cloud credits. Concluding the meeting, she called for enhanced collaboration between Google and the Ministry of IT & Telecommunication (MoITT) to accelerate Pakistan's integration into the global AI ecosystem and promote equitable digital empowerment.",
