    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP): Capital Development Authority (CDA) in a bid to improve pedestrian safety and urban aesthetics, has ordered a complete survey and timely maintenance of all pedestrian bridges across Islamabad. The directive, issued by Chairman CDA and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa during a high-level meeting on Friday, includes structural repairs, overhauling, and the installation of decorative lighting on pedestrian overpasses throughout the city. A significant portion of the meeting focused on the long-awaited Parking Plaza in Blue Area. The Chairman called for its completion and full operationalization \"as soon as possible\" to ease congestion and improve accessibility for visitors to the city's commercial hub. Park upgrades also emerged as a top priority, with specific attention given to F-9 Park and Lake View Park. The Chairman emphasized installing modern lighting and enhancing facilities for families and fitness enthusiasts. \"We're not just maintaining green spaces-we're transforming them into vibrant, safe, and well-lit recreational zones,\" said Randhawa. Environmental and tourism projects were also discussed. The Chairman ordered the plantation of eco-friendly trees and instructed officials to accelerate feasibility studies for new attractions, including cable cars, theme parks, and fun fairs, aimed at promoting eco-tourism and family entertainment. On traffic management, Randhawa assured that improvement works are ongoing on key arteries such as Expressway, Margalla Road, Club Road, Park Road, and Faisal Avenue. These include road widening, lane markings, sidewalk repair, green belt development, and beautification of right-of-ways. \"Urban forest projects and roundabout renovations are being prioritized to tackle air and land pollution,\" he added. The meeting was also briefed on the city's road beautification initiative, which includes horticulture and landscaping along model highways, seasonal flower beds, wooden signboards, and the installation of aesthetically designed planters. According to CDA officials, the initiative has been \"well-received by the public.\" Finally, Randhawa instructed a complete overhaul of parks in every sector of Islamabad, covering walking tracks, swings, lighting, and plantation work. \"Every effort and resource must be channeled toward elevating Islamabad's residential, transport, sports, and recreational facilities to the highest standards,\" he concluded. Members in attendance included Member Administration and Estate Talat Mahmood, Member Engineering Syed Nafasat Raza, Member Planning Dr. Khalid Hafeez, and other senior officials from various departments, including Works, E&M, Enforcement, and DMA.",
