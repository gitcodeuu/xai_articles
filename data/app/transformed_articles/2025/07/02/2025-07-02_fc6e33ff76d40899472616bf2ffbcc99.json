Upon his arrival, a smartly turned-out contingent of Pakistan Air Force presented Guard of Honour to Lieutenant General Wiseman Simo Mbambo. During the meeting, Chief of the Air Staff emphasized the shared values and aspirations that form the foundation of the deep-rooted friendship between Pakistan and South Africa. The Air Chief reiterated PAF's commitment to bolster aerial combat capabilities of the South African Air Force through tailored training and capacity-building initiatives. Lieutenant General Wiseman Mbambo lauded PAF's robust operational readiness, its multi-domain warfare capabilities and its success in maintaining a credible deterrence posture. Recognising the shared values and interests between the two Air Forces, the South African Air Chief articulated a strong desire to further strengthen and institutionalize the formal relationship between South African Air Force and PAF. One of the central themes of the discussions was the revamping of South African Air Force's training regime.
