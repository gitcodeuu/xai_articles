    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 02 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, has directed all civic and administrative bodies in the capital to ramp up preparations for Muharram-ul-Haram and the ongoing monsoon season, with a strong emphasis on public safety, service delivery, and inter-agency coordination. Chairing a high-level meeting at CDA Headquarters on Wednesday, Randhawa outlined a series of urgent and long-term measures to address illegal constructions, ensure smooth traffic flow, improve sanitation, and enhance public facilities across Islamabad. The meeting brought together CDA Board members, senior officers of the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), Deputy Commissioner Islamabad, civil defense officials, and all Assistant Commissioners. \"The District Administration officers, especially Assistant Commissioners, must identify and resolve issues like illegal encroachments, faulty streetlights, broken roads, water shortages, and poor drainage,\" Randhawa said. \"This must be done in close coordination with the relevant CDA departments - negligence will not be tolerated.\" He directed that all major underpasses and critical locations be fitted with functional CCTV cameras connected to the Safe City surveillance system. In addition, low-lying areas must be cleared of stagnant water and drains fully cleaned to mitigate flood risks during the monsoon. A key focus of the meeting was planning for the upcoming Muharram observances. Randhawa called for foolproof security arrangements, including restored lighting on processional routes and effective traffic management to ensure public safety. On a broader note, the CDA chairman instructed officials to formulate a long-term strategy for removing encroachments, repairing infrastructure, and uplifting public spaces like parks. He also stressed the need for sustained collaboration with civil society, traders, and other stakeholders to support the city's development. \"Regular consultation and ground presence are essential,\" he said. \"CDA, MCI, DMA, and District Administration officers must lead from the front, operate transparently, and deliver results with integrity.\" The meeting concluded with a reaffirmation of the administration's zero-tolerance policy on corruption and a renewed commitment to making Islamabad a cleaner, safer, and more efficient city.",
