    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 02 (APP):Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) has introduced advanced drone technology to monitor and enforce traffic laws on the capital's busiest routes. The new system will cover major highways, starting with the Islamabad Expressway and Srinagar Highway, two key arteries that experience heavy traffic flow. Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (R) Syed Zeeshan Haider told APP that drone cameras would be deployed to oversee traffic on these main roads, allowing for real-time detection of violations. Offenders will face immediate fines as drones capture violations, marking a significant shift towards high-tech law enforcement. \"This initiative is a major step forward in our efforts to bring more discipline to Islamabad's roads,\" said CTO Haider. \"By utilizing drone surveillance, we aim to reduce violations, ease traffic congestion, and ensure the safety of all road users.\" Initially, the drone technology will focus on the Islamabad Expressway and Srinagar Highway, two critical routes prone to heavy traffic and violations. \"In the next phase, we plan to extend drone coverage to other key sectors and roads throughout the city,\" added CTO Zeeshan. The drones will not only help enforce traffic laws but will also assist in identifying areas with heavy congestion. This will allow ITP to deploy special response teams swiftly, minimizing traffic delays and improving the overall flow. \"This move is part of our broader strategy to modernize policing and ensure that traffic laws are strictly enforced,\" said CTO.",
