    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 02 (APP): Capital Development Authority (CDA) has announced a comprehensive plan to modernize its One Window Facilitation Center, introduce cashless transactions for civic services, and digitize land and financial records. The announcement came during a high-level meeting held at CDA Headquarters on Wednesday, chaired by Chairman CDA and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa. Members of the CDA Board were present, while Chairman of the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB), Faisal Yousaf, joined the meeting via video link along with his technical team. The CDA plans to roll out a cashless system enabling citizens to pay property tax, water charges, and transfer fees online. The reforms will also allow submission of building maps and layout plans digitally, aiming to centralize all civic services under one digital platform. \"This initiative will save citizens time, cut administrative costs, reduce paper-based processes, and most importantly, enhance transparency,\" said Randhawa. \"We are committed to transforming CDA into a tech-enabled, model institution for the public good.\" The modernization plan is part of a broader shift toward e-governance at CDA. According to officials, the authority is actively working on digitizing its land records and automating financial systems, moving away from outdated manual processes. The PITB, which has a strong record of implementing successful IT solutions across Punjab, will offer technical guidance and support. Both sides agreed to hold regular consultation meetings via Zoom to share insights and draft a practical roadmap for digital transformation. Randhawa instructed the CDA's IT Wing and senior officers to coordinate closely with PITB counterparts to set up monitoring dashboards for all CDA departments. These dashboards will feature real-time alerts and pop-up notifications to ensure tasks are completed on schedule. The meeting also discussed integrating modern banking systems into CDA's service payment platforms to improve efficiency and user experience. A feasibility report on all proposed systems, including their cost-effectiveness and alignment with modern digital standards, will be prepared and presented to the CDA Board. To ensure steady progress, Randhawa announced that weekly review meetings will be held under his chairmanship to monitor implementation timelines and troubleshoot emerging challenges. With Islamabad's rapid urban growth, CDA's digitization drive is expected to significantly streamline civic services, improve accountability, and reduce public reliance on in-person visits to government offices.",
