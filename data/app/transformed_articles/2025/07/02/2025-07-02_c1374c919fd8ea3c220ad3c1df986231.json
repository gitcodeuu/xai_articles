    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 02 (APP):The Prime Minister's Youth Program is set to distribute 100,000 laptops this month among talented and deserving students on merit, as part of the government's efforts to empower the youth of Pakistan. Chairman of the PM Youth Program, Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan, made the announcement during an exclusive interview with the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) on Wednesday. He also revealed that a comprehensive National Youth and Adolescent Policy-developed after extensive consultations with youth representatives and stakeholders-will be unveiled soon. \"The youth are our greatest national asset,\" Khan emphasized, adding that the government's top priority is to invest in their potential. The upcoming youth policy will focus on the \"Four Es\": education, employment, environment, and engagement, aiming to address key challenges and create new opportunities for Pakistan's youth. He shared that the PM Youth Digital Hub has gained significant momentum, with over 500,000 young individuals and 10,000 plus local and international companies registered on the platform. The hub serves as a one-stop portal for scholarships, job opportunities, and training programs. As part of overseas employment facilitation, the PM Youth Program is offering skills training to enhance foreign remittances. In addition, under the PM Youth Loan Scheme, aspiring emigrants can obtain loans up to Rs one million on easy terms. The Laptop for All Scheme is also being expanded, allowing youth to purchase laptops from banks on affordable payment plans. Highlighting the government's commitment to sports, Khan said over 10,000 young athletes from Balochistan participated in cricket trials under the PM Talent Hunt Sports Scheme in Quetta. Selected athletes will receive professional training at sports academies nationwide and may get the chance to represent Pakistan internationally. Furthermore, a 110-member National Youth Council, chosen on merit, will serve as an advisory body to the Prime Minister on youth-related matters. Additional initiatives include soft loans for startups, innovation awards for breakthrough ideas, and the upcoming Pitch Pakistan Program, scheduled to launch next week. This initiative will provide a national platform for young innovators to showcase their talents. Khan concluded that the PM Youth Program is committed to nurturing a generation of skilled, creative, and self-reliant youth by establishing modern incubation centers and providing funding for innovative ideas.",
