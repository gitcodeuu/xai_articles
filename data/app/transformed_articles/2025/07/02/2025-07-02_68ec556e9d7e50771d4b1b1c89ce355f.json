    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 02 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry chaired a high-level meeting on Wednesday to address the urgent repair and maintenance needs of the Kohsar Complex, a key government facility housing 16 federal ministries. Attended by representatives of the relevant ministries located in the complex, along with senior officials from the Capital Development Authority (CDA), the meeting focused on the deteriorating condition of the building and the immediate need for corrective action, said a press release. The Minister expressed serious concern over several pressing issues, including non-functional elevators, expired fire extinguishers, blocked fire exits, poor sanitation, and security lapses. He directed the CDA to take swift and concrete measures to restore all elevators, replace outdated fire extinguishers, and clear all fire exit routes in accordance with safety protocols. \"There is a clear and urgent need to improve the safety, cleanliness, and functionality of the Kohsar Complex,\" said the Minister. \"This facility must reflect the efficiency and dignity of the institutions it houses.\" To ensure accountability and expedite the process, a supervisory committee comprising representatives of the concerened ministries has been established. This committee will coordinate directly with the CDA and monitor all repair and maintenance activities, ensuring transparency and timely completion. The Minister also asked the allocation of designated parking slots to improve traffic management within the complex. He stressed the importance of upholding hygiene and maintaining a secure environment for government personnel and visitors. This initiative reflects the Ministry of Maritime Affairs' commitment to strengthening inter-ministerial collaboration and enhancing the operational standards. The CDA, in close coordination with the supervisory committee, is expected to begin implementation immediately.",
