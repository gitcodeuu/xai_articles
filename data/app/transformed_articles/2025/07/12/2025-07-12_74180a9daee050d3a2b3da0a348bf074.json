    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 12 (APP)::All types of medicines used by patients with mild or severe illnesses should be stored in cool, dry places, especially during the summer, as highlighted in a survey conducted on Friday. According to an APP reporter, she shared that she had visited a nearby pharmacy on Thursday to purchase medicines for common conditions such as diabetes and high cholesterol. The next day, she discovered that some of the medicines she received were unusually potent, prompting her to return them. When she went back, the pharmacist expressed frustration and explained that the medicines had been exposed to heat outside their packaging. She found this revelation surprising, as she realized she had forgotten the medicines in her car during her working hours instead of bringing them inside the office. It is important to raise public awareness about this sensitive issue. The pharmacist politely explained that medicines left in a hot car could lose their effectiveness or even become useless for treating health conditions. This was alarming and shocking for the reporter, as she recognized that her unintentional mistake could have posed a risk to human health. Therefore, it is essential for all citizens to purchase medicines from properly maintained, air-conditioned pharmacies and to store them at home in cool, dry places. This ensures that the medicines retain their effectiveness and protects users from the dangers of degraded or ineffective treatments due to improper storage in hot environments.",
