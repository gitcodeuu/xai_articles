    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 12 (APP): The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) on Saturday dismissed circulating claims about a revision in electricity peak hours as baseless and misleading, reaffirming that no changes have been made to the existing schedule. In a tweet on official X handler, the ministry clarified that reports suggesting the inclusion of morning hours in the peak time bracket are entirely false. \"Peak hours remain unchanged,\" the statement read, terming the circulating information as \"fake news and actionable disinformation.\" Authorities urged the public to rely only on official sources for accurate information and warned that the spread of such falsehoods could lead to confusion and would be dealt with under relevant legal provisions.",
