    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 12 (APP):Pakistan's Minister of State for Culture and National Heritage, Huzaifa Rehman, delivered a powerful address at the first-ever Global Civilizations Dialogue Ministerial Meeting held in Beijing yesterday, hosted by the Communist Party of China's Central Publicity Department. The conference was attended by over 600 delegates from 140 countries and regions, including ministers and representatives from Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Japan, France, Sri Lanka, and Bulgaria, as well as former presidents, prime ministers, and senior Chinese CPC leadership, said a press release received here on Saturday. State Minister Huzaifa Rehman eloquently presented Pakistan's civilizational heritage-from the Indus Valley and Gandhara to the Buddhist trail and Sufi culture-and invited the global community to invest in cultural exchange, heritage promotion, and sustainable tourism in Pakistan. \"Pakistan is a land of ancient civilizations. We invite the world to join us in preserving and celebrating our shared cultural legacy\" said Huzaifa Rehman. His speech earned a standing ovation, and Chinese media affectionately referred to him as the \"Young & Handsome State Minister of Pakistan.\" Pakistan's vibrant presence was in stark contrast to India's absence of a senior delegate, marking a key milestone in cultural diplomacy.",
