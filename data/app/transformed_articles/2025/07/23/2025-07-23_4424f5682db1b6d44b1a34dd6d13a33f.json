    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):TikTok removed over 24.95 million videos in Pakistan during the first quarter of 2025 for violating its Community Guidelines, according to the platform's newly released Q1 2025 Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. The report highlights that 99.4% of the flagged videos in Pakistan were removed proactively, with 95.8% taken down within 24 hours of being posted. These figures reflect TikTok's strong enforcement measures to maintain a safe and positive environment for users in the country. Globally, TikTok removed 211 million videos between January and March 2025, which accounted for about 0.9% of all uploaded content. Of these, over 184 million videos were detected and removed using automated systems, while around 7.5 million were restored after further human review. The report shows that 30.1% of the removed content featured sensitive or mature themes, while 11.5% violated safety and civility standards, and 15.6% breached privacy and security rules. A significant portion-45.5%-was classified as misinformation, and 13.8% consisted of edited or AI-generated media. TikTok emphasised that the report is part of its ongoing effort to increase transparency and accountability. The quarterly publication offers a detailed look at the scale and nature of content enforcement actions. Users interested in learning more about TikTok's content policies, safety tools, and the full Q1 2025 report can access the Transparency Centre, available in both Urdu and English.",
