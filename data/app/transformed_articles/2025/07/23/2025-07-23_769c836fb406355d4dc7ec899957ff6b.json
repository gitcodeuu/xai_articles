    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police on Wednesday launched Pakistan's first AI-integrated 'Police Station-on-Wheels' - a mobile unit empowered to register FIRs, respond to emergencies, and deliver on-the-spot police services across the capital, with a special focus on women and elderly citizens. The vehicle is directly linked to the Safe City surveillance network, which operates through 3,257 high-resolution cameras covering the entire city. According to a police statement, the smart policing vehicle was inaugurated by Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif at the Safe City Capital Command and Control Center. He was accompanied by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Minister of State Talal Chaudhry. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi briefed the Prime Minister on the operational capacity of the unit and its role in citizen-centric service delivery. IG Rizvi said the Police Station-on-Wheels is fully authorized to register FIRs from any sector of Islamabad and was developed to improve outreach to vulnerable groups, including women, the elderly, and working individuals. He said the initiative completed a successful two-month pilot phase, addressing over 7,000 complaints. On July 22, the first official FIR was filed by a female citizen - a landmark moment in public-oriented policing. IG Rizvi said, \"This mobile unit is not just a vehicle - it is a moving institution of law, justice, and community engagement. Whether it is a distressed woman, an elderly citizen, or a worker unable to leave their job - Islamabad Police will now reach their door on one call.\" IG Rizvi said the mobile vehicle is led by a female Sub-Inspector, supported by male and female motorcycle responders for rapid, gender-sensitive support. It is equipped with 12 policing software modules and directly connected to the AI-enabled Safe City network, which includes facial recognition, crime mapping, drone integration, and real-time surveillance. IG Rizvi said the system also supports taxi verification, e-challan processing, and behavior analysis - dramatically enhancing crime prevention and monitoring. During his visit, the Prime Minister reviewed the live surveillance feed and distributed laptops among officers managing virtual patrols and high-profile cases. He was also issued the first honorary driving license from the mobile unit, symbolizing the start of its full-scale operation. Officials said the 'Police Station-on-Wheels' is part of the broader Safe City reforms aimed at reshaping policing through AI-driven automation and direct citizen engagement - ensuring that law, service, and safety reach the public wherever they are.",
