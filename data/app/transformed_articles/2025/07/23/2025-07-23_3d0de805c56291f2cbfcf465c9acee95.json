    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):The Power Division on Wednesday clarified a news appeared in a section of press related to an audit report, stating that it pertains to the fiscal year 2023-24 and does not reflect the performance or actions of the present government. According to the spokesperson for the Power Division, the audit report under discussion is outdated and covers a period prior to the current administration's tenure. \"This is not a report of the current financial year, and it must not be viewed in the context of the reforms and corrective measures introduced by the present government,\" he added. The Power Division added that the report is preliminary in nature and is subject to review, further documentation, and evidence submission. \"The findings will be examined across relevant forums, and final figures are yet to be presented,\" it said, urging stakeholders not to draw conclusions from the initial observations. The spokesperson said that both the ministry and the government were already aware of the systemic challenges in the power sector, particularly the long-standing issue of overbilling and inaccurate meter readings. \"This has been repeatedly highlighted by Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari,\" the spokesperson added. In response to these concerns, the Power Division said the government has launched decisive and far-reaching reforms. Among these initiatives is the introduction of the \"Power Smart\" app under the \"Apna Meter, Apni Reading\" campaign. \"This technological intervention allows electricity consumers to record their own meter readings, helping to reduce billing discrepancies,\" the spokesperson added. More than one million consumers across the country have already downloaded the Power Smart application, which is being hailed as a major step toward transparency and consumer empowerment. According to the Power Division, losses in the power sector were recorded at Rs 591 billion in June 2024. As a result of policy reforms and efficiency measures, these losses have now been brought down by Rs 191 billion. The spokesperson said that the upcoming year has been designated as \"the year of reliable service for electricity consumers\" by Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari.",
