    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):A high-level delegation from the World Bank, headed by Ousmane Dione, Regional Vice President for MENAAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan), visited the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) One Window Facilitation Center here on Wednesday. The visit aimed to assess the comprehensive services and support provided to BISP beneficiaries under one roof. The delegation was warmly welcomed by the Chairperson of BISP, Senator Rubina Khalid; Secretary BISP, Amer Ali Ahmed; and Additional Secretary, Dr. Asmat Nawaz. The visiting team included key figures from the World Bank, such as Fadia M. Saadah, Regional Practice Director MENAAP; Almud Weitz, Regional Practice Director MENAAP; Lobna Hadji, Special Assistant to the Regional Vice President; Bolormaa Amgaabazar, Country Director for WB Pakistan; Gailius Draugelis, Manager of Operations; and other senior officials. In her welcome address, Chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid expressed her deep gratitude to the World Bank for its continued partnership and emphasized the significance of further strengthening this collaboration. She noted that BISP is the embodiment of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto's vision, a vision that came to life during her time in exile in Dubai. Senator Khalid highlighted BISP's transformative impact, particularly the empowerment of millions of marginalized women through the mandatory CNIC requirement, enabling their inclusion in Pakistan's national database. She also shared details of a new pilot project launching in major cities across Pakistan, aimed at facilitating the opening of bank accounts for BISP beneficiaries. Secretary BISP, Amer Ali Ahmed, provided the delegation with an overview of BISP's key initiatives and newly introduced programs, emphasizing the organization's push for financial inclusion through the adoption of digital banking services for beneficiaries. The visit included a tour of the One Window Center, where the delegation was briefed on various service counters, including Benazir Taleemi Wazaif, Nashonuma Awareness, Payment Mechanism, Saving Scheme, and Digital and Financial Literacy programs. The delegation also interacted with beneficiaries, witnessing firsthand the efficient, beneficiary-focused services being offered at the facility. The World Bank delegation commended BISP's critical role in delivering both conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs to Pakistan's most vulnerable populations. They particularly acknowledged BISP's adoption of digital payment systems and the program's strong focus on nutrition and female education. The visit underscored the successful collaboration between BISP and the World Bank in driving positive social change and financial inclusion for marginalized communities.",
