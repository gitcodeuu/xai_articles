    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):The World Health Organization (WHO), with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has distributed more than 800 motorbikes to Pakistan's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) across the country. The objective was to enhance the mobility of vaccinators and access hard-to-reach areas in 65 high-priority districts populated by 32.5 million people. The allocation plan directs 300 motorbikes to 21 districts in Sindh, 200 to 10 districts in Punjab and 108 to 24 districts in Balochistan. Eighty motorbikes have been provided to four districts in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), 80 in Islamabad and 60 to four districts in Gilgit Baltistan. Starting in March 2025, the vehicles have been progressively handed over to vaccinators nationwide to serve vulnerable populations in neighbourhoods with high numbers of children who have never been vaccinated (zero-dose) or are under-immunized. The support is guided by micro-plans, developed with technical support from WHO at the union council level, which aim to better monitor and address equity barriers to leave no child behind. \"These motorbikes aim to support the vaccinators who work tirelessly to reach the most vulnerable, wherever they are. Every 10 seconds vaccination saves a life, said WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo. He added since the foundation of the Pakistan Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1978 in partnership with WHO, vaccines have saved and protected millions of lives in Pakistan. He said WHO will continue to support Pakistan to protect every child with lifesaving vaccines, including those in hard-to-reach areas. He said as part of its seven decade partnership with Pakistan, WHO supports the Expanded Programme on Immunization to protect over seven million children and five million mothers each year with routine lifesaving vaccines.",
