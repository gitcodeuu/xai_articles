    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):The lower court of Islamabad on Wednesday postponed its decision in two cases filed under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act, linked to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protest on November 26. Judicial Magistrate Ahmed Shehzad Gondal was scheduled to announce the reserved verdict on today, but the decision could not be delivered due to incomplete documentation. The court had reserved its judgment on July 18 after final arguments were completed in both cases. These cases were registered at Ramna Police Station under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order (PAPO) Act. The two cases involve charges related to PTI's protest held in Islamabad on November 26. The verdicts in both cases were ready to be delivered but could not be finalized in writing, prompting the delay. Legal representatives of the accused and the prosecution had concluded their arguments in the previous hearing, after which the court had reserved its decision.",
