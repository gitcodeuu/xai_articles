    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):Environmental expert Zainab Naeem on Wednesday said that the recent wave of heavy rains and cloudbursts across Pakistan reflects the growing impact of climate change, compounded by urban planning challenges and environmental degradation. Talking to a private news channel, she said that although the government is increasingly recognizing these issues and taking steps in the right direction, there is still more room for collective efforts. She emphasized that while monsoon rains are part of the region's climate pattern, the current intensity and frequency of cloudbursts are not routine. She highlighted the government's efforts to initiate discussions on urban resilience and acknowledged Islamabad as one of the few cities with a formal master plan. She noted that even there, encroachments on green zones and dry riverbeds have caused damage. \"When you build on natural waterways, destruction becomes inevitable during heavy rains,\" she explained. She stressed the need for involving climate experts in city planning alongside engineers and architects. She said that the government has shown growing awareness about environmental issues, but more practical, on-the-ground implementation is required. While pointing out that Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global carbon emissions, she said the country still suffers some of the worst consequences of climate change. She called for the protection of forests around cities, reforestation in mountainous areas, and a stronger focus on local-level climate resilience.",
