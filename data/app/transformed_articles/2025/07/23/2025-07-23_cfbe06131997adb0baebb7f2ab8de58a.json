    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday underscored the pressing need to integrate climate resilience into Pakistan's development agenda, particularly in Gwadar, where the government is actively promoting Chinese-local partnerships to drive sustainable economic growth. During a meeting with a delegation from the Gwadar Press Club led by its President Ismail Umar, the minister reaffirmed the government's commitment for combating climate change while simultaneously improving livelihoods through resource-based development. He highlighted Gwadar's immense potential and emphasized leveraging local resources responsibly to build climate-resilient infrastructure. Junaid Chaudhry noted that initiatives such as setting up fisheries value-addition units and date processing plants would not only stimulate the local economy but also promote environmentally sound practices. \"Our approach is to build Gwadar's economy while ensuring it does not come at the cost of the environment,\" he said. The minister revealed that a 2,000-ton cold storage facility is already operational at Gwadar Port, playing a key role in minimizing post-harvest losses. He also addressed the urgency of climate adaptation, pointing to the operational trial of a 12,000-gallon capacity desalination plant, aimed at solving water scarcity, a major climate-related challenge in the region. In a green initiative, Junaid Chaudhry announced plans for a community-based tree plantation campaign in partnership with the Gwadar Development Authority, urging every household to plant at least one climate-suitable tree. \"A greener Gwadar is essential for a sustainable future. Community participation is key,\" he stated. Human resource development also featured in his remarks, as the minister emphasized aligning vocational training with international standards. This, he explained, would prepare Pakistan's youth for overseas employment, especially in climate-sensitive sectors where green skills are in high demand. Furthermore, in a step to enhance sustainable trade logistics, Chaudhry shared that the Karachi Cotton Association has agreed to route cotton imports through Gwadar Port. This move is expected to reduce transport emissions and improve supply chain efficiency by bringing Gwadar to the forefront of national trade logistics. Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry's multifaceted vision for Gwadar reflects a broader commitment to sustainable development - one that tackles climate change head-on while unlocking the region's socio-economic potential.",
