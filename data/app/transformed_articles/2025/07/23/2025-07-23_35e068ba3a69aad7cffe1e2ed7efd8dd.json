The meeting was attended by Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazir Tarar, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, Secretary Kashmir Affairs Zafar Hassan, Special Secretary Interior Dawood Baraich, Secretary Overseas and former Chief Secretary Shakeel Durrani and IG Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and senior officials of various ministries, said a press release on Wednesday. The committee is neither preparing any new draft of constitutional amendment, nor is the merger of the former FATA being abolished, nor is the revival of FCR under consideration. All the rumours spread in this regard are baseless. The sole objective of the committee is to formulate recommendations regarding the provision of prompt justice to the people of the merged districts, their development and prosperity, and ensuring their participation. Since the merged districts are part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, these recommendations will be sent to the provincial government so that the merged districts can be provided with facilities at par with other areas.",
