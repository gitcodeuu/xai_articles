    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police has launched Pakistan's first fully functional \"Online Women Police Station,\" ensuring round-the-clock protection for women, children and vulnerable segments of society, with immediate access to justice and safety through a single call on helpline 1815. A police spokesman told APP on Wednesday that the initiative has been launched following the vision and personal interest of Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif and under the special directions of Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi. The Online Women Police Station is equipped to handle domestic abuse, gender-based violence, and other crimes against women and children. A dedicated helpline (1815) has been established, where women can call without hesitation to report their complaints, seek legal advice, or receive immediate assistance, he said. Inspector General (IG) Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said that the station offers facilities such as video calling and online chat support, eliminating the need for women to visit a police station for registration of First Information Reports (FIRs), which are now delivered directly to their homes. IG Rizvi said that the station operates with a First Responder Unit that reaches the complainant's location within five to seven minutes. In cases where immediate resolution is not possible, female investigation officers from the Online Women Police Station take prompt action to ensure justice is delivered, he added. The IG said that all call handlers, responders, and investigating officers for the 1815 helpline were female police personnel. Moreover, emergency calls made to the general 15 helpline are automatically redirected to 1815 using artificial intelligence, ensuring no distress call goes unheard, he told. Rizvi said the helpline operates 24/7 to guarantee that assistance is always just one phone call away for those in crisis. The initiative is also fully integrated with the AI-supported \"Police Station-on-Wheels,\" which can be dispatched alongside first responders whenever needed, he added. He said that the core objective of the Online Virtual Women Police Station was to provide rapid, dignified and technology-enabled solutions to gender-based crimes and ensure no victim was left unheard.",
