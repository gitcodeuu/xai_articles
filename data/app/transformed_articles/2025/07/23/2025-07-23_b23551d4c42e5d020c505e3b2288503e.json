    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP): Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Dr. Musadik Malik, has called for urgent, coordinated global action on climate change during high-level bilateral meetings with COP-29 leadership in Azerbaijan. Speaking on the sidelines of the COP Heads of Delegation Retreat in Shamakhi, Dr. Malik emphasized that developing countries like Pakistan faced disproportionate climate impacts despite contributing little to global emissions. In meetings with Mukhtar Babayev, President of COP-29 and Special Envoy on Environment to the President of Azerbaijan, and Yalchin Rafiyev, Azerbaijan's Deputy Foreign Minister and COP-29 Lead Negotiator, Dr. Malik underlined the urgent need for equitable climate policies and the fulfillment of climate finance commitments by developed nations. \"The Global South continues to bear the brunt of climate-induced disasters, while the Global North remains responsible for the majority of historic and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions,\" Dr. Malik said, adding that Pakistan's geographical proximity to two of the world's largest polluters makes its situation uniquely vulnerable. Dr. Malik also described climate change as a \"transboundary issue,\" stressing that environmental degradation and extreme weather events affect populations across borders and demand collective international responses. The discussions highlighted shared concerns about the accelerating pace of global warming and explored avenues for green cooperation between Pakistan and Azerbaijan. Proposed areas of collaboration include renewable energy development, climate-resilient agriculture, and disaster risk reduction strategies. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to multilateralism in climate governance and expressed hope that COP-29, scheduled later this year, would deliver tangible progress toward inclusive and science-based climate solutions. Dr. Malik expressed confidence in Azerbaijan's leadership of the upcoming COP and reiterated Pakistan's support for efforts to advance climate justice and resilience. \"We need meaningful action-not just pledges. This is a critical moment to restore trust and deliver on climate finance and emissions reductions,\" he said.",
