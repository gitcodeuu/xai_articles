    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):WaterAid Pakistan marked the successful conclusion of its three-year Urban Water initiative with a high-level learning and closing event in Karachi. The initiative, launched in 2022 with the support of the PepsiCo Foundation, focused on improving access to clean drinking water and promoting sustainable hygiene practices in underserved urban settlements, schools and healthcare facilities across Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta, said a press release here on Wednesday. The project directly benefited tens of thousands of people through the installation of water filtration systems, hygiene promotion and the establishment of local water user committees to ensure the sustainability of services. Syed Sardar Ali Shah, Sindh's Minister for Education, called access to water and sanitation a basic right and urged greater accountability. He said, \"WASH is fundamental to human dignity, education, and health. Every child deserves clean water and safe sanitation. I acknowledge the role of organisations working on WASH, and call on all of us, as government, civil society, and citizens, to hold ourselves accountable. We must work together to meet this basic need and build systems that are climate-resilient and inclusive.\" Mian Muhammad Junaid, Country Director of WaterAid Pakistan, said the project had shown that effective collaboration between communities, governments and the private sector could deliver lasting improvements in urban WASH systems. \"This project has delivered infrastructure, it has invested in people - in their capacity to lead, manage and sustain essential services. It is also a powerful example of how private sector engagement with the development sector, communities and government can create shared value and long-term impact,\" he said. Hatim Khan, Senior Director of International Programs at the PepsiCo Foundation, said the partnership reflected the Foundation's global commitment to expanding access to safe water in water-stressed regions. A panel discussion on \"Learning Together for Sustainable WASH\", moderated by broadcaster Tauseeq Haider, featured Haseeb Malik, Supply Chain Senior Director at PepsiCo Pakistan; Muhammad Ammad, Executive Director of IDEA; Nisar Ahmed Nizamani, CEO of DevCon; Dr. Amjad Rashid, CEO of Taraqee Foundation; and Saadia Iqbal, Program Lead at Mojaz Foundation. The discussion focused on lessons around sustainability, inclusive design and pathways for scale-up. The event concluded with a reaffirmation of the collective commitment to accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation for All.",
