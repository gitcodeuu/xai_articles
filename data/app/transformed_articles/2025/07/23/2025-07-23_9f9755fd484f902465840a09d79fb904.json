    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):The National Skills University (NSU) Islamabad, already on the international map as a UNESCO-UNEVOC Centre and European Training Foundation Centre of Vocational Excellence, has once again demonstrated its global academic reach. Two of its female faculty members have completed the prestigious STEM Faculty Development Programme at King's College London. This milestone underscores NSU's rapidly rising profile in global skills-based education. This achievement stems from the broader Pak-UK Education Gateway Project, a collaborative initiative supported by the British Council and Pakistan's National Academy of Higher Education (NAHE/HEC). The rigorous faculty development programme took place across leading UK institutions, including the National STEM Learning Centre at the University of York, the University of Birmingham, and King's College London, said a press release issued here on Wednesday. Dr. Maryam Subhani, Department of General Studies and Ms. Anita Bibi, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, represented NSU for this training. Their selection and success in this highly competitive programme reflect the institution's dedication to continuous learning, innovation, and pedagogical excellence, as well as their personal growth and dedication to their profession. Participants engaged in immerse sessions on Cutting-edge teaching frameworks such as the Conceiving, Designing, Implementing, and Operating (CDIO) system and the responsible integration of generative AI in education; authentic assessment strategies paired with real-time student feedback; curriculum reform aligned with outcome-based education; and gender equity and sustainability in STEM teaching and research. In addition, the programme facilitated strategic academic exchange and research collaboration between Pakistani and UK institutions, advancing the global impact of Pakistani academia. Speaking on the occasion, Founding Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar lauded the achievement, stating: \"This success is not only a personal milestone for Dr. Subhani and Ms. Bibi, but a testament to NSU's evolving academic ethos. As an internationally recognized institution, we aim to embed global best practices into our educational DNA and strengthen Pakistan's future workforce through world-class faculty.\" Prof. Dr. Mukhtar's leadership has been pivotal in transforming NSU from a national institution into a globally recognized hub of vocational and technical excellence. Through his vision, the university has earned international affiliations and continues to set benchmarks in STEM education, skills development, and inclusive academic innovation. This latest development reinforces NSU's strategic commitment to nurturing globally competent faculty, enriching student experiences, and elevating Pakistan's presence in international higher education forums.",
