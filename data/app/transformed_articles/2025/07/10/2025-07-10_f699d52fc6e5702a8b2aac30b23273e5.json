    "article_body": "Qingdao, China, Jul 10 (APP): As India continues to face diplomatic isolation on major global forums, Pakistan reaffirmed its active and mature presence on the world stage through a dynamic participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) ministerial meeting held in Qingdao. Representing Pakistan, Minister of State and Special Assistant to Prime Minister for Culture and National Heritage, Huzaifa Rehman, delivered a compelling, thoughtful address while also engaging in high-level bilateral meetings with key regional and international delegates, reinforcing Pakistan's commitment to peace, partnership, and regional integration, said a press release received here on Thursday. In his address, State Minister Rehman stated, \"Pakistan is fully committed to enhancing its cooperation with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization at every level. China is not just a neighbor but a brother, and we are determined to work with all member states to make the SCO a robust, forward-looking, and effective platform.\" He emphasized regional connectivity, protection of shared cultural heritage, and collaborative tourism development, receiving high praise from fellow participants. His remarks reflected both Pakistan's ancient civilizational depth and a modern diplomatic approach grounded in mutual respect and peace-building. Rehman's presence in China is a testament to Pakistan's evolving foreign policy, which places cultural and tourism diplomacy at its core. It signals a shift from hard power posturing to a more holistic and people-centered global engagement strategy. In his concluding remarks, he noted, \"Pakistan and China are more than just neighbors - we are brothers at heart. Pakistan deeply values China's unwavering support at global forums, and we envision a region where culture and tourism drive sustainable peace and unity.\" Pakistan's active, thoughtful, and culturally aware diplomacy continues to break new ground, offering the world a narrative based on cooperation, heritage, and shared human values.",
