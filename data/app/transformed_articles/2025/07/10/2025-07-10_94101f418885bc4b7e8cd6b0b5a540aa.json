    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP): Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Human Rights and Member of National Assembly Saba Sadiq on Thursday expressed heartfelt grief and sorrow over Sania Bibi's death, offered condolences to the family, and directed the Islamabad Police to take strict action against those accused. According to police, Sania Bibi, aged 28, died at PIMS Hospital in Islamabad after she suffered burns in an alleged incident of torture and arson by her in-laws. Police said Sania Bibi's father-in-law, Mastasib, and her husband, Adil Mehmood, allegedly tortured her and set her on fire by pouring petrol on her. The PIMS hospital administration said that 70 to 80 percent of her body sustained burns and a medical examination revealed injuries on her head and other parts of her body. Kirpa Police have registered a case against Mastasib and Adil Mehmood on June 9th and started an investigation. Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Human Rights MNA Saba Sadiq urged the authorities to ensure justice for Sania Bibi's family and to prevent happening of similar incidents in future.",
