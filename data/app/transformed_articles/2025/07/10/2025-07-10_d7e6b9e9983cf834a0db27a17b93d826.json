    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday directed the relevant authorities to formulate a comprehensive plan to transform the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) into a shipping company of international standard. The prime minister, chairing a meeting to review the restructuring, reforms, and performance of the PNSC, said that Pakistan's shipping sector held vast potential for investment. He directed that a comprehensive plan be prepared to encourage private investment in the shipping sector. He called for steps to increase the number of ships and promote the competitive use of PNSC vessels for cargo movement to and from Pakistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz advised to acquire the services of shipping experts and consultants to elevate PNSC to an international standard shipping company. He expressed the hope that the reforms in the PNSC would not only save valuable foreign exchange currently being paid to international companies for shipping services but also create more employment opportunities for local seafarers. The participants of the meeting were briefed on the PNSC's operations, the current number of vessels in the PNSC, the annual cargo movement in Pakistan, and the future expansion plans for the organisation. Federal ministers Ahad Khan Cheema, and Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, and relevant senior officials attended the meeting.
