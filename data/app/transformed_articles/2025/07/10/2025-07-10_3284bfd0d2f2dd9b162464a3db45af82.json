    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):The Senate Standing Committee on Science and Technology in a meeting held on Thursday emphasized the importance of strengthening Pakistan's scientific institutions and addressing public health concerns linked to certain consumer products. The meeting, chaired by Senator Kamil Ali Agha at the Parliament House, brought together committee members, officials from the Ministry of Science and Technology, and representatives from the Pakistan Council for Science and Technology (PCST) and Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR). One of the key points of discussion was the National Commission for Science and Technology (NCST), established in 1984, which has met only three times since its formation, with the last meeting held in 2001. The Committee noted the need to activate the Commission and ensure that its statutory responsibilities are met effectively. It was highlighted that while the PCST acts as the Secretariat to NCST, challenges such as delayed appointments and resource constraints have limited progress. Chairman Senator Kamil Ali Agha underlined the importance of revitalizing the NCST, proposing the formation of a committee within 15 days to streamline its operations. He urged that existing institutions and infrastructure be utilized to their full potential. The committee members also reviewed budget allocations for the science and technology sector. The Ministry reported that only 0.16% of GDP is currently allocated to this field, with Rs 4.5 billion released in the current fiscal year. Members observed that increased investment is crucial for modernization and innovation. Senator Dr. Afnan Ullah Khan drew attention to global advancements, such as China's upcoming solar power project in space, and suggested that Pakistan adopt a forward-looking approach to science, particularly in renewable energy and public awareness. The Committee also deliberated on the Pakistan National Quality Policy (PNQP) 2021, with a focus on ensuring the safety of food and dairy substitutes. Concerns were raised over the health risks posed by some \"tea-whitening\" products marketed as milk alternatives. Officials acknowledged these concerns and agreed on the need for stricter enforcement of quality standards, along with awareness campaigns and regulatory action where necessary. In closing, Chairman Agha reiterated the significance of institutional capacity-building and inter-agency coordination for national progress in science and technology.",
