    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):Speaker National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has expressed deep concern over the rapid population growth in Pakistan, terming it a serious challenge that exerts immense pressure on national resources and leads to severe issues in education, healthcare, employment, and the provision of basic services. In his message on the occasion of World Population Day, observed globally on July 11 under the auspices of the United Nations, the Speaker emphasized that sustainable development, poverty eradication, and social stability cannot be achieved without maintaining a balanced population growth. Citing data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations, the Speaker noted that Pakistan ranks among the countries with the fastest-growing populations - a situation that demands urgent attention. He reiterated the Parliament's resolve to address social challenges, particularly through legislation aimed at achieving population balance. The Speaker urged greater public awareness about the implications of unchecked population growth and called on provincial governments, political parties, public representatives, religious scholars, civil society, and the media to play their vital role in this regard. Deputy Speaker National Assembly, Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, stated in his message that a balanced population is key not only to economic progress but also to ensuring equal access to education, healthcare, and dignified employment for all citizens. He stressed the need for policy-making institutions to devise long-term plans keeping in view future needs, in order to effectively overcome the challenge of population growth.",
