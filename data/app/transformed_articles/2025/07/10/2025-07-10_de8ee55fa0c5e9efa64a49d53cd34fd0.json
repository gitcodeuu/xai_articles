The minister reiterated Pakistan's principled stance on Palestine, declaring, \"Israel is an illegitimate state, Pakistan has never recognized it and never will.\" He said Pakistan has consistently condemned Israeli atrocities against the oppressed people of Palestine. Expressing deep sorrow over the ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza, particularly the bombing of civilians including women and children, the minister said, \"Our hearts bleed for the innocent lives lost.\" He emphasized that Pakistan will continue to raise its voice to awaken the conscience of the international community. Calling for a united response, Sardar Yousaf said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) must prioritize the issue of Palestine on its agenda, adding that the liberation of Masjid Al-Aqsa remains a matter of collective concern for the Muslim Ummah. \"Like every Pakistani, I too long to offer prayers at Masjid Al-Aqsa. Just as we visit Makkah and Madinah freely, we yearn for unimpeded access to the first Qibla,\" he said. Ambassador Zaid, in response, expressed deep appreciation for Pakistan's steadfast and selfless support for the Palestinian cause. \"The people of Palestine hold Pakistan's unwavering solidarity in the highest regard,\" he said. He added that many graduates from Pakistani universities are now serving in key positions across Palestine, further strengthening the bilateral relationship. The ambassador emphasized that Masjid Al-Aqsa remains under illegal Israeli occupation, but the Palestinian people remain determined to sacrifice their lives, wealth, and families for its freedom. Ambassador Zaid also announced that Dr. Mahmoud Al-Habbash, Adviser to the Palestinian President, along with the Imam of Masjid Al-Aqsa, will soon undertake an official visit to Pakistan. The meeting concluded with both sides reaffirming the importance of strong religious, cultural, and political ties, and pledging continued cooperation in support of the Palestinian struggle.",
