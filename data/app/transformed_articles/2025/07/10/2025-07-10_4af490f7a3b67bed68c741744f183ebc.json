    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):As India faces growing diplomatic estrangement on key international platforms, Pakistan strengthened its global standing through an impressive cultural and diplomatic presence at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) ministerial meeting, held in Qingdao, China. Minister of State and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Culture and National Heritage, Huzaifa Rehman, led Pakistan's delegation with a strong and thoughtful address that highlighted the country's commitment to regional peace, cultural preservation, and tourism-led economic development. He also held meaningful bilateral meetings with several regional and international counterparts on the sidelines of the summit, said a news release. \"Pakistan is fully committed to enhancing its cooperation with the SCO at every level. China is not just a neighbor but a brother,\" said Rehman during his speech. \"We aim to work with all member states to make the SCO a robust, forward-looking, and effective platform.\" Rehman's remarks were met with appreciation from fellow ministers, particularly for their emphasis on regional connectivity, protection of shared cultural heritage, and collaborative tourism promotion. His approach underscored a vision of diplomacy rooted in civilizational harmony, people-to-people ties, and shared values. The minister's active participation at the Qingdao forum reflected Pakistan's evolving foreign policy, which places cultural diplomacy and soft power engagement at the heart of its international outreach. His visit also reaffirmed Islamabad's deepening strategic and cultural ties with Beijing. \"Pakistan and China are more than just neighbors-we are brothers at heart,\" Rehman noted in his concluding remarks. \"We envision a region where culture and tourism drive sustainable peace and unity.\" As geopolitical tensions reshape the global order, Pakistan's constructive and inclusive diplomacy stands in sharp contrast-offering the region and the world a cooperative, heritage-rich, and forward-looking vision.",
