    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):The National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a warning over heightened risks of flash floods and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF), particularly across Gilgit-Baltistan and northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. As analyzed by the NEOC, a sharp rise in temperatures across northern Pakistan-especially in Gilgit-Baltistan and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-has accelerated the melting of glaciers and snow, leading to heightened river flow levels. The regions requiring close monitoring include the Ghujerab and Shimshal Rivers in Hunza, Braldu River in Shigar, Husher and Saltaro Rivers in Ghancha, and Uzhnu Gol in Chitral. People living near key rivers, streams, and nullahs are advised to remain alert to abrupt increases in water levels-particularly during nighttime and periods of heavy rain. Stay informed by monitoring official flood updates via television, radio broadcasts, and mobile notifications. Ensure that communities situated near rivers and nullahs are familiar with designated evacuation paths for timely and safe relocation. Residents in vulnerable regions are strongly advised to safeguard valuables, vehicles, and livestock by relocating them to higher ground. It's essential to have emergency supplies-such as food, drinking water, medical items, and basic necessities-ready for at least 3 to 5 days. Travel near glacial lakes, rivers, or narrow valleys should be avoided. Remain vigilant for signs like unusual noises or increasing water levels, and move to safer areas immediately if necessary. Always adhere to official warnings and instructions from relevant authorities.",
