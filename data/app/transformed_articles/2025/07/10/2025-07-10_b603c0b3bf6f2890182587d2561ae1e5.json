    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):Pakistan and Russia have reaffirmed their shared commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation in the energy sector during a high-level meeting between Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Syed Tariq Fatemi and First Deputy Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, Pavel Sorokin. The meeting took place in Moscow as part of SAPM Fatemi's official two-day visit to Russia aimed at bolstering strategic engagement, particularly in the field of energy, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs news release said. During the talks, Ambassador Fatemi expressed satisfaction over the ongoing energy collaboration between the two countries and thanked the Russian government for its continued support in helping to ensure Pakistan's energy security. He emphasized that energy remains a key priority area in Pakistan-Russia relations, with growing involvement from both governments and private sectors. \"The active engagement in energy cooperation reflects the strong foundation of our bilateral relationship. We are confident that this partnership will expand further in the months ahead,\" said Ambassador Fatemi. Deputy Minister Sorokin, who had previously visited Pakistan in February and met with Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, acknowledged the positive trajectory of energy cooperation and highlighted new avenues for collaboration. These include hydropower development, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) projects, and the modernization of oil refineries in Pakistan. He further noted that energy will feature prominently on the agenda of the upcoming 10th session of the Pakistan-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation, scheduled to take place in Islamabad later this year.",
