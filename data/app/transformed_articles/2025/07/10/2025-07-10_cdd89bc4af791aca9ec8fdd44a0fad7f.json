    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP): The Capital Development Authority (CDA) Board, in its 13th meeting on Thursday approved the restructuring of the CDA Security Directorate to improve internal operations and service delivery. The changes are aimed at increasing operational efficiency, strengthening monitoring mechanisms, and enforcing merit-based internal accountability. The meeting held at the CDA Headquarters, greenlight a series of reforms and development initiatives aimed at improving governance, enhancing urban services, and promoting sustainable development across Islamabad. It was chaired by CDA Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa, and attended by senior members of the authority, including Talat Mehmood (Administration & Estate), Tahir Naeem (Finance), Esfandyar Baloch (Environment), Dr. Khalid Hafiz (Planning), and Syed Nafasat Raza (Engineering). Professor Dr. Muhammad Ali, Vice Chancellor of Punjab University, joined via Zoom. One of the key decisions taken by the board was the conditional restoration of Plot No. 6 in Blue Area, Sector G-8/F-8, in line with a ruling by the Islamabad High Court. The restoration will remain provisional until a final verdict is given by the Supreme Court on CDA's appeal. Additionally, the Enforcement Directorate will be reorganized to boost its capacity to remove illegal encroachments and unauthorized constructions across Islamabad. This move is part of CDA's broader effort to maintain the capital's planned urban character and uphold building regulations. In another important development, the board approved amendments to the promotion criteria for non-gazetted CDA employees, potentially benefiting hundreds of staff by streamlining career advancement processes. The board also constituted a special committee to assess employment extension requests for project-based staff at CDA Hospital. The committee will evaluate legal parameters before making any recommendations. On the public transport front, the CDA Board was briefed on steps to improve the city's metro and air-conditioned electric bus operations. Plans include implementing third-party evaluations, e-ticketing systems, and introducing an AI-based integrated passenger management system to enhance service efficiency and commuter experience. Speaking at the meeting, Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa reiterated the CDA's commitment to transforming Islamabad into a model capital. \"The development and prosperity of Islamabad are our top priorities,\" said Randhawa. \"We are executing projects across various sectors and taking all necessary steps to meet the housing needs of citizens. We are also working to improve the city's environment by planting eco-friendly trees and upgrading parks and public spaces.\" He added that CDA is funding many of its development projects through its own revenue-generating streams, reflecting a focus on sustainable financing.",
