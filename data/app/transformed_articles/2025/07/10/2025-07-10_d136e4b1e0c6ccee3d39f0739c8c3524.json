    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi on Thursday said that Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is actively advocating the cause of Kashmir on the global stage, following in the visionary footsteps of his grandfather, Shaheed Zulfikqar Ali Bhutto. He added that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) remains the true voice of Kashmiris across the world. The Governor made these remarks while addressing a luncheon hosted in honor of former Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Sardar Tanveer Ilyas and his companions on their joining of PPP. The event was held at the Islamabad Club, where Governor Kundi was the chief guest. Prominent leaders of PPP AJK including Chaudhry Riaz, former AJK President Chaudhry Yaqoob, Speaker of the AJK Legislative Assembly Chaudhry Latif Akbar, several ministers, advisors, and members of the assembly attended the gathering. In his speech, Governor Kundi said that the inclusion of Sardar Tanveer Ilyas and his team into PPP will further strengthen the party. \"PPP has always upheld the slogan that Kashmir's development, freedom, and right to self-determination are essential. The party has consistently raised its voice for Kashmir's cause,\" he emphasized. He reaffirmed the historical and emotional bond between the people of Kashmir and Pakistan, describing it as \"inseparable.\" Kundi added that whenever PPP has been in power, it has taken practical steps to uphold the rights and development of the Kashmiri people. The Governor expressed confidence that the day is not far when loyal PPP members will serve as Prime Ministers both in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir.",
