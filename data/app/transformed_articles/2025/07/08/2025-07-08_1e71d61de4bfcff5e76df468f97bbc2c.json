During the meeting, the CEO briefed the Minister on the company's contributions to the pharmaceutical industry. Minister Mustafa Kamal emphasized the need for collaborative efforts across sectors to improve the country's health system. \"The rapid growth in Pakistan's population is a serious challenge that undermines all planning efforts,\" said Minister Kamal. \"If current trends continue, Pakistan will become the fourth most populous country in the world by 2030.\" He highlighted the country's current fertility rate of 3.6%, stressing the need to reduce it in order to manage resources effectively. Minister Kamal also pointed out critical issues in public health infrastructure. \"Pakistan lacks an effective sewage treatment system, which directly contributes to the spread of disease. Nearly 68% of illnesses in the country are caused by the consumption of contaminated water,\" he noted. He affirmed that providing clean drinking water is a top priority, and work is underway to implement sewage treatment systems nationwide. To strengthen Pakistan's primary healthcare system, the government is expanding telemedicine services. \"We are now bringing doctors and medicines directly to people's doorsteps,\" the Minister shared. He added that the growing burden on major hospitals highlights the urgent need to reinforce healthcare delivery at the grassroots level. \"A comprehensive roadmap has been developed to improve and strengthen the health system. Prevention is better than cure, and our goal is to protect people from falling ill in the first place,\" said Minister Kamal. He reiterated that large-scale reforms are underway to transform Pakistan's health sector. Collaborative efforts needed to improve Pakistan's health system, says Health Minister.",
