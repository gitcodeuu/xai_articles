Burhan Wani iwas an icon and shining star of Kashmir's history who will always be remembered as a symbol of resistance and resilience against Indian suppression. Kashmiri people consider him as a benefactor, savior and hero, as he represented his oppressed nation with great courage and sacrificed his life for the sacred cause of freedom from Indian slavery. Every year on the anniversary of this great martyr, the Kashmiri nation renews its pledge to fulfill the great mission for which Burhan Wani and more than 600,000 Kashmiris sacrificed their precious lives since 1947 till date. He was martyred by Indian brutal forces during a fake encounter in Kokernag area of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir on June 8, 2016. The day was observed as Resistance Day across Azad Kashmir. Protest rallies, public gatherings and seminars are being held in all districts under auspices of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Commission, Pasban-e-Hurriyat, other Hurriyat organizations and political parties to pay homage to the popular youth leader, Shaheed Burhan Muzaffar Wani, and his associates.
