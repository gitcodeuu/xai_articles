While acknowledging the efforts of the staff, Mustafa Kamal directed that 20 additional beds be added to the dermatology and psychiatry departments located at G-7/3-4 to cater to the growing patient load. He also ordered the development of a comprehensive feasibility plan for upgrading the old building of Polyclinic Hospital, incorporating a modern HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system. The minister emphasized that this should be aligned with a holistic service delivery improvement plan to ensure better healthcare outcomes for the public. In a decisive move to enhance diagnostic capacity, Kamal instructed the immediate installation of an MRI machine. He reiterated his commitment to ensuring the provision of quality healthcare services to the public at all costs, stating, \"Access to timely and quality medical care is a fundamental right of every citizen.\" Later, the Federal Health Minister visited the under-construction New Emergency Block at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences where he assessed the pace of construction work. He was briefed by the Executive Director of PIMS and officials from Infrastructure Development Authority Punjab (IDAP). The briefing highlighted that the new emergency facility would have a capacity of 200 beds. Minister Kamal directed the PIMS administration and IDAP to immediately prepare a comprehensive project presentation, including a clear timeline and details of all challenges. \"I must be briefed on all obstacles faced by the project, along with deadlines for completion,\" he said. He assured that any challenges falling under the Ministry's jurisdiction would be resolved on an urgent basis, and tasks assigned to other stakeholders must be executed on a fast-track basis. He stressed that the new emergency project is directly linked to saving human lives, and that swift completion and operationalization is a national priority. He also directed that the hospital's sewage treatment system be upgraded to meet quality standards, and emphasized that the provision of clean drinking water remains a top priority of the Ministry.
