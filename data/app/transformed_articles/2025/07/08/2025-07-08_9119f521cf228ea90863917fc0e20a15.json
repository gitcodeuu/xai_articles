    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):The lower court of Islamabad on Tuesday directed the blocking of 27 YouTube channels, including those operated by well-known journalists and political figures, following a request from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). The order was issued in connection with an inquiry into content alleged to be against the state. Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah issued the written order in response to the FIA's plea to block YouTube channels spreading content deemed harmful to the state's interest. The court directed the YouTube officer in-charge to take action to block the listed channels. The order named prominent figures such as journalists Matiullah Jan, Siddique Jan, Sabir Shakir, Asad Toor, Orya Maqbool Jan, and Imran Riaz Khan.
