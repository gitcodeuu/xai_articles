    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 8 (APP):The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training (MoFEPT) on Tuesday launched the National Training of Trainers (ToT) Programme at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), marking a key milestone in strengthening Pakistan's non-formal education (NFE) system. According to a press release, in Pakistan, children, youth, and adults who are unable to access formal education due to poverty, remoteness, or age are supported through community-based non-formal education centers. These centers offer them a second chance to acquire essential reading, writing, and numeracy skills. The programme, led by the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE) with technical assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), brings together master trainers from across the country who will cascade their learning to grassroots educators within their respective provinces and regions. Addressing the launch event, Federal Secretary for Education Nadeem Mahbub emphasized that non-formal education must be recognized as a permanent and integral component of the national education system. \"Non-formal education is not just a stop-gap-it's a credible and essential learning pathway for millions of Pakistanis,\" Nadeem said. \"That's why we're prioritising reforms in teacher capacity, assessments, digital tools, and monitoring to ensure this sector thrives.\" Director General of PIE Dr Muhammad Shahid Soroya said the ToT programme is a strategic investment in human capital. \"Each trainer here is a catalyst for change in their community,\" Shahid noted. \"The knowledge and skills they gain will multiply in impact as they return to their regions and train others.\" Participants like Shazia Bano from Gilgit-Baltistan and Asadullah Khan from Balochistan shared how the training has inspired them. \"This training gives me the confidence and tools to help those who never had the chance to attend school,\" said Bano. \"We're giving people a new beginning,\" added Abdullah. In his closing remarks, Secretary Nadeem Mahbub reiterated the ministry's resolve to scale up non-formal education across the country through sustained investment, strong partnerships, and innovative approaches. Representatives from the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD), National Education Foundation (NEF), Basic Education Community Schools (BECS), Federal Directorate of Education (FDE), National Institute for Educational Testing and Evaluation (NIETE), JICA, and the Secretary Delivery Unit were also present at the event. The event was part of the ministry's broader efforts to promote inclusive and equitable quality education across Pakistan",
