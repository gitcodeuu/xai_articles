    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):The Lower Court of Islamabad on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers who failed to appear in court despite repeated summons in cases related to the Azadi March. Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti passed the order during a hearing of the cases registered against PTI leaders and supporters in connection with the Azadi March. During the proceedings, defense lawyers Sardar Muhammad Masroof Khan Advocate, Amna Ali, Zahid Bashir Dar, and others appeared before the court. Attendance of the present accused was recorded, while those who remained absent without exemption faced the issuance of arrest warrants. The court postponed further hearings of the cases until July 19. The cases are registered at Bara Kahu Police Station and involve multiple PTI members, including the party's founding chairman and former leader Zartaj Gul. Several individuals, including Zartaj Gul, have already been acquitted in at least one of the cases.",
