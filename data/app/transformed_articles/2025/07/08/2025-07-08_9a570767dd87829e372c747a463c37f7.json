    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD/ PESHAWAR, Jul 8 (APP)::Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) stands as the most vulnerable province in Pakistan to the ongoing monsoon crisis, revealing critical infrastructural weaknesses and governance gaps that intensify the disaster's impact. Despite repeated devastation from floods, KPK continues to lack adequate water management systems, enforcement of construction laws, and sustainable disaster preparedness, leaving its communities exposed and fragile. As Pakistan faces another season of unpredictable monsoon rains, the death toll has steadily risen over the past 10 days. While fatalities have been reported across all four provinces, KPK has been hit the hardest, with over 29 lives lost, many injured, and extensive destruction to infrastructure, especially in its economic centers. KPK's deficient infrastructure for managing excess water results in fatal floods and water-related accidents. The Pakistan Meteorological Department has issued widespread warnings, forecasting rainfall through July. Some of the worst-affected areas, Swat, Kalam, and Chitral are among KPK's premier tourist spots. These regions rely heavily on tourism for economic survival, as breathtaking mountains and rivers draw visitors who support local livelihoods. Tragically, these natural features that attract tourism also fuel recurring floods, destroying roads, bridges, hotels, and entire villages. These disasters don't just disrupt tourism; they devastate livelihoods and local economies, while the rugged terrain hinders rescue and reconstruction efforts. Despite frequent destruction, effective preventative measures remain lacking. Other parts of KPK suffer from damaged roads and agricultural losses. In Mohmand district, heavy rains wiped out livestock and crops overnight. Flooded roads have isolated communities, like in Kandia Tehsil, cutting off transport and trade, while power outages worsen the crisis. KPK has endured similar disasters before. In 2022, severe floods claimed over 300 lives and displaced thousands, triggering food shortages and waterborne diseases. The government's assessment reported nearly Rs 245 billion in damages in KPK alone, including Rs 25 billion in tourism infrastructure losses in Swat. Each flood deepens poverty and destabilizes fragile communities, threatening the province's economic foundation. Despite recurring crises, systemic vulnerabilities persist, why do these tragedies keep recurring, and what can be done? Climate change intensifies these extreme weather events. Rising global temperatures disrupt weather patterns, leading to unpredictable and heavier monsoon rains, glacier melt, and flash floods. Inadequate infrastructure and poor water management compound the damage. Although Pakistan contributes only 0.88% of global emissions, it ranks fifth globally in climate vulnerability. Dr. Iffat Tabussum, a retired professor of Geogrpahy from the University of Peshawar talking to APP said, \"Pakistan's diverse geography makes it highly susceptible: coastal areas face cyclones, high altitudes suffer glacier melt, and plains endure heatwaves. Our dependence on agriculture and lack of water-retention infrastructure like dams amplify these impacts.\" Many still dismiss climate change, but its devastating effects demand urgent attention. Continued rainfall threatens infrastructure lacking proper drainage, agricultural lands, tourism, property, and lives. Citizens are urged to avoid waterways and unnecessary travel as rains persist. Fatima Faraz, a climate activist and a consultant at Sustainable Energy and Economic Development talking to this scribe highlighted governance failures and said, \"Laws prohibit construction near rivers but are routinely ignored. Government actions lack proper research or benefit, like planting water-draining Eucalyptus trees in arid areas, worsening water scarcity.\" This negligence underscores a critical policy gap in addressing climate change. The government must enforce regulations on riverside construction, fund disaster management, and build flood-resilient infrastructure, including dams for water storage. Housing and employment support are essential to prevent flood survivors from falling into poverty. Without swift, decisive action, KPK's economic backbone will continue to collapse under flood pressures, as climate change fuels more frequent disasters causing displacement and loss of life. Government, communities, and individuals must collaborate to adopt sustainable, well-researched policies. Urgent reforms are vital to prevent worsening poverty, food insecurity, and irreversible damage to lives and ecosystems. The future of KPK depends on the choices made today to withstand a changing climate.",
