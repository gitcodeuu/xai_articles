    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 8 (APP): A recent survey by Piyass International Human Rights has found overwhelming public and expert support for the Capital Development Authority's (CDA) performance regarding development projects in federal capital Islamabad. The survey praised CDA's leadership under Chairman CDA, Chief Commissioner Islamabad, and Director General Civil Defence Muhammad Ali Randhawa for delivering development, said a press release issued here on Tuesday. The survey collected responses from over 10,000 participants, including business leaders, economists, educationists, real estate professionals, construction industry representatives, and the general public. The findings reflected strong confidence in the current leadership and appreciated the efforts of the CDA in completing several major development projects in the city and suburban areas using its limited resources. Among the projects highlighted were the construction and repair of roads, new underpasses, signal-free corridors, sector development, installation of streetlights, conversion to energy-efficient lighting, beautification of link roads and other beautification projects. According to engineers and urban planning specialists, CDA's development model has become a benchmark for effective, transparent, and sustainable urban planning. They described the authority's strategy as not only practical but also a potential template for similar initiatives across the country. On this occasion, Chairman Piyass International Human Rights Rana Imran Latif said that the authority has delivered visible results within a limited budget. He also lauded CDA for ensuring transparency, self-reliance, and planning in development works which reflects a responsible use of public funds and sets a new standard for governance. He further added that the recent developmental changes in Islamabad will not only improve the quality of life for residents but also serve as a national example of how public institutions can achieve progress through integrity, planning, and financial discipline.",
