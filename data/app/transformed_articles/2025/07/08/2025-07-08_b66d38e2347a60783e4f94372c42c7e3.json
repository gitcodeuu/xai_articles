    "article_body": "RAWALPINDI, Jul 08 (APP): Federal Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting and senior Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader Barrister Danyal Chaudhry said that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has delivered two major development projects to the people of Rawalpindi including the Nawaz Sharif Flyover and the GPO Chowk Underpass. These projects will not only ease commuting within the city but also facilitate travel for those coming to Rawalpindi from other cities. In an exclusive conversation with APP, Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry said that under Maryam Nawaz Sharif's leadership, the Punjab government is diligently working on welfare projects and infrastructure improvements across the province. These development initiatives provide lasting solutions to commuting issues while also creating new employment opportunities through enhanced infrastructure and road construction, paving the way for public prosperity. He emphasized that the Pakistan Muslim League (N) has always prioritized public service, development, and the provision of modern urban facilities. For a major and significant city like Rawalpindi, projects like the Nawaz Sharif Flyover and GPO Chowk Underpass are historic steps that will permanently address long-standing urban traffic problems. Barrister Danyal Chaudhry noted that these projects will save citizens valuable time and reduce air pollution. He reiterated the commitment that the PML-N government will continue its journey of development, prosperity, and public service with the same zeal, and more mega projects will be launched in the coming days to transform Punjab into a true model province.",
