    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Tuesday directed the Ministry of Law to compile a comparative chart on values of silver, gold, etc., and to outline the prevailing practices in other Muslim countries regarding blood money (diyyah). The Senate body met here under the Chairmanship of Senator Farooq Hamid Naek to deliberate on pivotal legislative proposals aimed at aligning Pakistan's legal framework with contemporary realities while ensuring adherence to Constitutional and Shariah principles. The meeting took place at Parliament House Islamabad. The Committee discussed The Pakistan Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025 (Amendment of Sections 323, 330, and 331) related to the payment and estimation of blood money (diyyah). Speaking on the occasion, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, the bill's mover, emphasized that the issue of blood money (diyyah) has long been a matter of concern for both jurists and the judiciary due to its great importance in people's daily lives. She highlighted that the bill seeks to modernize the valuation mechanism of diyyah, taking into account contemporary economic conditions and the spirit of Shariah. The statement of objects and reasons clarified that since traditional assets like camels, gold, and silver have fluctuated significantly in value and accessibility, a modern framework is essential to ensure fairness for both victims' families and offenders. It is also necessary to create deterrence so that no one simply pays blood money (diyyah) and gets away, while the victim's family continues to suffer. Reiterating the Islamic principle of Agilah, Senator Zehri underscored that among the good attributes advocated by Islam are cooperation and collaboration on righteousness. It is thus necessary for governments and charitable organizations to allocate funds for those unable to pay, to prevent undue hardship and prolonged imprisonment. The committee recognized that the minimum amount of diyyah must be consistent with Shariah stipulations, as reaffirmed by the representative of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), who stated that the minimum amount of diyyah remains fix grams of gold, and any amendment must strictly adhere to the injunctions of the Quran and Shariah. Given the sensitive nature of the matter, the Committee resolved to defer further deliberations to allow for comprehensive input from all relevant stakeholders. The Ministry of Interior will be invited to share their viewpoints, particularly on the practical implementation of the proposed amendments. Furthermore, the Committee sought the final opinion of the Council of Islamic Ideology, so that no legislation on diyyah must fall outside the bounds of Quranic principles. The Ministry of Law was directed to compile a comparative chart on values of silver, gold, etc., and to outline the prevailing practices in other Muslim countries. Chairman Senator Farooq Hamid Naek concluded the session by acknowledging the spirit behind the proposed changes: The intention behind these amendments is to ensure greater deterrence against crime, align our laws with the economic realities of our time, and safeguard the rights of victims' families in line with Islamic teachings. The body deferred The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2024 (Substitution of Article 140A and amendment of Article 160) on local governance due to the absence of the mover, Senator Khalida Ateeb. The meeting was attended by Shahadat Awan, Kamran Murtaza, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Zamir Hussain Ghumro, the Minister of state for Law and Justice, and Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri as mover of the bill.",
