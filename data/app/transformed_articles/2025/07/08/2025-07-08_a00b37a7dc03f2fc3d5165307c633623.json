    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has issued a clarification following objections raised in the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) regarding the ownership and rental status of its headquarters building. According to a NADRA spokesperson, the property in question was originally allotted in 2000 by the Government of Pakistan to NADRAas predecessor, the National Database Organization (NDO), through an official letter. After the reconstitution of NDO, NADRA was formally established in 2002, and the allotment was reaffirmed by the government on March 9 of the same year. aThe NADRA headquarters has been operating from the same location for the past 25 years, and no objections have been raised in any audit report issued by the Auditor General,a the spokesperson said. The spokesperson further clarified that other government offices operating within the same building have also not been asked to pay rent. The issue was thoroughly reviewed during NADRA Authority Boardas 69th meeting, where it was concluded that since the federal government allotted the property to NADRA, no rent is due. aAs a responsible institution, NADRA continues to regularly pay its applicable property tax to the Capital Development Authority (CDA),a the spokesperson added.",
