    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):A meeting of the Sub-Committee for the Pakistan Civil Awards 2025 was held on Tuesday at the Cabinet Division, Islamabad. The session was chaired by the Federal Minister for Human Rights, Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar and attended by Secretary Ministry of Human Rights, Mr Abdul Khaliq Shaikh, along with senior officials of the ministry. The committee examined nominations submitted by various nominating agencies, involving individuals recognized for their outstanding contributions to public service, philanthropy and social welfare. Officials from the Cabinet Secretariat and other concerned departments were present, with representation from all provinces and regions, ensuring a diverse and inclusive review process. Participants emphasized the importance of a transparent, merit-driven approach that truly reflects the spirit of national recognition. The committee reaffirmed that nominations must strictly follow the approved policy guidelines and Terms of Reference, focusing on distinguished achievements that demonstrate national-level impact. Routine career progression was not considered sufficient grounds for recommendation. In cases where an individual has already received a Civil Award, only clearly exceptional services rendered thereafter should warrant reconsideration. It was further emphasized that gender balance, provincial representation, and inclusion of minorities and persons with disabilities must be duly reflected in the nomination process, aligning with the principles of equity and national unity.",
