    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):The lower court of Islamabad on Tuesday moved forward with the case involving Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers charged in connection with the May 9 protest and sought arguments on acquittal pleas submitted by 29 accused party members. Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti heard the case related to the May 9 protest, registered at Karachi Company police station. During the hearing, attendance was marked for the present accused, while exemption requests from 11 others were accepted by the court. The hearing also saw 29 PTI workers file formal requests seeking acquittal. The court responded by issuing notices and called for arguments on these applications. Defense counsel Sardar Masroof Khan Advocate requested a longer adjournment, stating that many of the accused had traveled from remote areas of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He told the court that attending every hearing was financially burdensome for these workers, who could not afford frequent travel and time away from work. After hearing the submissions, the court adjourned the proceedings until October 25. The case stems from a First Information Report (FIR) filed at Karachi Company Police Station following PTI's May 9 protest.",
