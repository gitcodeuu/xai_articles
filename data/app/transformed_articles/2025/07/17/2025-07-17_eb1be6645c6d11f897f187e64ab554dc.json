    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Senator Irfan Siddiqui, Parliamentary leader of Pakistan Muslim League (N) in the Senate, met with former Federal Information Minister Muhammad Ali Durrani for a comprehensive exchange on the country's current political climate. Speaking on the occasion, Muhammad Ali Durrani emphasized the need for political stability in Pakistan. He remarked that politics is the art of unlocking closed doors and progressing despite differences. He stressed that, in light of the internal and external challenges facing Pakistan, meaningful dialogue, constructive cooperation, and improved coordination among political parties and leaders are imperative. He called on serious-minded and historically aware politicians to step forward and play a proactive role in addressing these issues. Muhammad Ali Durrani emphasized that avenues for dialogue should be opened in the national interest, and urged the government to demonstrate generosity in this regard. Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who also chairs the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, affirmed that under the leadership of Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) has consistently kept the doors to dialogue open. He pointed out that rejecting dialogue goes against the democratic ethos of the party and its leadership, as reflected in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's multiple invitations for negotiations. However, he expressed concern over the disappointing stance of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which continues to favor confrontational and violent protests over constructive engagement. Senator Siddiqui commended Muhammad Ali Durrani's constructive approach, noting that while democratic forces have endured a difficult past, they have learned valuable lessons and discovered new avenues for growth. He underscored that genuine progress is only possible through a forward-looking and democratic mindset.",
