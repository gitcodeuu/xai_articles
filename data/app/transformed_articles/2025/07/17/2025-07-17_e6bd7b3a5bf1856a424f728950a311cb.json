    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, on Thursday directed all field teams to remain on high alert as heavy monsoon rains continue to lash the federal capital. Randhawa emphasized the need for maximum field presence by joint teams of CDA, Emergency and Disaster Management, Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), and the district administration. \"All teams must remain in the field and provide every possible assistance to citizens,\" he stated in a news statement. Personally supervising field operations, the CDA Chairman said that his top priority is ensuring uninterrupted traffic flow on all major roads in Islamabad. \"Necessary measures must be taken so that citizens do not face any inconvenience during the rains,\" Randhawa stressed. He instructed the sanitation and environment departments to keep personnel and machinery stationed near stormwater drains (nullahs) for continuous monitoring. \"Ensure that all water channels are clear and any obstruction to the flow is immediately removed,\" he directed. Highlighting the importance of underpasses and other vulnerable locations, Randhawa called for uninterrupted drainage in these areas. \"It must be ensured that there is no water accumulation anywhere in the city,\" he said. The CDA Chairman also ordered intensified monitoring in low-lying areas and directed the CDA administration to maintain strict vigilance. \"There should be no negligence. All officers must remain present in the field to ensure an effective monitoring system,\" he said. He encouraged citizens to report emergencies or complaints through CDA's helpline 16 or the district administration's number 1334. \"All complaints must be resolved immediately-without any delay,\" Randhawa added.",
