    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Capital Development Authority (CDA), in a landmark move to promote inclusivity and interfaith harmony, has approved the development of a dedicated Christian graveyard in Sector H-8/1 at an estimated cost of Rs. 275 million. The decision was taken during the 76th meeting of the CDA Development Working Party (CDA-DWP), chaired by CDA Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa on Thursday. Senior officials from the Planning Commission, Ministry of Interior, Finance Division, CDA Board Members, and project consultants were in attendance. The graveyard project, which aligns with the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR)'s efforts to uphold equal rights and dignity for all communities, aims to ensure a long-awaited facility for Islamabad's Christian residents. It also reflects the government's broader commitment to reducing social discrimination, improving public health infrastructure, and strengthening interfaith relations. \"Infrastructure development and human rights go hand in hand,\" said Chairman Randhawa. \"This project is not only about land allocation-it's about dignity, equality, and social justice.\" In addition to the graveyard initiative, the CDA-DWP also approved two major road infrastructure projects aimed at resolving chronic traffic bottlenecks in the capital. A PC-I for addressing traffic congestion at Shaheen Chowk - the intersection of 9th Avenue and Khayaban-e-Iqbal - was approved at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.899 billion. Designed by M/s NESPAK, the project includes the construction of a 2+2 lane underpass for through traffic on Khayaban-e-Iqbal, along with a redesigned at-grade roundabout for turning traffic. Once completed, the project is expected to improve the Present Serviceability Index (PSI) from E to A. The construction is expected to be completed within six months. Similarly, another key project approved during the meeting was the construction of a two-lane flyover at Rawat T-Chowk - the junction of G.T. Road and Islamabad Highway. Also designed by M/s NESPAK, the Rs. 1.803 billion project aims to streamline traffic flow from N-5 (Gujar Khan side) onto Islamabad Highway. Upon completion in 12 months, the project is expected to eliminate signal-based delays on this critical stretch and facilitate uninterrupted travel on Islamabad Highway. The CDA noted that both road projects are part of broader efforts to modernize urban mobility, reduce commute times, and enhance road safety in the capital region.",
