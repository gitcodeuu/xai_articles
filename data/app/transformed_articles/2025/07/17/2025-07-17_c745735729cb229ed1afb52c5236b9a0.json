    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):The District and Sessions Court of Islamabad on Thursday approved the interim bail of former Station House Officer (SHO) Shaukat Mehmood in the case of a suspect's death in Tarnol police lockup. The court also issued a notice for a written response from the prosecution. The case was heard by District and Sessions Judge Nasir Javed Rana. During the proceedings on Shaukat Mehmood's pre-arrest bail application, the court granted interim bail until July 19 against surety bonds worth Rs 50,000. The judge also asked the prosecution to submit a reply and summoned arguments at the next hearing. Shaukat Mehmood, along with other police officials, is nominated in the case of citizen Nauman's alleged custodial death, which occurred inside the Tarnol police station. At the time of the incident, Shaukat Mehmood was serving as the SHO of the concerned police station. Following the incident, he was suspended from his position. Initially, the Tarnol police had registered the case against the accused officials. After the post-mortem report confirmed that Nauman had been subjected to torture, the case was transferred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for further investigation. The FIA then registered a new case against the suspects, including charges of murder and torture under relevant sections of the law. Four police officials are already in FIA custody on a four-day physical remand as part of the ongoing investigation. The court is set to review the case further in the next hearing, where arguments on Shaukat Mehmood's bail request will be presented.",
