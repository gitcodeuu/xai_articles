    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):The Federal Flood Commission (FFC) has said that currently River Indus is flowing in medium flood at Guddu and in low flood at Tarbela and Sukkkur. According to daily FFC report on Thursday, River Jhelum at Mangla is likely to remain between low to medium flood while at Rasul it may rise to high flood during the next 24 hour. Urban flood is also anticipated in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad Division during the said period due to scattered thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy falls during the said period. The combined live storage of Tarbela, Chashma and Mangla reservoirs stands at 8.328 million acre feet. Heavy rainfall over the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi caused a sharp rise in water levels in Lai Nullah. The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) Lahore has forecasted widespread thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy falls and torrential rains at few places over Islamabad and Punjab (Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Sargodha Divisions) during the next 24 hour. Scattered thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy falls may also occur over Punjab (Lahore and Sahiwal Divisions) including the upper catchments of all the major rivers during the said period.",
