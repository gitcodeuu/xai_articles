The high turnout and aggressive bidding highlighted investor confidence in Islamabad's growing commercial potential. Chairman CDA and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa personally supervised the auction process, ensuring transparency and strong oversight. Speaking about the success of the event, Randhawa said, \"The overwhelming response from investors demonstrates their trust in CDA's transparent auction process and Islamabad's promising investment climate.\" The final day of the auction saw keen investor interest in retail spaces at the Blue Area Parking Plaza, where shop No. 8A fetched Rs145.7 million, 10A went for Rs143.2 million, 12A sold at Rs146.7 million, and 8C closed at Rs94.3 million.

To attract and inform investors, CDA also hosted an Investment Expo at the Jinnah Convention Centre. Information booths from the Environment Wing, MCI, and the Sports and Culture Directorate were set up to provide guidance.

In a move to incentivize swift investment, CDA is offering a 5% discount on full payments made within one month, with an additional 5% discount for lump-sum payments in US dollars. \"The revenue generated from this auction will be utilized for Islamabad's development,\" said Randhawa. \"This includes infrastructure upgrades, road improvements, and urban beautification to transform Islamabad into a modern, model capital.\"",
