    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, July 17 (APP):Turkish Ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Irfan Neziroglu on Thursday reaffirmed the deep-rooted and evolving friendship between Turkiye and Pakistan, describing the bond as 'beyond fraternal ties.' Addressing the certificate distribution ceremony at the conclusion of the Turkish Summer Camp for Children at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), organized by Yunus Emre Institute, Islamabad, the ambassador expressed pride in the growing collaboration between the two nations across political, economic, and defense sectors. \"Our relationship continues to strengthen with every evolving situation - it has now reached a new level,\" he added. Congratulating the children who successfully completed the summer camp, Dr. Neziroglu said, \"You are not only the future of Pakistan, but also of Turkiye.\" He emphasized the importance of cultural and linguistic exchange, encouraging children to continue learning the Turkish language and consider pursuing higher education in Turkiye. \"Turkiye is among the top countries offering scholarships to Pakistani students,\" he noted, adding that many Pakistani students are currently studying in Turkish universities and more opportunities await future learners. In a warm and symbolic interaction with the children, the ambassador asked them to raise their right hand and say \"This is Pakistan,\" then raise their left hand and say \"This is Turkiye.\" He then urged them to join both hands tightly and declared, \"We will live together like this forever.\" The ambassador also floated the idea of hosting the next summer camp in Turkiye, inviting the children to participate there. He thanked the parents for enrolling their children and invited feedback to improve future camps. He also praised Allama Iqbal Open University for being a hub of cultural exchange and acknowledged Rector Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood for his hospitality and vision. During the event, certificates were awarded to all participating children. Ambassador Dr. Neziroglu was presented with a shield as a token of appreciation, while Yunus Emre Institute's Country Director, Dr. Khalil Toker, received a commendation certificate for organizing the summer camp.",
