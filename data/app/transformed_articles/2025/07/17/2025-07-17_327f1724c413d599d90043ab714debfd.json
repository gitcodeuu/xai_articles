    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Chairman of the Senate, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, on Thursday underscored the need for strong institutions and transparent systems to ensure sustainable development and improved public service delivery in Pakistan. Addressing the closing ceremony of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers FIDIC Asia-Pacific Mid-Year Conference 2025, Gilani said, \"During my tenure as Prime Minister, we actively promoted public-private partnerships, encouraged infrastructure investment, and built a regulatory environment that fostered innovation and business growth.\" He reaffirmed his commitment to advancing reforms that strengthen Pakistan's engineering and infrastructure sectors, while promoting institutional integrity, technical excellence, and inclusive development. The Senate, he said, is ready to support legislation aimed at improving procurement governance, encouraging ethical engineering practices, and adopting dispute resolution mechanisms aligned with global standards. Gilani emphasised the importance of collaboration among the government, private sector, and international development partners to accelerate national progress. He praised the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and other partners for their continued support in building technical capacity, financing infrastructure, and pushing forward critical reforms in Pakistan. Acknowledging the conference's inclusion of young professionals, Gilani said, \"Empowering our youth is both a moral duty and a strategic necessity. Their creativity, energy, and adaptability will shape the infrastructure of the future.\" He commended the Association of Consulting Engineers Pakistan (ACEP) for organizing a dynamic forum that brought together experts and stakeholders from across the Asia-Pacific and beyond. \"The thoughtful design of this conference, the quality of discussions, and diverse participation reflect Pakistan's rising stature in the global engineering and infrastructure landscape,\" he noted. Highlighting the vital role of infrastructure in national development, Gilani said roads, bridges, power grids, and water systems are not just physical structures but essential lifelines that connect people, boost trade, and uplift communities. He also praised FIDIC's efforts in setting international standards of integrity and efficiency in project delivery. Stressing the need for responsible use of public funds, he advocated for the adoption of globally recognised practices in Pakistan's infrastructure development. Calling for a future where infrastructure is both well-constructed and well-governed, the Senate Chairman expressed hope that the ideas exchanged and connections made during the three-day conference would foster ongoing collaboration. President of ACEP, Wasim Asghar, also addressed the gathering and thanked Chairman Gilani for his remarks. He said the conference provided an important platform for dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and regional cooperation. Delegates from various countries participated in the event, contributing to its success as a meaningful forum for professional exchange.",
