    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):The Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Thursday suspended the closure order of another YouTube channel while hearing appeals against a lower court's decision to block 27 channels. During the latest hearing, the court granted interim relief to Sajid Nadeem's YouTube channel, halting its closure for the time being. A notice was also issued to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), directing it to submit a response by July 21. Earlier, the same court had suspended the blocking orders against eight other channels. These suspensions came after appeals were filed against the initial decision. The original order to block 27 YouTube channels was issued by Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah. The appeals challenging this order are still under review, and further hearings are scheduled to determine the legality and implications of the closures.",
