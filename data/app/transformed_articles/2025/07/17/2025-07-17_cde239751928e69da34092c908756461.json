According to a press note released here Thursday, the event brought together a wide cross-section of the legal fraternity, including Mr. Rauf Atta Advocate, President SCBAP; Mr. Attaullah Langove, President Balochistan High Court Bar Association; and Qari Rahmatullah President Quetta District Bar Association, representatives from various lawyers' organizations, as well as members of the Supreme Court, High Court, and District Bar Associations. Addressing the gathering, Chief Justice Afridi underscored the vital partnership between the Bench and the Bar, describing it as the cornerstone of an effective and responsive justice delivery system. He expressed heartfelt joy at reconnecting with the city and its legal community, warmly appreciating keeping up the tradition of hospitality, referring to Quetta as \"a home away from home.\" During his interaction, the Chief Justice engaged directly with lawyers, listening to their concerns and discussing issues affecting their practice. In a significant announcement, he shared that two batches of female lawyers, each comprising 30 lawyers, one from Quetta and the other from Makran, will be provided specialized training at the Federal Judicial Academy, Islamabad. He emphasized the need for dedication and diligence within the legal profession, calling on all stakeholders to work collectively to ensure the timely and effective delivery of justice to the public. In addition, the Chief Justice assured the legal fraternity of his commitment to improving facilities for lawyers at the Supreme Court Branch Registry Quetta. This includes the provision of space for a bar room and the establishment of a facilitation centre to better serve the needs of the legal community as well as litigants. On the same day, Chief Justice Afridi also convened a meeting with a committee representing the Bar Councils at the Branch Registry. The meeting was attended by Mr. Ahmed Faroq Khattak, Vice Chairman Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council; Mr. Rahib Khan Buledi, Vice Chairman Balochistan Bar Council; and Mr. Qasim Ali Gojizai, Chairman Legal Education Committee. The committee highlighted the financial challenges faced by Bar Councils in implementing mandatory training for newly enrolled advocates, as required under a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan.
