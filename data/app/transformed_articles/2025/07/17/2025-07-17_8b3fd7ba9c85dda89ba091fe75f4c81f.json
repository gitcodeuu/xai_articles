    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Intermittent rainfall continued across Islamabad on Thursday, prompting the district administration to intensify drainage efforts in several low-lying areas to prevent urban flooding. According to the spokesman of ICT administration here, various parts of the federal capital witnessed light to heavy showers throughout the day, leading to water accumulation in some areas. The Islamabad administration has mobilized sanitation teams across the city to ensure quick drainage of rainwater, particularly in areas prone to flooding. He said that the assistant commissioners are actively supervising the drainage operations on the ground. The teams, equipped with heavy machinery, have been deployed to clear water from low-lying localities where waterlogging was reported after the rainfall. \"Sanitation teams are working continuously to ensure smooth drainage of rainwater, and assistant commissioners are overseeing these operations directly,\" the spokesman stated. The district administration has also put in place a monitoring system for the city's stormwater drains. Officials are regularly inspecting the condition of these drains to prevent any blockages that could exacerbate flooding risks in vulnerable areas. The spokesman further advised residents to stay vigilant and immediately report any emergency situations related to water accumulation or flooding to the administration. \"We are monitoring the situation round the clock, and citizens are requested to inform us promptly in case of any emergency,\" the official added. Weather-related alerts have been issued, and the district administration is coordinating with relevant agencies to ensure swift action in case of further rainfall. The city's control rooms remain active to respond to any complaints or requests for assistance from residents. In recent days, the capital has been experiencing a monsoon spell, increasing the pressure on the drainage infrastructure. City officials have urged residents to cooperate with the administration by avoiding dumping waste into stormwater drains, which can cause blockages and disrupt the drainage process. The ICT administration reiterated its commitment to mitigating the impact of rain on the city's infrastructure and ensuring that normal life is not disrupted. However, officials acknowledged that continuous monitoring and public cooperation are key to effectively handling the situation. Citizens can contact the district control room or the offices of their respective assistant commissioners to report any drainage or flooding issues in their areas. The administration has assured timely response to all complaints received through these channels.",
