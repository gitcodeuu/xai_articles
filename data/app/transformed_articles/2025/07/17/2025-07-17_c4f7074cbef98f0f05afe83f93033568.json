    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP): The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of urban flooding and rising water levels in seasonal streams and rivers across multiple regions of Pakistan due to expected heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours. The public has been advised to stay informed through official channels, including the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert App. NDMA spokesman said the National Disaster Management Authority, along with relevant agencies, is taking proactive measures to manage any potential emergency. The NDMA has urged the public to exercise extreme caution amid heavy rain forecasts and potential flooding. Citizens are advised to avoid crossing nullahs, bridges, and submerged roads, and residents in low-lying areas should relocate valuables and livestock to safer ground. People in vulnerable zones are encouraged to prepare emergency kits with food, water, and medicines for three to five days. Local administrations have been directed to keep drainage machinery ready, while residents are advised to stay updated through official alerts on TV and mobile platforms. According to the alert, Rawalpindi and Islamabad are expected to experience intermittent torrential rainfall over the next 24 to 48 hours. The NDMA has cautioned that the intense downpour may lead to a surge in Nullah Leh, posing a serious risk of flooding in low-lying areas. NDMA has advised twin cities residents, especially those residing near Nullah Leh, to remain vigilant, take precautionary measures, and evacuate vulnerable locations if sirens are sounded. Citizens have also been urged to cooperate fully with relevant departments during any emergency response. Severe rain, accompanied by windstorms and thunderstorms, is highly likely within the next 12 hours across several districts of Punjab, including Lahore, Chakwal, Attock, Jhelum, Khushab, Sargodha, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Hafizabad. The NDMA has instructed all relevant departments to implement advance preparedness measures to effectively manage any potential emergency.",
