The meeting, attended by senior officers from relevant ministries, focused on implementing decisions taken in the previous meeting and addressing issues faced by Chinese investors. Ahsan Iqbal said resolving problems faced by Chinese investors was a top priority for the government. \"The government is committed to ensuring a safe and conducive environment for Chinese investment, which is crucial for bilateral cooperation in new sectors under CPEC Phase II,\" he added. The minister said CPEC has the potential to play a significant role in increasing regional cooperation, with the Gwadar Port poised to become a hub of regional trade. He highlighted the importance of protecting the interests and employment of local fishermen in Gwadar, adding that the pace of water and power projects in the area be accelerated. The meeting directed that pending issues in projects built with Chinese investment be resolved immediately.
