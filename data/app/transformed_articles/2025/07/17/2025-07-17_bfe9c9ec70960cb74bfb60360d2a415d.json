The task force will be headed by Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi and will include members from the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), Punjab Irrigation Department, and other relevant institutions. Chairing a review meeting on the clean water supply system in Islamabad and surrounding areas here, the prime minister directed CDA to present a comprehensive plan with regard to recharging underground water reservoirs using rainwater. A system should also be developed to prevent contamination of Rawal Dam due to sewage from adjacent settlements and drains that flow into the dam, the prime minister said directing to swiftly establish a wastewater treatment system to treat sewage discharged from illegal and informal settlements. He also instructed to establish a water supply system soon to deliver the approved quota of water from Tarbela, Khanpur, and other dams to households in Islamabad. The committee should finalize the formation of a Water Board for Islamabad and adjoining areas without delay, the prime minister stressed.
