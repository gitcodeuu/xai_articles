    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Speakers at an international workshop on healthcare leadership stressed the urgent need to re-imagine leadership as a transformative force to reform health systems and cultures across the Muslim world. The high-level workshop titled \"Healthcare Leadership: Global Models for Transforming Systems and Culture\" was jointly organized by OIC-COMSTECH, IiLM, and HealthRAB at the COMSTECH Secretariat in Islamabad. It brought together healthcare professionals, policy experts, and leaders from OIC member states to explore values-based and locally adaptive models of leadership. Dr. Zakiuddin Ahmed, a renowned leadership coach and founder of IiLM, remarked that leadership in healthcare must go beyond administrative functions. \"This is not merely about management - it's about understanding the deeper purpose of leadership and aligning global frameworks with our own realities,\" he emphasized. Prof. Dr. Muhammad Iqbal Choudhary, Coordinator General of COMSTECH, in his keynote address, highlighted the organization's expanding role in health sciences. \"We are addressing infectious diseases, advancing bioinformatics, supporting vaccine development, and exploring AI in medicine - but none of this is possible without visionary leadership,\" he said. He called health a shared moral responsibility and a unifying force for OIC nations. The hybrid-format event was attended by representatives from countries including Afghanistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, China, Cameroon, Azerbaijan, Sudan, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. Participants came from national health institutions, universities, diagnostic labs, hospitals, and allied health organizations. The workshop also showcased COMSTECH's contributions in neglected tropical diseases, traditional medicine, digital health, and health biotechnology, with a strong focus on building leadership capacity across these areas. Organizers expressed hope that the initiative would help cultivate a sustained community of healthcare leadership practice across OIC member states, paving the way for meaningful collaboration and systemic reform. The event was widely praised for redefining leadership as not just a skill, but a catalyst for transforming healthcare globally.",
