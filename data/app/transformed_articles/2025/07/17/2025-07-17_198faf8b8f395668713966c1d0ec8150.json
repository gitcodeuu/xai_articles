    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):The National Assembly Standing Committee on Defence Thursday expressed its wholehearted appreciation for the resumption of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights to the United Kingdom (UK) and France after five years. The Committee which met with Fateh Ullah Khan in the Chair reviewed the progress of PIA's flight operations and discussed strategies for enhancing the country's aviation sector. The Committee commended the efforts of the Ministry of Defence and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) in facilitating this significant milestone, which underscores the government's commitment to reviving Pakistan's international connectivity. The Director General Pakistan International Airlines Company Limited (PIACL) provided a comprehensive briefing on the airline's current status, including its organizational structure, fleet development, and domestic and international network expansion, etc. While acknowledging the positive steps taken and the gradual reclamation of PIA's lost stature through targeted management initiatives, the Committee noted with concern the ongoing challenges faced by the citizens due to the absence of domestic flight operations. The Committee reaffirmed its support for the government's efforts to privatize PIA, with a firm stance on protecting the airline's heritage and national identity. It emphasized that, in the event of privatization, the airline's aircraft should continue to display the Pakistani flag and the iconic PIA logo, symbolizing national pride and continuity. Furthermore, the Committee urged that the airline's employees be treated with compassion and fairness throughout the privatization process, safeguarding their rights and livelihoods. The Committee also received assurances from the Secretary of Defence that all recommendations will be implemented in letter and spirit. The meeting was attended by the MNAs Ibrar Ahmad, Saba Sadiq, Isphanyar M. Bandara, Ramesh Lal, Sadiq Iftikhar, Sanjay Parwani, Gul Asghar Khan, Pulain Baloch, Muhammad Aslam Ghumman, and Ghulam Muhammad. Senior officials from the Ministry of Defence, Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA), Pakistan International Airlines (PIACL), and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) also participated in the discussions.",
