    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Pakistan and Turkiye share a long-standing historical, friendly, and fraternal relationship, and we hope that the new generations of both countries will further strengthen this bond. Ambassador of Turkiye to Pakistan, H.E. Irfan Neziroglu, said this while addressing the certificate distribution ceremony of the two-week Turkish Summer Camp for Children, organized by Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) in collaboration with the Yunus Emre Institute, Pakistan, said a press release on Thursday. Ambassador Neziroglu noted that political, diplomatic, and economic ties between Pakistan and Turkiye are steadily strengthening. He emphasized that initiatives such as the summer camp serve as a vital platform for fostering closer connections between the younger generations of both nations, thereby contributing to deeper bilateral engagement. He also commended AIOU and the Yunus Emre Institute for the successful organization of the event. Vice Chancellor, AIOU, Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood, underlined the importance of promoting cooperation with friendly countries in today's global context. He stated that language learning plays a pivotal role in bringing nations closer and strengthening international relations. Highlighting the significance of skill-based education, he urged parents and educators to reduce children's screen time and instead focus on nurturing their talents and knowledge through constructive activities. Dr. Mahmood also mentioned that AIOU has prioritised foreign language education in recent years. As part of these efforts, the university has introduced language programmes in Japanese, Russian, and Turkish over the past three years. He praised the Turkish language instructors at the camp for their dedication, particularly in helping children develop accurate pronunciation. Dr. Zahid Majeed, Director, Directorate of International Collaboration and Exchange, stated that during the 10-day camp, 35 children were trained in the Turkish language, calligraphy, and archery. They were also introduced to Mangala, a traditional Turkish game. He noted that earlier this year, a similar summer camp was organised at AIOU's regional campus in Karachi with the support of the Yunus Emre Institute. Additional camps are planned for Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan in the next phase. Dr. Halil Toker, Country Director of the Yunus Emre Institute in Pakistan, said that the Turkish people have a deep affection for Pakistanis and that efforts are being made to pass this sentiment on to the younger generation through educational and cultural programmes. During the event, children performed two Turkish songs and shared two jokes by Molla Nasreddin. Certificates were distributed among the participants. Parents and AIOU faculty members were also present at the ceremony.",
