    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP): Federal Minister for Health, Syed Mustufa Kamal on Tuesday reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring real-time disease surveillance and data accuracy across the country. He said this during a visit to the Sehat Sahulat Program's data centre established by State Life Insurance Corporation at State Life Tower. He was accompanied by the Additional Secretary of Health and the Joint Secretary of Health. The Chief Executive Officer, Federal Sehat Sahulat Program Muhammad Arshad and the Divisional Head (H&AI) of State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan Muhammad Ashar gave a briefing on the functions and operations of the data centre. The Minister also toured the E-Claims Centre. The CEO, SSP informed that Sehat Sahulat Program has introduced a paperless environment through digitalization of the program since day one and is using CNIC as Universal Medical Record. Mustafa Kamal stated that Pakistan currently lacks a Universal Medical Record system, making it difficult to trace a patient's medical history. He emphasized the need to develop a Universal Medical Record system for non-Sehat Card patients as well within the National Database of the Sehat Sahulat Program, where every citizen's Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) number would serve as their medical record number. This would allow real-time, comprehensive health data of all 240 million citizens of Pakistan to be recorded and accessed. He stated that such a system would significantly improve access to healthcare, enabling doctors to instantly retrieve patients' medical histories, which in turn facilitates timely diagnosis and treatment. He said that quick access to accurate healthcare data leads to better health outcomes and that comprehensive and authentic health data would support the Ministry in formulating more effective public health policies. The minister appreciated the efforts of Federal Sehat Sahulat Program and State Life teams for their wonderful work.",
