    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP):Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit Baltistan and State and Frontier Regions (SAFRON) and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) Provincial President Engineer Amir Muqam and Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi here on Tuesday discussed the prevailing political situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. During the meeting, both leaders expressed deep concern over the lack of good governance, worsening law and order, and what they termed as record-breaking corruption under the current provincial administration. They described the present provincial government as highly detrimental to the interests of the province. The two leaders also consulted on the Supreme Court's recent verdict on reserved seats and its implications for the political landscape in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Issues related to Kashmir, the situation in the merged tribal districts, and the misuse of federal funds allocated for these areas by the provincial government were also discussed. The leaders condemned what they called the provincial administration's misappropriation of these funds and emphasized the need to address the growing concerns of the people in the merged districts.",
