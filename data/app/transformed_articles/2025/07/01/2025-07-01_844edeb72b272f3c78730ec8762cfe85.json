    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP): As Pakistan faces intensifying heatwaves and climate threats, Freedom Gate Prosperity (FGP), in collaboration with the Jurist Panel, is all set to host the \"National Climate Dialogue 2025: Climate Resilience - A Discussion Amidst Extreme Heatwave\" on Thursday, July 3, under its Climate Change Advocacy Initiative, focusing on resilience strategies. The session, scheduled from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM at the FGP Conference Room in Islamabad, aims to advance a coordinated legal and policy response to the escalating climate crisis. The two-hour hybrid dialogue would convene legal experts, environmental advocates, policymakers, and institutional stakeholders from across Pakistan, both in-person and virtually. The event will spotlight Pakistan's acute climate vulnerabilities, with a focus on the legal and governance shortcomings that hinder effective climate response. Panelists will present actionable recommendations to improve legal accountability, institutional coordination, and policy implementation. The outcomes of the dialogue were expected to feed into future legislative advocacy and national climate strategies. The event welcomes participation from legal professionals, environmental experts, civil society members, and media representatives.",
