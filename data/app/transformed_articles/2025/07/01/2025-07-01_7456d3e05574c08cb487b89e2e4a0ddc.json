The Managing Director PPRA, Hasnat Ahmed Qureshi, formally inaugurated the piloting of the system during a ceremony held at the Project Management Unit (PMU) EPADS, here on Tuesday, said a press release. The pilot phase of the system commenced with the Pakistan Customs and the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training. Following the inaugural ceremony, a three-day training session was organized for Master Trainers on the e-Disposal Module. The capacity-building initiative was attended by 26 officials from Pakistan Customs and the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training-two of the first institutions engaged in the pilot phase. On this occasion, MD PPRA appreciated the efforts of the PMU team and encouraged participants to fully utilize the system and provide constructive feedback. He emphasized that the feedback would be instrumental in refining the system before its rollout across all procuring agencies. Mr. Qureshi further highlighted that, in line with the Prime Minister's vision of Digital Pakistan, PPRA has successfully digitised the national public procurement landscape through EPADS.
