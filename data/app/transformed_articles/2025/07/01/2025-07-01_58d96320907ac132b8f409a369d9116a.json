    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP):In a powerful display of diplomatic warmth and cultural solidarity, Ethiopian Ambassador Dr Jemal Beker and Pakistan's Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Muhammad Aurangzeb Khichi in a meeting held here Tuesday pledged to transform the historical goodwill between their nations into a dynamic cultural partnership. Calling Pakistan \"a nation of courage, hospitality, and rich traditions,\" Ambassador Beker expressed deep admiration for the country and underscored the potential of cultural diplomacy to bring the two peoples closer. The meeting witnessed a candid and visionary dialogue on joint cultural ventures, formal agreements, and people-to-people exchanges. Welcoming the envoy, Aurangzeb Khichi reiterated Pakistan's commitment to cultural cooperation, emphasizing the Ministry's active role in preserving and promoting the country's diverse heritage. He noted that Pakistan and Ethiopia could serve as cultural gateways between South Asia and Africa. The ambassador proposed signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) to guide future collaboration and also suggested that cultural exchange could be a catalyst for enhancing bilateral trade - a proposal welcomed by the minister. A significant outcome of the meeting was the announcement that \"Medemer Generation\", a book authored by Ethiopian Prime Minister Dr Abiy Ahmed, has been added to Pakistan's National Library under the \"African Corner Initiative.\" The National Languages Promotion Department will translate the book into Urdu to further strengthen cultural understanding. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to nurturing cultural ties, creating new platforms for cooperation, and building a strong, people-centric bridge between Ethiopia and Pakistan.",
