The MoU was signed by Secretary ECP, Omar Hamid Khan, and Vice Chancellor FJWU, Prof. Dr. Bushra Mirza, in the presence of Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and members of the Commission. Addressing the ceremony, Chief Election Commissioner, Sikandar Sultan Raja stated that this collaboration represented a strategic alliance focused on civic education and inclusivity.
