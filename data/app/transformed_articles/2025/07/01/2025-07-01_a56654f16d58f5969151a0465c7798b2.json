    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP):Capital Development Authority (CDA) Board has decided to consult the Establishment and Cabinet Divisions for legal guidance on integrating maintenance staff transferred from the Public Works Department (PWD) into the CDA structure. The decision was taken during the Board's 12th meeting, chaired by CDA Chairman and Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa on Tuesday. The Board directed that a set of recommendations be drafted after thoroughly reviewing all legal frameworks. The meeting also approved a comprehensive feasibility plan to operationalize the Gandhara Heritage and Cultural Centre at F-9 Park. Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa stated, \"The revenue generated from this center will be invested back into the city for public welfare, better civic amenities, and Islamabad's overall beautification and development.\" Legal matters were also on the agenda. The Board approved the issuance of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Plot No. 676D-12/2, in compliance with the Islamabad High Court's directive in Writ Petition No. 2214/2022 titled \"Hasan Bano vs FGEHA and Others.\" In another land-related decision, the Board accepted a request by the Motamar Al-Alam Al-Islami to return an allocated plot in Sector H-8. CDA clarified that while it would refund the original allotment amount, the current market value of the returned plot is significantly higher. Additionally, the Board approved an alternate plot allocation in exchange for Plot No. 39 in Sector I-10/3, again in accordance with the Islamabad High Court's instructions. Chairman Randhawa emphasized the CDA's commitment to making Islamabad a model city. \"CDA is deploying all available resources to ensure the capital's growth, prosperity, and aesthetic appeal while meeting the residential, transportation, and recreational needs of its citizens,\" he said. One of the key discussions centered on the transfer fee, registration charges, and stamp duty applicable to urban and rural properties within CDA and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) limits, including private housing societies Senior officials, including CDA Board members and the Deputy Commissioner Islamabad, attended the meeting.",
