The commitment came during a meeting between Malaysian Ambassador Mohd Syafik Firdaus Hasbullah and Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture Muhammad Aurangzeb Khichi, held here on Monday. Ambassador Hasbullah lauded Pakistan's efforts in safeguarding its diverse cultural legacy and praised its ongoing role in strengthening people-to-people ties. He underscored Malaysia's desire to enhance cultural diplomacy and deepen engagement with Pakistan through meaningful artistic exchanges. Aurangzeb Khichi, reaffirming Pakistan's commitment, highlighted the country's institutional capacity to host joint cultural events, exhibitions, and heritage collaborations. He welcomed the Ambassador's formal invitation to visit Malaysia and emphasized the importance of such bilateral interactions in promoting shared values and traditions. A key highlight of the meeting was the discussion on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the first time in Pakistan to preserve and promote the ancient Gandhara Civilization-marking a transformative step in heritage conservation through digital innovation. Both sides also expressed interest in organizing joint cultural performances and dance showcases featuring artists from both countries, which would allow the public to experience the richness of Malaysian culture alongside Pakistan's diverse traditions. Appreciating the unique cultural identity of Punjab, Aurangzeb Khichi invited the Malaysian envoy to explore the region's historic sites-an offer welcomed with enthusiasm.
