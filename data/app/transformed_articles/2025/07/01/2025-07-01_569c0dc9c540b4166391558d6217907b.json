    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP): In a sweeping effort to reclaim public spaces, Islamabad's district administration has launched a citywide operation to remove illegal encroachments. From billboards to roadside stalls and vehicles parked on green belts, the ICT administration officials worked late into the night to clear key areas across the federal capital said the spokesman of ICT administration here. He said that Islamabad's district administration has intensified its campaign against encroachments across the city, initiating a large-scale operation that continued well into the night. Assistant commissioners from all zones took part in the effort, targeting illegal structures, billboards, parking, and stalls in various sectors and busy roads. As part of the operation, more than 100 billboards were removed from Lehtrar Road alone. Large hoardings were also taken down from Korang Road. The administration reported that these structures had been installed without permission and were obstructing both pedestrian and vehicular movement. In PWD, unauthorized roadside stalls were dismantled, with officials clearing pathways and ensuring roads remained accessible to the public. During the operation, over 20 individuals involved in setting up or maintaining encroachments were detained and shifted to police custody. In the Koral area, construction material stored in the service lane was removed to clear the passage. Authorities emphasized that storing construction equipment in public areas was unlawful and posed safety risks. Outside car showrooms in sector G-8, vehicles parked on footpaths were shifted to a nearby government school to free up the walkways. In sector F-10, an entire showroom was sealed due to illegal car parking practices. Six vehicles were confiscated and shifted to the local police station. Green belt areas were also a focus of the operation. In sector G-5, encroachments on green spaces were completely removed, allowing for the restoration of the area to its original purpose. Deputy Commissioner Islamabad said that the operation will continue until all encroachments across the city are removed. The administration has issued a clear message that any obstruction in public areas-whether in the form of stalls, structures, vehicles, or materials-will not be tolerated. The crackdown aims to ensure the smooth flow of traffic, pedestrian access, and the restoration of public spaces for their intended use. Authorities have urged residents and business owners to cooperate and remove any unauthorized structures voluntarily. The administration has also indicated that future operations may expand to other sectors and markets, particularly in areas where repeated violations have been reported. According to officials, this campaign is part of broader efforts to improve urban management, maintain public safety, and uphold the law within Islamabad's municipal boundaries. The district administration has committed to monitoring cleared areas to prevent the return of encroachments. Regular follow-up inspections are planned to ensure long-term compliance. The Deputy Commissioner stated that public complaints and reports of encroachments can be submitted to the relevant assistant commissioner offices or through the district administration's online platforms. The ongoing operation signals a firm stance by Islamabad's authorities to maintain order and reclaim public infrastructure.",
