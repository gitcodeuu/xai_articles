The councillors expressed their full support for promoting economic, trade, educational and social relations between Pakistan and the UK. The speakers made proposals to further mobilize the Pakistani community in the UK. In his remarks, Dr. Faisal said British-origin Pakistanis were our \"cultural ambassadors\" who reflected values such as hard work, dedication and perseverance. He said the strength of our nation abroad was reflected in the dignity, unity and service of the diaspora. \"Pakistan's progress is attached to your progress,\" he added. Dr. Faisal said some negative elements tried to malign the Pakistani community for nefarious purposes. \"We will fight these elements together.\" The High Commissioner urged the councillors to highlight the achievements of British Pakistanis, especially women and youth, in education, business, health and public service. British Pakistani youth should play a vital role in promoting Pakistan's cultural heritage and strengthening Pakistan's economy, he stressed. The High Commissioner reiterated his commitment to serve the Pakistani community fully through consular services and by improving bilateral relations. The British Pakistani community should present Pakistan to the world as a sovereign, resilient and progressive nation, he added.",
