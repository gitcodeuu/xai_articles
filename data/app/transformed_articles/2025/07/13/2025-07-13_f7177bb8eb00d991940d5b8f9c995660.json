Talking to a local news channel, Spokesperson said that according to the latest weather predictions by the Meteorological Department, the third spell of monsoon is expected to begin on Monday. He warned that this could lead to heavy rainfall in several regions, increasing the risk of urban and flash flooding in vulnerable areas. Dr. Shah advised the public to stay vigilant, avoid unnecessary travel during heavy rain and strictly refrain from crossing flooded roads, streams, or bridges. He also urged local authorities to remain on high alert and ensure that emergency response mechanisms are fully operational to deal with any situation promptly. He said real-time monitoring of weather patterns, water levels and vulnerable locations is actively underway to ensure a swift response to any developing situation.
