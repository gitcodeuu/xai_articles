    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 13 (APP)::The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), primarily known for its grand infrastructure, ports, roads, and power plants, is now catalyzing a deeper, more human transformation: the emergence of women as drivers of Pakistanas economic future. As the corridor enters its next phase, it is the significant number of women, trained across the country under CPEC-linked initiatives, who are poised to take the lead, reshaping industries, uplifting communities, and ensuring that the promise of progress is shared more equally than ever before. In Tharparkar, Sindh, women are breaking barriers under the flagship of CPEC. Through the Thar Block II Project of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), up to 70 women have been trained as heavy dump truck drivers, a first for this traditionally conservative and underprivileged region. Similar stories are emerging from Balochistanas coastal city of Gwadar, where over 20 women have been trained in garment production at a tailoring center inside the Gwadar Port Free Zone. Supported by China Overseas Ports Holding Company (COPHC) and the Chinese Consulate, the initiative provides women with stipends as they produce uniforms for port workers. Speaking exclusively to APP, Umair Pervez Khan, Secretary of the Consortium of Asia Pacific Studies (CAPS), noted that CPEC is evolving from an infrastructure-focused vision to a human-centered model of inclusive and sustainable development. aCPEC is not just about roads and trade,a he said. aIt is a platform of opportunity, and women are at the heart of this transformation.a According to Pervez Khan, the second phase of CPEC focuses on sustainable development, special economic zones (SEZs), vocational training, and community empowerment. aWe are witnessing the start of a social shift. Women who once had no access to education or income opportunities are now contributing to their local economies with skill and dedication,a he noted clearly impressed. As SEZs become operational in various provinces, policymakers and development partners are working to integrate womenas roles into industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and operationsasectors traditionally dominated by men. Pervez Khan emphasized that CPECas long-term success depends on the inclusion of women at all levels of economic activity, particularly within SEZs like Rashakai and Dhabeji. aThe only way forward is to build inclusion into the foundation of our economic zonesaso women are part of the system from the start,a he said. He also stressed the need for vocational centers, daycare facilities, and women-friendly work environments to become standard features in all SEZs, to support womenas participation and retention in the workforce. Beyond income generation, CPEC is also reshaping social attitudes. In regions where womenas mobility and public presence were once highly restricted, local success stories are inspiring communities and creating new pathways for young women to find employment. aThese early achievements need support through awareness campaigns and local partnerships,aA UmairA Khan said. aWhen one woman steps forward, it encourages others. That ripple effect can only last with continued community engagement and recognition.a Khan believes Pakistan can set a regional example through CPEC by promoting gender-inclusive development. aWith inclusive policies, Pakistan can use infrastructure and trade to uplift not just GDP, but human lives,a he remarked. Across the country, progress is already visible. In Sindh, 70 women are trained as dump truck drivers in Tharparkar, while 21 others work in solar maintenance. In Balochistan, over 20 women are employed and trained at the Gwadar Women Garment Factory. In Punjab, improved energy access in SEZs has boosted female employment in the textile sector. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, better transport links have opened urban jobs and training opportunities for women. Additionally, 191 female police officers have joined Sindhas CPEC security force. As the Pak-China partnership advances under the Belt and Road Initiative, this multi-billion dollar corridor is connecting Pakistan to global markets while driving regional growth. Now focused on sustainability and inclusion, it is empowering women in remote areas with skills and opportunities, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to both the national and global economy. Their role is no longer secondary, it is central to lasting progress.",
