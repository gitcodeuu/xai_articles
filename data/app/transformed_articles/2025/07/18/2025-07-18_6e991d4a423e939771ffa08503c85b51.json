The House passed all the bills through clause by clause readings. The Statement of objects and Reasons of the Extradition (Amendment ) Bill says that the extradition requests are received from foreign jurisdictions through diplomatic channels.

The statement of objects and reasons the Pakistan Citizen (Amendment) bill says that a large number of Pakistani diaspora are complaining that they had to renounce their Pakistani citizenship as a condition for acquiring citizenship of a foreign country for residence or stay. Whenever such countries are entering into dual nationality arrangements with government of Pakistan, there is no provision within Pakistan Citizenship Act 1951 which allows resumption of Pakistan citizenship. The amendment will allow Pakistani diaspora to resume their Pakistani citizenship. The statement of objects and reasons of the Federal Board (Amendment) bill says that the act has been amended to provide a comprehensive framework for the Board to organize, regulate, conduct and overseas intermediate and secondary education in line with best practices. The proposed amendments aim to facilitate swift and flexible decision making while enabling the Board to establish international collaboration.
