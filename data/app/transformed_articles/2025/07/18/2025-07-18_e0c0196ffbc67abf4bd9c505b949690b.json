    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control and the world over will observe the Accession to Pakistan Day tomorrow (Saturday) with a renewed pledge to continue the plebiscite struggle for Jammu and Kashmir and its complete merger with Pakistan. It was on 19th July 1947 that genuine representatives of the Kashmiris unanimously passed resolution of Kashmir's Accession to Pakistan during a meeting of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference at the residence of Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan in Abi Guzar area of Srinagar, Hurriyat Leader APHC Abdul Hameed Lone said. The historic resolution called for the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan in view of its existing sentiments, religious, geographical, cultural and economic proximity to Pakistan and aspirations of millions of the Jammu and Kashmir people. The development had come almost a month before the creation of two sovereign states of Pakistan and India under the Partition Plan of the British Indian colony. As per the understanding behind the Partition Plan, the Princely States were free to accede to either of the two newly established countries. The decision of 19th July 1947 was a testimony to the fact that the people of Kashmir had linked their future with Pakistan. They took the decision of joining Pakistan to protect their political, religious, social, cultural and economic rights, as they were well aware of their fate under Hindus who had deep-seated animosity for Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir, he added. The dream of merging with Pakistan, rooted in the July 19, 1947 resolution, remains alive and strong among Kashmir and it is from 1947 that Kashmiris uphold their July 19 pledge with unmatched resilience. The 1947 accession resolution is not just history; it's the foundation of Kashmiris' resistance and continues to inspire Kashmiris' fight for freedom and rightful alignment with Pakistan. This Accession to Pakistan spirit fuels the Kashmiris' legitimate quest for the right to self-determination.",
