    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said on Friday that he had requested the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to restore Shalimar Recording and Broadcasting Company. Talking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, he said that he had presented his position in the court. He said the process of SRBC liquidation had started much before he assumed office as Minister for Information and Broadcasting. \"The company has more than 300 employees, it is necessary to restore the company to protect their jobs,\" Attaullah Tarar remarked. The court has issued orders to submit a business plan, Tarar said, adding it has also directed the liquidator to pay the salaries of the SRBC employees. Attaullah Tarar said a previous government caused billions of rupees of losses to Pakistan International Airlines by making irresponsible statements. He said by the grace of God that PIA flights to Europe and the UK have been restored due to the efforts of the present government. He said that Pakistani airlines' flights to Europe were being restored in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz era. To a question, he replied that incompetence was at its peak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \"Corruption, mismanagement are on the rise in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,\" Attaullah opined. The minister said the PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not save the tourists stranded in the Swat River due to rampant corruption and inefficiency.",
