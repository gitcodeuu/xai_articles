    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):The Senate was informed on Friday that a total of 11,448,517 workers were registered with the Employees' Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI), and registration cards had been issued to all. During the Question Hour, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, responding on behalf of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, said that although the EOBI website does not update registration in real-time, steps were being taken to ensure automatic online data integration. The number of insured workers had since risen to approximately 11.6 million. In reply to a supplementary question from Senator Danesh Kumar, the minister said details regarding insurance entitlements, affiliated companies, hospital access, and posthumous benefits would be furnished in writing. To another question by Senator Shahadat Awan, he clarified that mine workers were included in the EOBI system and their registration was being handled through provincial setups. He also stated that a special committee, constituted on the directives of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, was actively working to register domestic workers across the country. Barrister Aqeel Malik further stated that a 15% increase in EOBI pensions had recently been approved by the federal government. Responding to a query from Senator Masroor Ahsan regarding EOBI-owned properties, the minister informed the House that the institution currently holds 49 buildings nationwide: Punjab (24), Sindh (14), Islamabad (5), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (4), and Balochistan (2). He added that 40 buildings were being used as rented spaces for regional and field offices. Senator Zameer Hussain Ghumro raised the issue of EOBI devolution to the provinces. The minister responded that the matter would be placed before the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and resolved in accordance with constitutional provisions. Senator Masroor Ahsan pointed out that the data did not include plots owned by EOBI despite contributions made by both employers and employees. He suggested that the issue be referred to a relevant Senate committee. The minister responded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vision for workers' welfare was reflected in initiatives like the reactivation of the National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) to expedite dispute resolution. He said details regarding EOBI plots would also be submitted shortly. In a separate question, Senator Abdul Shakoor Khan asked how the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis had made appointments during a general hiring ban. Senator Shakoor also highlighted concerns about limited representation from Balochistan. The minister responded that recruitment was conducted on open merit and local basis and also accommodated minority quotas. Senator Danesh Kumar criticized the absence of reserved quotas for women and persons with disabilities. Responding to this, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said that all public sector recruitment was now carried out through a structured mechanism, including written tests and interviews, and that appointments were strictly merit-based. He emphasized that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vision was clear: all government hiring must adhere to transparency and merit. \"No appointment should be made on verbal orders or bypassing due process,\" he added. The minister further said that disadvantaged regions-such as Balochistan, interior Sindh, southern Punjab, and parts of KP-were being prioritized. He noted a one-time age relaxation in CSS exams, along with coaching provided at the Civil Services Academy for underrepresented areas. He also criticized the declining standards of education in some private universities, stating that substandard degrees were a threat to the future of public service. He said the government was committed to improving quality and fairness across the system.",
