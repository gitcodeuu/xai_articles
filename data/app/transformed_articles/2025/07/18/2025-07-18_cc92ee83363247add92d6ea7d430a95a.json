    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday expressed his gratitude as the country's current account surplus reached $2.1 billion in the fiscal year 2024-2025 - the highest ever during the last 22 years. The prime minister, in a statement, called the surge in current account surplus \"highly encouraging development\", and said that the government's strategic measures led to a boost in foreign exchange reserves to over $19 billion. He said that stability in the current account surplus was primarily driven by a substantial increase in remittances and exports. Prime Minister Shehbaz said that the improving financial and economic indicators demonstrated that Pakistan's economy was on the path to stability. The government was prioritizing measures to enhance the business and investor-friendly environment in the country, he said, and also commended the efforts of the government's economic team in this journey.",
