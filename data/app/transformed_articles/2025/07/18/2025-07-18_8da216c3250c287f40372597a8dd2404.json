    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP): In response to recent heavy rains and flood-related emergencies across various parts of the country, the National Highway Authority (NHA) has issued a high alert and established a central control room at its headquarters here. Chairman NHA Sheheryar Sultan instructed all relevant members, general managers, project directors, and field staff to remain fully alert with necessary machinery and equipment at flood-affected locations. In a letter, he said that the engineers, officers and concerned staff should be present in the flood-affected areas at all times to carry out relief operations and restore all kinds of traffic so that the restoration works in the affected areas can be completed on time. Emergency response teams have been immediately deployed in flood-affected areas and will maintain real-time communication with the NHA control room to report ground conditions and provide operational updates. Chairman Shehryar Sultan also directed NHA officials to ensure timely and accurate public information through social media, FM radio, and television channels, so that citizens in affected regions are kept informed of road conditions and safety advisories. He further instructed that NHA teams coordinate closely with local district administrations, especially in the event of road closures, infrastructure damage, or other emergencies. The goal, he said, is to ensure a swift and organized response in collaboration with civil authorities. Chairman NHA also called upon field officials deployed in critical zones to prioritize traveler safety and play a key role in emergency assistance. He stressed that during storm and flood conditions, public relief, road restoration, and rescue efforts must take precedence over all other operations. Reaffirming his personal oversight, Chairman Sultan said he is conducting emergency visits to affected areas to assess ongoing relief efforts, ensuring strict accountability and no room for negligence during this national emergency.",
