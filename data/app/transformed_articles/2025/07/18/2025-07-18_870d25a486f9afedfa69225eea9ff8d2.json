    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday reserved its verdict on students petition against the order for termination of summer session by Quaid-e-Azam University and the vacating of hostels. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro reserved the decision on the students' petition. During the hearing, the petitioner's lawyer said that the principle was fixed that the child would improve in the summer session. The university's registrar said that there are dues which have not been paid yet. 1138 students are illegally residing in hostels. We have to restore our writ. Children start protesting after some time. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro said that the children should sit and study. What are they doing? It does not seem right that the police have put handcuffs on them. The petitioner's lawyer said that will they do this to all the children because of two or four students? Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro asked the university officials, \"Are you parents, do parents do this to their children?\" Yes, you filed FIRs against the students. The university registrar said that we had to file the FIR under compulsion, the hostel is in a bad condition, he is not fit to live in, in the previous fight they had burnt the hostel. The petitioner lawyer said that the hostel fee challans should be called, the summer fee has been taken. The university lawyer said that they will not suffer any harm in terms of education. The university registrar said that the summer session is for two months, now the time is less. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro asked the university registrar if you do not want to fight, then do not respond. The court reserved the decision on the students' request.",
