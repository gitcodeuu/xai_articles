    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engr Amir Muqam has issued a special message on the occasion of Youm-e-Ilhaq-e-Pakistan, reaffirming Pakistan's unwavering support to the Kashmiri people's legitimate struggle for self-determination and their historic decision to accede to Pakistan. Highlighting the significance of the day, Amir Muqam said that July 19, 1947 marks a defining moment in the history of Jammu and Kashmir, when the people of the region, through a unanimous resolution passed by the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference, decided to join Pakistan based on religious, cultural, and geographical affinities. \"Despite fighting three wars with India, Pakistan continues to uphold its principled stance for a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions,\" he stated. Amir Muqam condemned the decades-long Indian military occupation of Jammu and Kashmir, terming it a blatant denial of the Kashmiri people's fundamental rights. \"India's brutal oppression and continuous violations of human rights have only strengthened the resolve of Kashmiris, who have repeatedly expressed their desire to join Pakistan,\" he added. He reiterated Pakistan's commitment to extending unwavering moral, political, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people until their just demand for a UN-mandated plebiscite is fulfilled. \"On this historic day, we salute the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people and assure them that Pakistan will never abandon their cause. The dream of Ilhaq-e-Pakistan remains alive in the hearts of every Kashmiri,\" Amir Muqam concluded.",
