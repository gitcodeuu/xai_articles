    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):Pakistan on Friday strongly reiterated its unwavering commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, calling for objective and collective global action against the menace, while rejecting politically motivated narratives aimed at maligning the country. In a press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pakistan emphasized that zero tolerance for terrorism and robust international cooperation remain central to its counter-terrorism (CT) policy. \"Pakistan has been, and continues to be, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism,\" the statement read, highlighting the country's significant contributions to global peace, including the recent apprehension of Sharifullah - the terrorist mastermind behind the deadly Abbey Gate bombing. Commenting on the ongoing investigations into the Pahalgam incident in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJ&K), the Ministry noted that the inquiry remains inconclusive. It categorically rejected any links to the banned outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), asserting that such claims do not align with ground realities. \"Pakistan has effectively dismantled such defunct organizations, arrested and prosecuted their leadership, and undertaken extensive deradicalization efforts,\" the statement clarified. The Foreign Office also criticized India for its repeated attempts to misuse international designations to propagate anti-Pakistan narratives. \"India has a track record of exploiting such matters to divert global attention from its own irresponsible and rogue conduct, particularly its grave human rights violations in IIOJ&K,\" the spokesperson stated. Underscoring the need for an impartial and inclusive international approach to counter-terrorism, Pakistan urged the global community to adopt non-discriminatory policies. It also called for the inclusion of groups like the Majeed Brigade under global terrorist designations, noting its affiliation with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). The statement concluded by reaffirming Pakistan's role as a counter-terrorism bulwark, achieved through unmatched sacrifices and operational successes, and reiterated the country's commitment to a peaceful and secure world through shared efforts.",
