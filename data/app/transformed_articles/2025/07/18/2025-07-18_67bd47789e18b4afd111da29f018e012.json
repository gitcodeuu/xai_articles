The meeting underscored minister's vision to forge new international agricultural alliances that align with Pakistan's strategic objectives of enhancing food security, boosting investment, and promoting South-South cooperation, said a press release. During the meeting, the minister emphasized the deep-rooted cultural, religious, and historical ties between Pakistan and Sudan, describing them as a solid foundation for stronger collaboration in agricultural trade, education, and technology. The minister highlighted Pakistan's advanced research institutions and technical expertise in crop production, irrigation, and livestock health as ideal resources for Sudan's agricultural development ambitions. The Sudanese Ambassador informed the minister about Sudan's demographic composition, stating that over 98% of its population practices Islam, and reaffirmed the goodwill and trust that exists between the two nations. Rana Tanveer Hussain took note of the current geopolitical situation in Sudan and appreciated the country's efforts to maintain peace in the post-secession era. He reiterated Pakistan's readiness to cooperate in humanitarian and development domains through sustainable agriculture-based solutions. The minister welcomed Sudan's keen interest in educational collaboration, particularly in securing additional seats for Sudanese students at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. He assured the Ambassador that the ministry would coordinate with relevant educational bodies to support Sudan's human resource development in agri-sciences. The minister acknowledged the potential for a tri-party collaboration involving Sudan, Pakistan, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He termed the proposal of launching joint agricultural ventures using Sudan's fertile lands, Pakistani expertise, and Saudi investment as \"a visionary step toward regional food security.\" He expressed particular interest in Sudan's sugar industry and meat exports, encouraging Pakistani private sector stakeholders to explore investment in sugar processing, technology transfer, and slaughterhouse infrastructure. Rana Tanveer further noted the health standards upheld by Sudan in its livestock exports to Gulf markets and recognized the country's strength in producing disease-free meat. He encouraged closer cooperation in veterinary science, breeding, and poultry management, ensuring Pakistan's support in providing technical assistance where needed. The minister also appreciated the contribution of the Pakistani diaspora in Sudan, especially in skilled trades and technical services. He said their presence is a living example of the mutual trust and benefit shared between the two brotherly nations. Reaffirming his commitment to transforming Pakistan into a hub of international agricultural cooperation, Rana Tanveer stated that such partnerships will not only contribute to regional prosperity but also align with Pakistan's broader agenda of achieving sustainable development through strategic diplomacy and innovation in agriculture.",
