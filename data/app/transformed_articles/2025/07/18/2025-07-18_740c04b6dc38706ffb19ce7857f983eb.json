    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry held a telephonic conversation with the Chief Minister of Balochistan to discuss the scope and strategic importance of launching a ferry service from Gwadar to Gulf region. The conversation took place during a high-level meeting chaired by the Minister to review the progress on the proposed ferry service, said a press release issued here on Friday. The chief minister assured full cooperation from the Balochistan government, highlighting the potential socio-economic benefits for the province and beyond. The meeting also reviewed proposals submitted by five private ferry operators. These proposals outlined the technical, operational, and financial aspects of launching new maritime routes from Gwadar. The envisioned ferry routes are expected to link Gwadar Port with key destinations in the Gulf region, offering an affordable and efficient alternative for both passenger travel and cargo transport. Minister Junaid Anwar stressed the strategic value of the initiative, noting that the service would not only reduce transportation costs but also boost regional trade integration and maritime activity. He emphasized that successful implementation of the project could significantly elevate Pakistan's maritime presence and transform Gwadar into a central hub in international sea trade networks. \"The ferry service will improve travel ease between Pakistan and Gulf states,\" the Minister said. \"It can position Gwadar as a vital link in regional connectivity and drive long-term economic development.\" The meeting concluded with instructions to conduct further evaluations of the submitted proposals. Authorities were directed to ensure that all regulatory, technical, and logistical considerations are fully addressed ahead of the ferry service launch.",
