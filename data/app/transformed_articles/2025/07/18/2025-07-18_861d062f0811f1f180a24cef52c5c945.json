    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Dr. Musadik Malik has pledged full government support for youth-led clean energy and carbon credit ventures, calling them essential to Pakistan's low-carbon future. His remarks came during a meeting in Islamabad on Friday with Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Zeb Jaffer and founders of emerging green startups. The minister met with representatives from Carbon Croft, a local carbon advisory firm helping businesses and institutions prepare for carbon market participation. The company is working to establish frameworks for carbon trading, aiming to position Pakistan within the global carbon finance ecosystem. Dr. Malik also engaged with Carbon Flora, a tech-driven startup striving to make carbon credits accessible to individuals through simplified digital platforms. The company aims to raise public awareness and promote personal involvement in climate action by encouraging everyday users to offset their carbon footprint. \"These youth-led ventures represent the kind of innovation we need to meet our climate goals,\" Dr. Malik said. \"The government is committed to supporting the development of carbon markets in Pakistan and empowering clean energy entrepreneurs to scale their solutions.\" Dr. Malik emphasized the need to create enabling policies and institutional support that would allow startups to thrive in the fast-evolving climate tech space. \"This is about much more than just emissions,\" he added. \"It's about building a green economy and giving our youth the tools to lead it.\" Stakeholders at the meeting agreed to continue working on collaborative models that ensure transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in Pakistan's approach to carbon markets and clean energy innovation. The meeting underscored the Ministry's growing focus on climate finance and clean tech innovation as part of Pakistan's broader environmental strategy. With global carbon markets gaining momentum under international climate agreements, Pakistan is eyeing new opportunities to generate revenue through emissions reductions while fostering green jobs at home.",
