    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP):The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast widespread rain-windstorms and thundershowers across most regions of the country on Tuesday, with heavy to very heavy falls expected in several areas, raising the risk of flash floods, urban flooding, and landslides. According to the forecast, rain-windstorm/thundershower is likely in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Islamabad, Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, north-eastern and south Balochistan, and parts of Sindh. Scattered heavyfalls are expected in Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Kashmir, and northeastern Balochistan. During the period from July 15 to 17, heavy to very heavy rains may generate flash floods in local streams and nullahs in Chitral, Swat, Murree, Galliyat, Rawalpindi, Mansehra, and other parts of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeast Punjab, northeastern Balochistan, and Kashmir. Vulnerable hilly regions such as KP, Murree, Galliyat, Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan may face landslides or mudslides, potentially resulting in road closures and disrupted transportation. Low-lying urban areas in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Multan, Sahiwal, and Peshawar are also at high risk of urban flooding due to intense rainfall. Strong winds are expected to accompany the storm system and may damage electric poles, trees, solar panels, vehicles, and standing crops. The public has been advised to remain alert and take precautionary measures. In Islamabad, cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, with periods of heavy rainfall likely. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rain and thunderstorms are forecast across districts including Chitral, Swat, Abbottabad, Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, and Waziristan, with the possibility of very heavy falls at times. Most parts of Punjab will see partly cloudy conditions with rain and windstorms expected in cities like Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, and Bahawalpur. Heavy rainfall is likely in northeast Punjab, the Potohar region, and parts of South Punjab. In Sindh, the weather will remain hot and very humid, although isolated rain is likely in areas including Umerkot, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and some coastal cities. Balochistan is expected to witness hot and humid conditions as well, with rain and thunderstorms likely in Barkhan, Zhob, Loralai, and Lasbela. Isolated heavy falls may occur in these areas, increasing the risk of flash floods. Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan will experience cloudy weather with rain and scattered heavyfalls in Kashmir, while Gilgit Baltistan will see isolated thunderstorms. Over the past 24 hours, rain and thunderstorms, including isolated heavyfalls, occurred in various parts of the country including Islamabad, Punjab, Lower Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeastern and southern Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Kashmir. The highest recorded rainfall was in Okara (158mm), followed by Sahiwal (71mm), DG Khan (51mm), and Bahawalnagar (39mm). In Sindh, Hyderabad received up to 53mm, while Saidu Sharif in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded 28mm. Islamabad's Saidpur area received 32mm of rain. Barkhan in Balochistan saw 13mm of rain, while Astore in Gilgit-Baltistan recorded 11mm. The highest temperatures were recorded in Turbat at 44 C, followed by Shaheed Benazirabad and Hyderabad at 41 C. The PMD urges the public, local authorities, and disaster management agencies to stay vigilant and prepared, especially in flood-prone and mountainous regions, as weather conditions are expected to intensify during the coming days.",
