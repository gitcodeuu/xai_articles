    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP): KP Provincial president of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, on Monday criticized Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)'s 12-year rule in the province, calling it the period marked by negligence, inefficiency and poor crisis response.During the press conference Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha alongwith Secretary General of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Humayun Khan and other leaders strongly condemned KP government's handling of the recent tragedy in which 18 tourists lost their lives after being stranded in the Swat river.\"For over two hours, these tourists cried for help just 100 feet from the riverbank, yet no rescue teams arrived,\" said Ali Shah.He also raised the question of availability of helicopter for rescue purpose.While on the contrary, he said that during PPP's tenure, swift rescue responses were ensured in such situations.\"We immediately dispatched helicopters and saved lives. This recent tragedy is a result of criminal negligence by the provincial government and administration. The Chief Minister must resign,\" he demanded.He further accused rescue, tourist and irrigation departments of KP province, also responsible for the Swat incident as they failed to take precautionary measures.He also held PTI-led government responsible for issuing No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to hotels built dangerously close to the Swat River, which he said also contributed to the disaster.Meanwhile, Humayun Khan remarked, \"PTI's ego has turned into negligence. Governance is a responsibility, not a platform for personal agendas.After 12 years in power, PTI has delivered nothing but disappointment.\" PPP leadership always came forward in support of people, he said.He noted that PPP leaders, including the Governor of KP, the Governor of Punjab and the Chairperson of the Benazir Income Support Programme, personally visited the families of the Swat victims.\"Governor KP even announced prizes for those who risked their lives to attempt rescue efforts,\" Humayun said.He also highlighted the security issues in Bajaur, which had claimed several lives recently.The PPP leadership reiterated their party's long-standing support for the people of Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas.",
