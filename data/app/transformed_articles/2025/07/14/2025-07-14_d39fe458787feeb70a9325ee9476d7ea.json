The approval was granted during a meeting of the Faculty Board held yesterday, chaired by Dean, Professor Dr. Abdul Aziz Sahir. In addition to the new undergraduate programmes, the Board also approved schemes of studies for various departments' postgraduate, BS, MPhil, and PhD programmes. Key decisions were taken regarding curriculum reforms, including revisions to existing courses and the inclusion of new subjects, said a press release issued here on Monday. Addressing the meeting, Professor Dr. Abdul Aziz Sahir emphasized that all academic programmes will be aligned with the contemporary educational and professional requirements in accordance with the Higher Education Commission (HEC) policies. He reiterated the university's commitment to quality education under the leadership of Vice Chancellor Professor Dr. Nasir Mahmood. Dr. Sahir further noted that, following government directives, Fahm-ul-Quran and Seerat-un-Nabi courses have already been included in all degree programmes. In the next phase, the university will introduce courses focused on Pakistani languages, aiming to promote the country's diverse linguistic and cultural heritage. He also instructed faculty members to ensure that all new academic programmes meet prescribed standards, including credit hours and policy compliance, before being submitted to the Academic Council for final approval.
