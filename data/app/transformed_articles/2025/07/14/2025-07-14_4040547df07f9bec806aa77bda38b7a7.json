    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP):Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP), using modern drone technology, has initiated smart monitoring on major highways-initially the Expressway and Srinagar Highway-resulting in fines issued to more than 300 traffic violators and awareness provided to over 350 citizens. An ITP spokesperson told APP on Monday that the enforcement campaign marks the first phase of ITP's strategy to ensure strict compliance with traffic laws through aerial surveillance. Violations such as lane discipline, illegal overtaking (girafting), overloading, and one-wheeling are being continuously monitored. He said that this ongoing crackdown involves real-time identification of violations via drones, followed by immediate action including issuance of fines and impoundment of vehicles. Several vehicles were shifted to police stations for serious infractions. He said the initiative not only helps in enforcing the law but also aids in spotting high-traffic zones, allowing ITP's special response teams to act promptly and manage congestion effectively. Chief Traffic Officer Captain (R) Syed Zeeshan Haider said that the next phase will expand drone operations across all sectors and additional major roads of Islamabad. \"Drone technology is proving highly effective in identifying violations instantly and ensuring swift, transparent enforcement,\" he added.",
