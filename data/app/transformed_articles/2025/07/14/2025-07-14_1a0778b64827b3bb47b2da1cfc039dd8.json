    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP): A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Housing and Works, chaired by Senator Nasir Mehmood Butt, was convened at the Shaheed-e-Millat Secretariat here on Monday to review pressing issues related to housing projects, maintenance delays, illegal occupations, and resource constraints affecting public facilities. The meeting was attended by Senators Husna Bano, Khalida Ateeb, Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee, Hidayatullah Khan, and Saifullah Abro, along with senior officials from the Pakistan Housing Authority (PHA) Foundation and other relevant departments. Expressing concern over the prolonged disrepair of lifts-some inactive since 2006-Senator Nasir Butt called for clarity and accountability regarding the persistent delays in maintenance. \"This committee's foremost purpose is to serve the public interest and support development-not obstruct it,\" he stated. PHA officials reported that out of the six lifts, two have been made operational following essential repairs, three are undergoing installation, and one is still under construction. The committee also discussed the illegal occupation of government property. A significant case highlighted was the 38-kanal land in Murree, which had been unlawfully occupied. The PHA Chairman informed the committee that legal proceedings were initiated in the Islamabad High Court, resulting in the eviction of illegal occupants. The department is now recovering compensation in the form of rent for the duration of the illegal occupation. Senator Nasir Butt appreciated this action, terming it a \"successful recovery effort that must serve as an example for other cases.\" The committee further debated the deteriorating state of the Public Works Department (PWD), with some members suggesting it might be shut down altogether due to inefficiency. However, Senator Butt cautioned, \"Before making any decision, we must consider the future of the employees dependent on this department.\" He directed that this matter be included in the agenda for the next meeting to seek a comprehensive solution. Addressing another issue, the committee reviewed ongoing parking space projects, highlighting that the allocated Rs. 154 million was insufficient to complete the planned work. It was recommended that additional budgetary allocations be considered to ensure the timely completion of these vital public convenience projects. Wrapping up the proceedings, Senator Nasir Butt reiterated the committee's resolve: \"We will continue to monitor progress, ensure transparency, and push for the timely completion of public welfare projects. People's needs must remain our top priority.\" The meeting concluded with a strong message to all relevant departments to expedite pending projects, curb illegal encroachments, and deliver services efficiently in the larger public interest.",
