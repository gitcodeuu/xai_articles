    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 3 (APP):The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication will provide high-speed internet and fiber-optic connectivity to 532 schools in Islamabad. According to an official from the Ministry, the government has declared early education in artificial intelligence (AI), computer science, and emerging technologies a national priority. This move is part of the Prime Minister's vision for a \"Digital Nation Pakistan,\" focused on building a skilled and future-ready workforce. The government is also working to improve the quality of education, aiming to help school and college graduates become more employable. To support this, a high-level committee has been formed to review the current IT curriculum, emphasizing job-oriented skills. Although education is provincial, the Higher Education Commission (HEC), the Ministry of Education, and the National Curriculum Council are jointly upgrading the national syllabus. As part of these reforms, the government is reviewing AI and IT curricula for students from grade 6 to 12. Over 100 model schools and colleges have already been equipped with smart classrooms, labs, and digital screens. The government also plans to expand digital education to remote areas through EdTech and hybrid learning models. Starting this academic year, AI education will be formally introduced in all schools in the federal area. So far, over 1,000 teachers have received basic AI training, with more advanced training planned for the summer holidays. The government also aims to include private sector EdTech startups and young entrepreneurs in the national education system to boost innovation and expand reach.",
