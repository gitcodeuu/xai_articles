    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry emphasized the critical need to build strong partnerships with global organizations to safeguard marine ecosystems and effectively address escalating environmental challenges along Pakistan's coastline. He shared these views during a meeting with Mahmood Akhtar Cheema, Country Representative of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), who called on him at his office. IUCN is a global organization working for nature conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources. The discussion focused on enhancing collaboration to conserve Pakistan's marine and coastal biodiversity while promoting sustainable development within the maritime sector. The minister highlighted the severe pressures climate change exerts on coastal areas and stressed the urgent need to mobilize climate finance for biodiversity conservation projects. He stated that such efforts are essential not only for fulfilling Pakistan's international environmental commitments but also for strengthening resilience in coastal communities vulnerable to climate impacts. Minister Junaid Chaudhry requested IUCN's technical support for implementing the Astola Island Management Plan and acknowledged the organization's role in refining the national Maritime Policy. He also underscored eco-tourism's potential to advance environmental protection alongside socio-economic development for local populations. Mahmood Akhtar Cheema offered IUCN's expertise to align Pakistan's tourism strategies with global best practices in nature-based tourism and sustainable marine resource management. Both parties identified pollution and untreated wastewater discharge as significant threats to marine life, prompting the Minister to advocate for modern water treatment infrastructure. IUCN committed to assisting in designing environmentally sound coastal wastewater management technologies. The minister stressed the importance of involving local communities in conservation planning and execution to ensure inclusive and sustainable outcomes. Mahmood Akhtar Cheema also presented IUCN's latest annual report to the Minister, reaffirming the organization's dedication to supporting Pakistan's blue economy objectives.",
