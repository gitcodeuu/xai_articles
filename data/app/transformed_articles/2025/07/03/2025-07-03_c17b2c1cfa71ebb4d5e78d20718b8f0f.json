    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP):The Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) on Thursday finalized comprehensive arrangements to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply during Muharram, with a particular focus on Ashura Day. According to IESCO Chief Executive Muhammad Naeem Jan, special operational measures have been taken across the region to maintain reliable service during religious gatherings and processions. Field teams are actively coordinating with district administrations and organizers of mourning processions to respond promptly to any electricity-related issues. In anticipation of feeder faults or tripping incidents, complete patrolling of 11 kV feeders has been carried out to detect and address vulnerabilities in advance. As part of the preparations, all power lines along procession routes have been reorganized, and relevant transformers have been upgraded to ensure load stability. IESCO has also dispatched additional transformers, meters, electricity poles, and other essential materials to field offices for rapid deployment if needed. He said to strengthen field response capacity, transformer trolleys have been positioned at SDO offices, and all leaves for officers and staff have been suspended to ensure full availability of personnel during Muharram. Chief Engineer Zaid Usmani, appointed as the focal person for field operations, has been supervising activities on the ground to ensure real-time readiness. The IESCO helpline 118 and all complaint centers have been placed on high alert, with extended support teams available to register and resolve issues swiftly.",
