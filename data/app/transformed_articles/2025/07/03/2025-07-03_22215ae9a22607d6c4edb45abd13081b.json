    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP):In a major stride towards honoring the country's cultural icons, a high-level meeting of the Sub-Committee on Arts and Literature for the Pakistan Civil Awards 2025 was held on Thursday at the Cabinet Division. The session was chaired by Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Muhammad Aurangzeb Khichi. The committee reviewed 129 nominations submitted by various institutions, focusing on individuals who have made exceptional contributions in the fields of arts and literature. Stressing the need for merit and transparency, the participants unanimously agreed that the selection process must remain impartial and reflective of Pakistan's rich and diverse cultural heritage. The meeting was attended by officials from the Cabinet Secretariat, National Heritage and Culture Division, Inter-Provincial Coordination Division and representatives from literary and artistic circles. Federal Secretary for National Heritage and Culture, Asad Rehman Gilani, and IPC Secretary Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani also participated. Aurangzeb Khichi emphasized that the selection should be based on meaningful consultation with subject experts, rather than any formal examination or grading criteria. The committee also noted with concern the absence of nominations from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arts and Culture Department. The Minister assured that if the province submits appropriate names, they will be considered on merit. A comprehensive evaluation of nominees, their achievements, and the relevant award categories was conducted during the meeting. Aurangzeb Khichi further recommended that there should be no fixed limit on the number of awardees, ensuring that all deserving individuals receive recognition. The committee's recommendations will now be forwarded for final approval under the Pakistan Civil Awards 2025.",
