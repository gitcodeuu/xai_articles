    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP):Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Muhammad Aurangzeb Khichi Thursday said that meaningful cultural reforms are essential to revive Pakistan's heritage and connect the younger generation to its roots. He made these remarks while reviewing ongoing development projects at Lok Virsa during a briefing by Executive Director Dr. Waqas. The meeting focused on initiatives aimed at enhancing tourist engagement through cultural visuals, skill-building programs, and institutional revival. Dr. Waqas briefed the minister that arts and crafts classes have already commenced at Lok Virsa, while dance and music sessions are scheduled to begin soon. Emphasizing the importance of hygiene and visitor experience, Aurangzeb Khichi directed that special attention be paid to the cleanliness of washrooms and food areas. \"Cleanliness is half of faith,\" he stated, adding that better hygiene standards would improve tourist satisfaction and reflect positively on the institution. To promote cultural awareness among youth, the minister proposed organizing nationwide competitions in music, visual arts, handicrafts, and truck art for children under 20, with awards for the winners. He also announced that singing competitions will soon be held at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) to spotlight emerging talent. \"These steps will not only promote the institution but also help revive dying cultural traditions,\" said Aurangzeb Khichi, underlining the importance of engaging youth in cultural preservation. The meeting also reviewed preparations for cultural programs in connection with Pakistan's Independence Day on August 14. Looking ahead to the upcoming Lok Mela, Khichi announced that foreign companies would be invited to set up stalls, encouraging international cultural exchange. Formal invitations will be extended to ambassadors of various countries to ensure diplomatic participation. These initiatives, he noted, are part of a broader national effort to preserve and promote Pakistan's rich cultural heritage at both domestic and international levels.",
