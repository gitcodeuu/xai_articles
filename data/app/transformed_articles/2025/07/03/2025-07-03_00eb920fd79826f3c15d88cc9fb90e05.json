    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP): Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Federal Minister Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Thursday visited the Islamabad's G-6 sector to inspect the arrangements for Muharram gatherings and processions. On the occasion, Chief Commissioner, Inspector General of Police Islamabad, and organizers of the Imambargah were also present during the visit. The ministers visited the central Imambargah Isna Ashari and reviewed the preparations for the religious events. They were briefed by the administration on the overall setup, including security measures, procession routes, and parking arrangements. According to the briefing, the Safe City Control Room is actively monitoring all Muharram-related processions and majalis across the capital through surveillance systems. Officials informed the visiting ministers that a total of 181 processions and 965 majalis will take place during the holy month throughout Islamabad. To manage security, over 16,000 personnel from the police and Rangers will be deployed across the city. These officers will be assigned to maintain order, ensure safety, and provide support in managing crowds at all designated sites. The ministers were informed that the district administration is in regular contact with the organizers of all registered Imambargahs in the capital. Coordination meetings have also been held with scholars and leaders of various sects to maintain harmony and cooperation throughout the religious period. Both ministers expressed satisfaction with the current preparations and emphasized the importance of keeping all security arrangements intact throughout the month. They directed the concerned departments to ensure that no gaps remain in the security system. The ministers also highlighted the need to keep major routes and alternative roads clear for commuters during processions. They stressed that people traveling to and from other cities should not face inconvenience due to traffic diversions in place for religious gatherings. Officials were instructed to inform the public well in advance about road closures and alternative routes through appropriate channels, so that disruptions can be minimized. The visit reflects the federal government's focus on maintaining peace and ensuring that Muharram events proceed in a safe and orderly manner. Authorities said all departments are working together to ensure coordination between law enforcement agencies, religious leaders, and community organizers. Security checkpoints, walk-through gates, and surveillance cameras have been installed at key locations, and routes of major processions have been secured with additional deployment of law enforcement officials. Parking zones and access control points have also been identified in advance to manage traffic and crowds more effectively. During the briefing, it was also noted that emergency services will remain on alert throughout Muharram. Rescue teams, ambulances, and medical staff will be stationed near major venues to respond promptly to any incident. Both federal ministers urged the administration to maintain strict security protocols and continue coordination with all stakeholders involved in organizing the events. They reiterated that full support would be provided by the interior ministry to ensure peace and safety across the capital during the month of Muharram.",
