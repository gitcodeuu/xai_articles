    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP): Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) has devised a comprehensive traffic management plan to facilitate commuters during the 7th Muharram procession. A spokesperson told APP that the ITP the mourning procession will start from House No. 818 and pass through CDA Chowk and Double Road, culminating at Street No. 88, Imam Bargah Moosa Kazim. He said that during the procession, CDA Chowk will remain closed for traffic, and motorists are advised to use the service road I-10/4 and Street No. 23 as alternate routes. He said traffic heading towards I-10 Markaz via Double Road will also face restrictions, and citizens can instead use Sohni Road and I.J. Principal Road to reach their destinations. He said citizens are urged to follow the alternative routes during the mourning procession and avoid unnecessary movement in the area. He said the general public must refrain from illegal parking around the procession route and should park their vehicles only in designated parking areas. He said citizens are requested to fully cooperate with the traffic police to ensure the smooth flow of traffic and the peaceful conduct of the religious procession.",
