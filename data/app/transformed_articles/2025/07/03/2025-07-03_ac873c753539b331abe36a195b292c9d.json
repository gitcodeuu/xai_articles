    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP): Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday held an important meeting with leading religious scholars from across the country to discuss measures for maintaining peace, law and order, and interfaith harmony during the holy month of Muharram-ul-Haram, especially on Ashura. The meeting, chaired by Chairman of the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, brought together respected scholars from all schools of thought. Senior officials from the Ministry of Interior, FIA, Islamabad Police, and other law enforcement agencies were also present. During the meeting, Mohsin Naqvi praised the significant role that religious scholars play in preserving peace and stability during sensitive times. He said that their efforts are as crucial as those of the security forces and that scholars remain in constant contact with the administration, helping to resolve issues before they escalate. He added that he had personally witnessed many sensitive matters being resolved peacefully through the wisdom and efforts of religious scholars. The Interior Minister stressed the importance of mutual respect among different sects, stating, \"We should neither abandon our own sect nor attack others.\" He called this a golden principle that should be spread throughout the country to promote unity. He also emphasized that Imam Hussain (A.S.) is a revered figure for all Muslims and that every believer shares an equal spiritual connection with him. Mohsin Naqvi announced that on August 14, Pakistan's Independence Day, all religious scholars would be invited to join a special congregational Zuhr prayer at Faisal Mosque. He said this would send a powerful message to the world that Pakistan's religious communities stand united. Both he and Minister Talal Chaudhry pledged to personally deliver invitations to the scholars. The Interior Minister also voiced concern over the rising wave of terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He expressed a desire to visit the province and meet with local scholars to involve them in efforts to eliminate extremism and restore peace. He proposed holding the next such meeting in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and emphasized that religious scholars there have a vital role to play in countering terrorism. Minister of State Talal Chaudhry thanked the scholars for their consistent support and acknowledged their critical role in promoting religious harmony. He said that during Muharram and in the fight against terrorism, their responsibilities increase significantly. He stressed the need to stay united and not fall victim to any hatred or conspiracies.
