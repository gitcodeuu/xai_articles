    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP): Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi Thursday emphasized direct interaction with passengers and addressing their issues promptly. While presided over a meeting to review the performance of railway dry ports, he directed the railway officers to conduct frequent visits to stations. The meeting included a detailed analysis of revenue generation and operational capacity of Mughalpura, Islamabad and Azakhel dry ports. The possibility of outsourcing all railway dry ports was thoroughly discussed. \"These dry ports have immense revenue-generating potential,\" he added. The minister directed all Divisional Superintendents (DSs) to work diligently and focus on reforms. He said the installation of gas cylinders on all railway stations and trains must be approved by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA). Hanif Abbasi announced a new inspection campaign to ensure that only OGRA approved cylinders are used. He declared performance-based rewards for Station Masters, particularly in the areas of cleanliness, beautification, horticulture and maintenance. \"Any Station Master who performs exceptionally will be personally rewarded by me,\" Hanif Abbasi said.",
