    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, July 03 (APP): Federal Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf on Thursday held a meeting with Religious Counselor at the Embassy of the Republic of Turkiye in Pakistan, Dr. Abdul Rahman Akkus to discuss enhanced bilateral cooperation in the fields of religious education, welfare initiatives, and interfaith collaboration. During the meeting, both sides expressed satisfaction over the deep-rooted fraternal ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, grounded in shared religious and cultural values. Minister Yousaf highlighted the mutual commitment of both governments to further strengthen relations across political, economic, religious, and cultural spheres. \"Pakistan and Turkiye share a historic bond of Islamic brotherhood,\" said Sardar Yousaf. \"We deeply value Turkiye's unwavering stance on issues concerning the Muslim Ummah, including its vocal support for the oppressed people of Kashmir and Palestine, and its efforts against Islamophobia.\" He also lauded the Turkish government's decision to appoint a Hafiz-e-Quran and religious scholar like Dr. Akkus as Religious Counselor in Pakistan, terming it a commendable step toward expanding religious collaboration. The minister expressed appreciation for the Turkish Diyanet Foundation's ongoing welfare work in Pakistan, including Ramadan relief packages, Qurbani meat distribution, healthcare services, educational support, and provision of clean drinking water. Recalling the devastating 2005 earthquake, Minister Yousaf acknowledged Turkiye's vital role in post-disaster relief and reconstruction efforts. \"As former District Nazim of Mansehra during the earthquake, I witnessed Turkiye's heartfelt and generous support firsthand,\" he noted. He also proposed greater coordination among Islamic countries on the matter of a unified moon-sighting system, suggesting that the two nations could consult on this longstanding issue. Dr. Abdul Rahman Akkus expressed his country's desire to further expand cooperation with Pakistan in religious education, healthcare, and social welfare. He shared that the Diyanet Foundation is actively working to support underprivileged communities, distributing 1,000 school bags to orphan children, offering 100 higher education scholarships, and disseminating Seerat publications. He added that the foundation is also facilitating the distribution of qurbani meat, Ramadan food packages, and establishing water wells in remote areas. Dr. Akkus further announced that Turkiye's Fatwa Commission will soon visit Pakistan to engage with local religious scholars and enhance mutual understanding. Commending Sardar Yousaf's commitment to the Muslim Ummah, Dr. Akkus stated, \"His concern and dedication to the collective future of the Islamic world is truly admirable and worthy of emulation.\"",
