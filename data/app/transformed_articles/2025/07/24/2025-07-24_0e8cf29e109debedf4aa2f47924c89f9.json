    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):The lower court of Islamabad on Thursday turned down a request to let the Advocate General record a statement on behalf of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister (CM) Ali Amin Gandapur in a case related to alleged liquor and illegal weapons recovery. The court upheld the arrest warrants and directed Gandapur to record his statement in person or via video link at the next hearing. Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti rejected the plea submitted by the Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to record the statement under Section 342 on behalf of CM Ali Amin Gandapur, who is an accused in an ongoing case involving the alleged recovery of liquor and illegal arms. During Thursday's hearing, Gandapur's lawyer, Raja Zahoorul Hassan Advocate, informed the court that the Advocate General of KP would represent the chief minister in court. The judge initially paused the hearing to allow both representatives to appear. When the proceedings resumed, KP Advocate General Shah Faisal and Raja Zahoorul Hassan appeared before the court and filed an application seeking Gandapur's exemption from appearance. The Advocate General explained that a grand jirga was being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with tribal elders from across the country attending, and requested the court to delay the case hearing until September. Judge Chishti, while turning down the request, said that the detailed order would clarify the court's position. The court then adjourned the hearing and maintained the previously issued arrest warrants for Gandapur. The court also rejected the Advocate General's request to record Gandapur's statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code on his behalf. Instead, the court directed Gandapur to either appear in person or record his statement via video link in the next hearing. The court warned that failure to submit the statement could result in the forfeiture of the defendant's right to present their version of events. The hearing was adjourned until July 29.",
