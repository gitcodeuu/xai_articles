    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):The Islamabad district administration has intensified its action against retailers selling sugar above official rates and several shopkeepers were arrested, fined, and their shops sealed in different parts of the city, including Khanna Pul and G-7. According to the spokesman of ICT administration, price control magistrates carried out a targeted crackdown against vendors overcharging for sugar. The operation, held in multiple sectors of the capital, aimed to enforce the government-notified rates of essential commodities, especially sugar. During the operation, violations were reported from areas such as Khanna Pul, G-7, G-9, Bhara Kahu, and I-10. The magistrates took immediate action, arresting several individuals on the spot and imposing heavy fines on those found selling sugar at inflated prices. Shops found repeatedly violating price regulations were sealed on-site. According to officials, the crackdown was launched in response to complaints from residents about overpriced sugar being sold in markets despite clear government rate notifications. The Deputy Commissioner has appealed to the public to report any cases of overcharging directly to the administration through helplines or official social media accounts. He emphasized that timely information from citizens could help the authorities act swiftly and ensure fair pricing across the city. Price control magistrates have also been instructed to visit markets regularly and take action without delay upon receiving any complaint. They were told to ensure that traders display the official rate list at their shops and follow the pricing guidelines strictly. In recent weeks, complaints regarding increased sugar prices have been rising, prompting the authorities to take strict action. Shopkeepers and wholesalers have been warned of legal consequences if they are found violating the price control laws again. The district administration said that sugar, being a widely used item, must be sold at official rates, and any attempt to make undue profit at the expense of citizens will be dealt with firmly.",
