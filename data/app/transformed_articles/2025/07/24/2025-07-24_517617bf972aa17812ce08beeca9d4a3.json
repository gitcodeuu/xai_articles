    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):The body of a retired government official, who was swept away by floodwaters along with his daughter in a private housing society earlier this week, was recovered from the Soan River on Thursday, while the search for his missing daughter is still going on. A police spokesperson told APP that the incident occurred on Tuesday during heavy monsoon rain when the father and daughter were driving through a waterlogged street. Their vehicle stalled near a stormwater drain and was carried away by the powerful current. He said that rescue teams comprising police, Rescue 1122 personnel, and divers launched an immediate search operation. Parts of the vehicle, including its bumper and side mirror, were found downstream, which helped rescue workers identify the likely area of submersion. He said the father's body was recovered early Thursday morning from the Soan River. However, despite continuous efforts, the daughter has not yet been found, and rescue operations are still underway. He added that the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police and emergency services have been placed on high alert amid ongoing monsoon activity. Citizens are urged to stay away from flood-prone areas and immediately report emergencies through the Pucar-15 helpline",
