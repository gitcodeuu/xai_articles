    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):In a series of bold institutional reforms, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has taken significant steps to enhance operational efficiency, improve public service delivery, and intensify its crackdown on human trafficking networks. The agency, under the leadership of Director General Rafat Mukhtar Raja, has not only initiated a complete organizational restructuring but also unveiled a modern Command & Control Room within its Anti-Corruption Wing - a landmark move aimed at strengthening real-time coordination and response mechanisms. The newly established Command & Control Room is designed to handle all calls and public complaints directly, allowing the agency to respond promptly and effectively to reports of crimes and irregularities. Officials confirmed that FIA's helpline 1991 has now been officially integrated with the system, enabling a centralized and immediate response framework. \"The primary goal of these reforms is to offer citizens fast, transparent, and accountable services,\" an FIA spokesperson said. \"The Command & Control Room will significantly enhance the agency's performance and coordination capabilities.\" As part of its intensified campaign against human trafficking, FIA's Anti-Human Trafficking Circle in Taftan executed a major operation this week, resulting in the arrest of 33 foreign nationals attempting to cross the border illegally. According to officials, all detained individuals are Bangladeshi citizens who entered Pakistan on visit visas during June and July. The suspects were apprehended near the Mashkhel border in Chagai district, a known hotspot for illegal crossings. The operation was conducted in collaboration with the Frontier Corps (FC), underscoring the importance of inter-agency cooperation in curbing transnational crimes. FIA officials stated that when the detainees were asked to present legal travel documentation, they failed to produce satisfactory responses. Initial investigations suggest that the group was part of a coordinated effort to illegally migrate out of Pakistan. All suspects are currently in custody, and formal investigations have been launched. In a parallel development, the Special Judge Central Gujranwala delivered a significant verdict in a high-profile human trafficking case. The accused, Muhammad Kashif, was sentenced to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 1.4 million. The court awarded 10 years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 400,000 under the Immigration Ordinance, and an additional 10 years and Rs. 1 million fine under the Smuggling of Migrants Act. The convicted individual had reportedly taken Rs. 4 million from a citizen in exchange for illegally facilitating his travel to Spain. Tragically, the victim remains missing to date. FIA's Assistant Director Legal Asifahan Akram Kang represented the prosecution, while the investigation was led by Sub-Inspector Shiraz Ahmed. \"This verdict sends a strong message to traffickers and reflects FIA's unwavering commitment to eradicating human smuggling,\" the spokesperson said. The FIA reiterated its zero-tolerance policy toward human trafficking, smuggling, and related transnational crimes. Agency officials emphasized that the recent reforms - including the establishment of the Command & Control Room, improved coordination channels, and enhanced legal action - are designed to modernize the institution and ensure swift justice. The reforms come at a time when Pakistan is under increasing international pressure to combat human trafficking and improve border control mechanisms. Analysts believe that such institutional measures could also aid in restoring public confidence in law enforcement agencies and improve Pakistan's standing in global anti-trafficking rankings.",
