    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) successfully concluded its transformative initiative, STEM Camp 4.0, a week-long program, marked by vibrant scientific activities, hands-on experiments and an atmosphere of academic enthusiasm. The camp has been widely praised as a significant milestone in fostering scientific curiosity, creative thinking and practical skills among the youth. The closing ceremony featured Professor Syed Komal Taibi, President of the prestigious Eco Science Foundation, as the chief guest. The event was moderated by Dr. Tanveer Afzal, Head of AIOU's Science Department, said a press release on Thursday. In his keynote address, Professor Taibi described the modern era as one driven by research, observation and scientific consciousness. \"To enable our youth to meet global challenges with confidence, we must move beyond traditional education models and engage them in scientific experimentation, innovation, and experiential learning,\" he remarked. Reflecting on the camp's achievements, Dr. Tanveer Afzal shared that 130 students and 30 volunteers actively participated in the week-long program. \"The students not only conceptualized but also executed their own scientific projects,\" he noted. \"We merely offered them a foundational idea - from there, it was their journey of discovery, innovation, and self-driven learning. Through this process, we uncovered incredible talent and provided a platform for it to flourish,\" he said. Dr. Afzal also expressed his deep gratitude to the university leadership, especially Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood. \"This success would not have been possible without the unwavering support, vision, and commitment of our Vice Chancellor to creating a progressive and dynamic educational environment,\" he said. A major highlight of the event was the engaging \"Fun Science Show\" by Abdul Rauf from the Pakistan Science Club, Karachi, which captivated participants with live, interactive scientific demonstrations. The ceremony concluded with the distribution of certificates to all participants, celebrating their achievements and participation. STEM Camp 4.0 stands as a key initiative under the Vice Chancellor's broader educational vision to equip the next generation with not only knowledge but also the confidence and creativity to become future innovators and leaders in science and technology.",
