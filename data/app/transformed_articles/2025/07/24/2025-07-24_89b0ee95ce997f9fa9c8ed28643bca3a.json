During a high-level meeting with a delegation from Arizona State University (ASU) led by Doug Becker, Founder and Chairman of Cintana Education held at the Prime Minister's Office, PM Shehbaz highlighted that aligning Pakistan's education system with international standards was a top government priority. The prime minister emphasized the need to modernize education and equip the country's youth with professional and technical skills essential for competing in global markets. \"All government education policies are centered around creating employment opportunities for youth based on their professional capabilities,\" the Prime Minister stated. He praised the collaboration with Arizona State University as a transformative step, particularly the establishment of the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in Pakistan. \"This partnership is a significant milestone. The NIT will serve as a world-class institution that trains Pakistani youth to compete globally,\" he said. The prime minister noted that the government has undertaken key reforms in the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) over the past year, making it a more efficient and effective institution. He directed that NAVTTC should now work closely with ASU to bring innovation to the vocational training sector. Discussions during the meeting focused on the operationalization of the NIT, set to commence this year. Doug Becker assured full support from ASU in providing resources and facilities to advance innovation in Pakistan's education system. At the conclusion of the meeting, PM Shehbaz Sharif unveiled a commemorative plaque marking the operational launch of the National Institute of Technology.
