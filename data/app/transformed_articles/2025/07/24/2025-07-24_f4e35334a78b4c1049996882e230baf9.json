    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Chairman Senate Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani met with a 90-member delegation of the Tribal Jirga led by Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi at the Parliament House on Thursday. The Jirga included prominent tribal elders and guests including Dr. Alamzeb Mohmand, Malik Khan Marjan Wazir, and Bismillah Khan Afridi. During the meeting, the delegation informed the Chairman on challenges faced by the merged districts of the former FATA, including unjust distribution of resources and other critical issues. Chairman Senate warmly welcomed the delegation and assured them that the tribal people would not be left alone. He stated that the Senate is the strong voice and protector of the rights of the merged districts, and addressing their deprivations is among the national priorities. He thanked the Governor KP for effectively raising the issues of tribal people and said their concerns and demands are legitimate and must be addressed as a priority. The time has come to reward their sacrifices with development, employment, education, healthcare, and lasting peace. Chairman Senate said peace is a global concern, especially in the Islamic world where conflicts are being created. From Palestine and Gaza to Kashmir, many parts of the world are facing turmoil. He emphasized the collective need to work for global peace, mentioning his recent visit to Venice, Italy in this regard. Recalling history, he said that when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, around 3.5 million Afghans took refuge in Pakistan. Pakistan not only hosted them but also provided opportunities for employment, education, and family life. He lamented that the world has forgotten the sacrifices Pakistan made. He also recalled the resettlement of 2.5 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Swat, Malakand, and South Waziristan within 90 days during his tenure as Prime Minister a first in history. He shared that he personally visited affected regions and joined people for iftar during holy month of Ramazan at IDPS campus. Despite security challenges, he remained committed to their welfare. He recalled honoring Malala Yousafzai with a Peace Award from his office before the world recognized her with the Nobel Peace Prize three years later. He highlighted that his own son was abducted by miscreantas elements and released after a military operation lasting three years. He emphasized that peace is not just about the absence of conflict, but about justice. The tribal leadersa concerns, previously shared with him by the Governor deserve resolution. The Chairman stressed that cooperation from tribal elders is vital to achieving lasting peace. He reminded participants of his familyas active role in the Pakistan Movement and their collaboration with Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Without the support of the tribal people, the creation of Pakistan would not have been possible. He paid tribute to the sacrifices made by the tribal communities and noted the contributions of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto in promoting peace. He said poverty, illiteracy, and ignorance breed terrorism and insecurity, and the world desperately needs peace. He urged better use of the natural resources in the merged districts, formerly part of FATA. He noted that FATA and surrounding areas once cultivated large quantities of poppy and through dialogue and strategy (such as the Kerry-Lugar Bill), alternative means of livelihood were introduced. He also highlighted the need to address issues in South Punjab, demanding a comprehensive resolution from the government for both tribal and other underprivileged areas. He reiterated that the Senate will serve as a strong voice for the people. He also reminded the audience that he initiated the NFC Award and that after the 18th Constitutional Amendment, provinces now have more authority and must play a more active role in resolving these issues. Chairman Gilani affirmed that both as Prime Minister and now as Senate Chairman, he has worked under the same inclusive vision a vision championed by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, and later by President Asif Ali Zardari through the 18th Amendment. He announced that the issue of the merged districts will be discussed in the Senate to formulate a clear and comprehensive national policy. He emphasized that integration of these regions must be not only administrative but also economic and political. During the session, tribal leaders Malik Khan Marjan Wazir, Bismillah Khan Afridi, and Dr. Alamzeb Mehmund reiterated the historical role of tribal people in Pakistanas formation. However, they said that despite lapse of 77 years, these regions remain neglected. They pointed out that the Sartaj Aziz-led committee proposed reforms for these areas, but the problems of 5 million IDPs remain unresolved. They acknowledged the work of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the region and expressed hope that Chairman Gilani will carry forward his mission. They claimed the FATA merger happened without public consultation and demanded restoration of the Jirga system. They also criticized unfulfilled promises of financial support under the NFC Award, stating that even the committed Rs. 100 billion were never delivered, and the promised Rs. 26 billion in annual ADP was also not honored. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, highlighted the commitments made by the Sartaj Aziz Committee to allocate 3% of the NFC Award to the merged districts of FATA under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). He said that this commitment has not been fully implemented and the federal government has often allocated amounts lower than originally pledged. Furthermore he pointed out that the allocated funds do not directly reach the uplift program but are in instead integrated into the provincial system, raising concerns about transparency and effective utilization. He further emphasized that following the merger of FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the geographical size of the province has increased. According to the indicators of the 7th NFC Award, the share of the population attributable to the merged areas has also grown from 13% to 17.1% of Pakistanas total population while poverty indicators in the region have worsened. Despite these demographic and economic developments, the people of former FATA region have yet to receive their rightful constitutional share of NFC resources, which has hindered development efforts and affected livelihood in the area. Governor Kundi called upon the federal government to ensure that the people of ex FATA receive their due and constitutionally mandated share under NFC framework.",
