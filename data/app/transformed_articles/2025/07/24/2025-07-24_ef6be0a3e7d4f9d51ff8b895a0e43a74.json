Presiding over a high-level security meeting at the Chief Minister's Secretariat, Bugti expressed grave concern over the surge in organized crime. He emphasized that local administrations bear the core responsibility for maintaining security on national highways and called for visible, merit-driven results. The meeting saw the participation of senior provincial officials including Revenue Minister Mir Asim Kurd Gello, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat, Principal Secretary Babar Khan, Additional IG Mohammad Yousaf, DIG CTD Aitzaz Ahmed Goraya, Additional Secretary Fareedon, and Spokesperson Shahid Rind, while officers from Sibi and Naseerabad Divisions joined via video link. CM Bugti gave law enforcement agencies including police and Levies a \"free hand\" to neutralize criminal elements, urging them to operate beyond jurisdictional lines when required. He called for a unified strategy between agencies and reaffirmed zero tolerance for any negligence or delay. Bugti emphasized collaboration with Frontier Corps (FC) and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) to execute integrated operations. He also ordered the establishment of joint highway check posts with robust monitoring systems, insisting that no political interference should hinder these efforts. \"Restoring peace and protecting citizens remain the provincial government's highest priority,\" he concluded.",
