    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):With slim chances of moon visibility due to monsoon clouds and astronomical conditions, the beginning of Safar 1447 AH is expected to fall on Sunday, July 27, 2025, according to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). While the new moon is expected to be born in the early hours of July 25, experts say visibility conditions are not favorable for it to be seen that evening. SUPARCO has reported that the new moon will be born on July 25 at 12:11 AM PST. By the time of sunset on the same day, the moon's age will be approximately 19 hours and 31 minutes, which generally meets the threshold for potential visibility. However, the duration between sunset and moonset is expected to be just 43 minutes along the country's coastal regions, making the likelihood of sighting the crescent very low. The situation is further complicated by prevailing monsoon conditions, which are likely to obstruct visibility across several regions of Pakistan. Cloud cover and atmospheric disturbance can significantly hamper any effort to observe the thin crescent with the naked eye or telescopic equipment. Given these scientific and environmental indicators, SUPARCO has concluded that the chances of sighting the Safar moon on the evening of July 25 are minimal. Accordingly, the 1st of Safar is expected to fall on July 27, subject to official confirmation. The final decision regarding the commencement of the Islamic month will be made by the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, which is the sole authoritative body in Pakistan for moon sighting announcements. The committee will meet on the evening of July 25 to assess moon sighting reports from across the country and make a formal declaration. SUPARCO emphasized that while astronomical data provides a scientific basis, religious confirmation remains a necessary step in accordance with national practice and Islamic tradition.",
