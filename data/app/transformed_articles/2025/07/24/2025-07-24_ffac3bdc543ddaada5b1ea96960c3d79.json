He was speaking to a delegation of tribal elders of the merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa led by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) President Maulana Fazlur Rehman who visited the Prime Minister's House. The jirga discussed in detail the improvement of public order in the merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the construction and development of these areas.
