    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC)'s division bench on Thursday suspended the decision of single member bench for formation of a commission to probe the allegations of blasphemy. A two-judge bench comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Azam Khan heard the case in which lawyer Kamran Murtaza and others appeared before the court on behalf of Rao Abdul Rahim. During hearing, Justice Soomro inquired from the petitioners that how they are affected by this decision. To which the lawyer said that we have not been given the full right to a hearing. There are 400 cases and some cases are outside the jurisdiction of this court, he said. The lawyer said that the authority to form the commission lies with the federal government. This case was disposed of in the court, then a written decision came which stated that the case will remain pending. Can a writ petition be heard by anyone else, he argued. Justice Azam Khan asked whether the case can be kept pending after the final order, to which the lawyer said that it cannot be continued. The court reserved the decision after the initial hearing as the appeal was admissible. Later, the court pronounced the reserved decision and suspended Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan's decision to set up a commission on blasphemy allegations and stopped the implementation on the decision.",
