    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry Thursday clarified that the Frontier Constabulary has been restructured and revamped to strengthen its operational effectiveness bringing it on par with other law enforcement agencies in terms of functionality and institutional standing. Responding to a Calling Attention Notice moved by Senators Syed Ali Zafar, Aimal Wali Khan, Jan Muhammad, Abdul Shakoor Khan, and Dost Muhammad Khan, the Minister stated that the Frontier Constabulary's services and utility have been formally recognized through a newly issued ordinance bringing it on par with other law enforcement agencies in terms of status and functionality. Responding to the Calling Attention Notice, the minister said the Frontier Constabulary (FC) has made immense sacrifices in the war against terrorism, with 450 personnel martyred in the line of duty.He noted that the force had been unfairly downgraded compared to other agencies, with meager salaries and limited institutional recognition. He highlighted the FC's diverse composition, stating it includes representation from 36 tribes, 96 sub-tribes, and comprises 512 platoons. He said personnel for the Frontier Constabulary would be recruited from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with a new Reserve Division of 3,900 recruits being established. He added that 24 percent of the division's representation would be allocated to the province./",
