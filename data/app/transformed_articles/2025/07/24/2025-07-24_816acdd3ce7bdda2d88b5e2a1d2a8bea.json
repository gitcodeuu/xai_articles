    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Foreign Office Spokesperson, Shafqat Ali Khan on Thursday said Pakistan's foreign policy remained anchored in peaceful diplomacy, regional stability, and multilateralism. The Foreign Office Spokesperson outlined a comprehensive overview of the country's recent diplomatic activities during his weekly press briefing, emphasizing Pakistan's strong commitment to multilateralism, peace, and international cooperation. Shafqat Khan detailed the high-level engagements of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar during his ongoing visit to the United States, which coincided with Pakistan's Presidency of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The Spokesperson noted that DPM/FM Dar chaired signature UNSC events in New York, including a high-level open debate \"Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes\". The event also saw the unanimous adoption of UNSC Resolution 2788 under Pakistan's presidency, urging greater reliance on diplomatic tools and inclusive diplomacy outlined in Chapter VI of the UN Charter, he said. He reiterated Pakistan's principled stance on global peace, highlighting the DPM/FM's powerful address at the General Debate of the UN High-Level Political Forum, in which he advocated for a just and inclusive international financial system to support sustainable development goals (SDGs) for developing countries. The Spokesperson underscored Pakistan's continued and unequivocal condemnation of Israeli aggression in Gaza and Syria. \"The systematic targeting of civilians and humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza is a flagrant violation of international law,\" he said, describing the humanitarian crisis there as an \"anthropogenic starvation.\" He reaffirmed Pakistan's call for an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the siege, and establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds-Al-Sharif as its capital. Regarding Syria, he condemned Israel's recent strikes, terming them \"dangerous escalatory actions\" that undermine regional peace. Responding to queries on Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi's recent visit to Kabul, the Spokesperson said security cooperation, including concerns over sanctuaries for TTP militants in Afghanistan, remained a central theme. \"Discussions are ongoing. The Afghan side is increasingly receptive to Pakistan's concerns,\" he added. He also confirmed progress on trilateral cooperation with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, especially in the context of the Uzbek-Afghan-Pak (UAP) Railway Project, reinforcing regional connectivity and economic integration. The Spokesperson further confirmed that the visit of Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is under discussion, while declining to speculate on the question of formal recognition of the Taliban-led interim government. He shared details of the DPM/FM's bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the UN visit with senior officials from Austria, the UK, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. He also confirmed the 10th EU-Pakistan Political Dialogue and the 7th Pakistan-UK Arms Control Dialogue, covering topics ranging from counter-terrorism to peaceful nuclear use. On the humanitarian front, Khan noted Pakistan had dispatched 26 aid consignments for Gaza and remains committed to sending more, despite Israeli-imposed obstructions. Responding to a question on the Iranian President's anticipated visit, Khan clarified, \"There was no finalized date for July 26. Discussions are ongoing and an announcement will be made when details are finalized.\" He also addressed reports of visas by some employees, stating that internal procedures are underway and relevant authorities are being consulted. On reports about passports for Rohingya refugees, Khan deferred details, promising to provide information after checking with the concerned ministries. Khan reiterated Pakistan's openness to dialogue with India. \"Diplomatic engagement is not a favor - it is in the mutual interest of both nations,\" he stated, once again thanking the US for its role in past de-escalation efforts. Asked about President Trump's recent remarks about credit for defusing a near-nuclear crisis in South Asia, Khan said: \"We have repeatedly acknowledged the role of friendly nations, including the US. The facts of that crisis are well known.\" Regarding reports of the US-Pakistan dialogue including discussion on Jammu & Kashmir and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), the Spokesperson confirmed these issues remain central to Pakistan's diplomatic agenda and are expected to be raised in the DPM/FM's meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He concluded by affirming Islamabad's active pursuit of global engagement amid evolving geopolitical challenges.",
