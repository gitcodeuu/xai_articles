    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP): Capital Development Authority (CDA) will introduce electric tram buses in Islamabad, ensuring citizens have access to advanced transport solutions. It was decided in a meeting held under the chairmanship of CDA Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa on Thursday. Randhawa directed the completion of a feasibility study for the tram system to facilitate modern bus services on the busiest routes. The trams will feature multiple compartments to accommodate more passengers and will be designed to be accessible for differently-abled individuals and women. Detailed discussions were held regarding introducing a state-of-the-art transport system for the citizens of the Federal Capital. Chairman CDA said that providing modern and efficient transport facilities is CDA's top priority. During the briefing, it was informed that a feasibility report covering financial, operational and business models is being prepared. The electric bus project has already exceeded a daily ridership of 90,000 passengers, as these buses are eco-friendly, cost-effective and punctual, attracting appreciation from citizens. Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa instructed officers to finalize the feasibility report, particularly focusing on financial sustainability. He emphasized developing a self-sustaining financial model and exploring public-private partnerships. Clear timelines and operational goals for the tram project were also established. Regarding electric feeder buses, the Chairman CDA directed route selection based on passenger data, prioritizing high-traffic areas. He also ordered the installation of modern digital screens at terminals displaying advertisements, schedules and safety guidelines. To enhance revenue, smart ticketing systems and in-bus advertisements will be introduced. Additionally, electric buses will also be allocated for CDA employees. The meeting was informed that 140 bus stops are being upgraded, with over 200 new stops to be constructed, featuring digital boards for non-fare revenue generation. Chairman CDA and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa said that these initiatives will ensure a modern, efficient, and eco-friendly transport system. They expressed confidence that these projects will transform Islamabad into a cleaner, smarter, and more attractive capital, with citizens playing their part in supporting this vision.
