    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP): The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have taken a significant step towards promoting food security by initiating cooperation through the first-ever joint Green Legacy Forum. The forum, organized by the Ethiopian Embassy in Islamabad and the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, brought together agriculture experts, researchers, and students to exchange knowledge and best practices. Ethiopia's Ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Jemal Beker Abdula, highlighted the similarities between Ethiopia and Pakistan as agro-economies vulnerable to climate change. The Ambassador shared Ethiopia's success story of transforming into a food self-sufficient nation under Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed's leadership, citing the Green Legacy and Yelemat Tirufat (Bounty of Basket) initiatives. Ethiopia has planted over 40.5 billion seedlings, increasing forest cover from 17% to 23%, and achieved substantial increases in agricultural and livestock productivity. The Federal Secretary for National Food Security and Research, Amir Mohyuddin, proposed twinning the Green Legacy and Green Pakistan initiatives to facilitate knowledge sharing and joint research programs. The two countries have expressed keenness to further cooperate on food security, with Ethiopia willing to share its expertise and best practices with Pakistan. The joint initiative aims to promote green economic development, sustainable land and water management, and address climate change consequences. The Ambassador and the Federal Secretary inaugurated the Green Legacy Park at the National Agriculture Research Center (NARC), planting fruit tree seedlings to symbolize the growing friendship between Ethiopia and Pakistan. The Director General of NARC, Dr. Muhammad Azam Khan, emphasized the importance of joint international efforts to address climate change and its severe consequences.",
