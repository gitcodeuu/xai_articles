    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):A landmark contribution to the field of diplomacy, \"The Currency of Influence: Economic Diplomacy and Public Perception through Public Diplomacy\" authored by Ambassador Dr. Ahmed Ali Sirohey, was officially launched at the Secretariat of OIC-COMSTECH here on Thursday. Published by AISI Publications in 2024, the book offers a profound exploration of the evolving dynamics of public and economic diplomacy, blending theoretical insight with real-world experience-particularly drawn from Dr. Sirohey's tenure as Pakistan's Ambassador to Niger, said a press release. The launch ceremony was attended by an esteemed audience of diplomats, civil society leaders, academics, and COMSTECH officials, underscoring the relevance of diplomacy in shaping Pakistan's global image. Spanning 23 chapters, The Currency of Influence highlights the role of soft power, cultural understanding, patience, and public engagement as critical instruments in modern international relations. From diplomatic strategies to field case studies, the book is a rich resource for scholars, policymakers, and students of international affairs. The book included a foreword by former Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood, enhancing its academic value. Already, it has been described as a \"masterpiece of modern diplomatic thought\" in both academic and diplomatic circles. Prof. Dr M. Iqbal Choudhary, Coordinator General of COMSTECH, lauded Dr. Sirohey's contribution to diplomacy, praising his service in Africa and his efforts to elevate Pakistan's international presence. He emphasized the importance of intellectual contributions like this in projecting a positive national narrative. Currently serving as Director General at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Ahmed Ali Sirohey shared personal insights during the event and reflected on the importance of science diplomacy and knowledge-sharing among OIC member states, especially the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in Africa. He also expressed gratitude to COMSTECH for advancing policy-oriented platforms that encourage innovation and strategic dialogue in diplomacy. With The Currency of Influence, Dr. Ahmed Ali Sirohey provides a compelling blueprint for understanding how influence, narrative, and strategic engagement shape today's global diplomatic landscape. This work is a timely and essential read for practitioners and students alike.",
