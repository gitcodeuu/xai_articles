    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP):As Pakistan battled record-breaking heatwaves and relentless monsoon rains in 2025, the Sahiwal Coal-Fired Power Plant (CFPP), with its 1,320 MW generation capacity, emerged as a key pillar of national grid stability, ensuring uninterrupted electricity supply when it was needed the most. According to official sources from Sahiwal Coal-Fired Power Plant, as electricity demand surged due to unprecedented heatwaves and heavy rainfall events, the plant's strategic location, robust base-load capability, and technical integration into the national transmission network allowed it to play a vital role in supporting the Independent System & Market Operator (ISMO) in maintaining uninterrupted power delivery across major regions. During the peak summer months of May to July 2025, Pakistan experienced some of the highest recorded temperatures in recent years. This led to a dramatic spike in electricity consumption, particularly in major urban and agricultural areas within the Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Multan Electric Power Company Limited (MEPCO), and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) jurisdictions. Air conditioning, refrigeration, irrigation pumping, and industrial operations collectively strained the system, pushing daily peak demand to nearly 30,000 MW. This surge put immense stress on the grid, increasing the risk of power imbalances, voltage drops, and forced load-shedding. In this critical scenario, the Sahiwal plant operated as a reliable anchor for the power system, delivering consistent base-load generation and helping keep system frequency close to the ideal 50 Hz mark. When other sources such as hydropower and wind showed variability due to changing water inflows and wind speeds, Sahiwal's steady output provided much-needed balance. Beyond frequency stability, the plant also helped manage voltage levels, especially in central and southern Punjab. Prior to the commissioning of Sahiwal, voltage fluctuations and overloaded transformers caused frequent outages in these regions. However, in 2025, the reactive power support from Sahiwal's generators stabilized voltages across the 500 kV and 220 kV networks, particularly during hot afternoons when air-conditioning demand was at its peak. This helped prevent under-voltage issues and reduced stress on downstream transformers. The plant's contribution extended beyond generation. Its integration into the national grid through the Yousafwala 500 kV substation improved power flow to high-demand areas. In past years, transformer banks at Yousafwala were operating below their rated capacities. However, with the operational stability and load dispatch coordination established between Sahiwal and ISMO, these assets were now being utilized optimally. In fact, an additional 600 MVA transformer was added to Yousafwala to accommodate the consistent power being injected from the plant. This led to improved voltage regulation and reduced technical losses in transmission. Another key strength was the plant's connectivity through a bi-directional loop at Qadirabad on the 500 kV line linking Yousafwala to Lahore. This design gave ISMO the flexibility to reverse power flow based on shifting demand and supply conditions. During the summer evenings, when load patterns shifted and generation ramped up from hydel sources in the north, the reverse flow capability helped prevent transmission congestion and balanced the system dynamically. The flexibility offered by this arrangement became particularly important during emergency situations when ISMO had to make split-second decisions to reroute power and avoid cascading failures. As monsoon rains set in, the challenges shifted. Heavy downpours, lightning, and flooding disrupted hydropower generation in the north and damaged transmission lines. In several instances, cloud bursts and landslides damaged transmission lines or reduced water availability in key dams. Sahiwal filled this gap by ramping up production, keeping the power supply stable even during extreme weather events. Its real-time coordination with ISMO's National Power Control Center, supported by automated generation control systems and fast communication protocols, enabled it to respond swiftly to grid needs. Whether it was ramping up during a sudden voltage dip in southern Punjab or providing frequency support after a wind generation drop in Sindh, the plant's responsiveness greatly reduced ISMO's burden during system stress periods. A noticeable outcome of Sahiwal's performance in 2025 was the significant reduction in forced load-shedding across MEPCO, LESCO, and parts of GEPCO. Consumers in areas served via the Yousafwala transmission corridor reported fewer interruptions, more consistent voltage, and better service reliability compared to previous years. This improvement was not only a testament to the plant's technical performance but also a reflection of strategic planning and execution between Huaneng Shandong Ruyi and national grid operators. In a year marked by climate extremes and rising demand, the Sahiwal CFPP stood tall as a dependable backbone of the national grid. Through its consistent output, voltage and frequency support, transformer optimization, flexible power flow, and rapid response to emergencies, the plant played a decisive role in helping ISMO maintain national grid stability. Its contribution once again affirmed the importance of well-integrated, base-load thermal generation in complementing variable renewable sources and managing peak seasonal stress.",
