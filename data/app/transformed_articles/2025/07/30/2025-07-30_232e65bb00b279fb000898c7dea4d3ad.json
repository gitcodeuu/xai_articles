    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP): The Deputy Head of Mission at the Embassy of the Netherlands in Pakistan, Hajo Provo Kluit, met with Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, on Wednesday to discuss bilateral cooperation in urban development, sustainable infrastructure, and environmental initiatives. The meeting, held at CDA Headquarters, focused on enhancing collaboration in smart city planning, green technologies, and sustainable landscaping. Both sides expressed commitment to strengthening ties in areas such as waste management, climate-resilient horticulture, and eco-friendly urban planning. During the interaction, Hajo Provo Kluit praised the CDA's recent efforts in addressing urban challenges, especially the swift resolution of water drainage issues following the recent monsoon downpours. He also commended the CDA's ongoing projects, including the beautification of the city, the transformation of CDA's nursery into a \"Gardenia Hub,\" and the broader initiative to evolve Islamabad from a \"safe city\" into a \"smart city.\" \"The Netherlands is keen to share its expertise in smart urban planning and sustainable horticulture,\" said Kluit. He noted the Netherlands' global reputation in areas such as tulip cultivation, Dutch rose production, and innovative green infrastructure. Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa briefed the Dutch envoy on key initiatives, particularly the uplift of the Diplomatic Enclave. He emphasized that these projects are being undertaken under the direction of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, aiming to bring the zone up to international standards. \"We are committed to transforming Islamabad into one of the most beautiful and sustainable capitals in the world,\" Randhawa stated. The two sides agreed to explore joint ventures in horticulture, landscaping, and environmental conservation. CDA's push for indigenous plantation and climate-resilient green practices aligns with Dutch expertise in soil management and sustainable technologies. The meeting concluded with both parties agreeing to maintain dialogue and identify further opportunities for collaboration. Kluit assured full cooperation from the Dutch side and reiterated his country's interest in contributing to Islamabad's transformation into a modern, green urban center.",
