    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP): In connection with Youm-e-Istehsal, the Jammu and Kashmir Students and Youth Forum (JKSYF) has launched a powerful poster campaign across Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), condemning the illegal and unilateral abrogation of Article 370 by the Indian government on August 5, 2019. Posters appeared on walls, electric poles and public places in several towns and districts, bearing strong messages against India's actions that stripped the region of its special status and opened the door to demographic changes under military occupation, said a press release here Wednesday. The posters, issued by the JKSYF, described August 5 as a \"Day of Betrayal\" and \"Youm-e-Istehsal\" (Day of Exploitation), calling on the international community to take notice of India's violations of international law and United Nations resolutions. Messages on the posters reaffirmed the commitment of the Kashmiri youth to resist colonial repression and continue the struggle for the right to the self-determination.",
