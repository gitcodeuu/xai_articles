    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP):A week-long miniature painting workshop is currently underway at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), drawing vibrant participation from professionals across the spectrum including engineers, doctors, advocates, architects, and artists. Launched on July 28 as part of the 79th Independence Day celebrations, the workshop continues to blend tradition with contemporary engagement, offering a deep dive into the rich legacy of Pakistani miniature art. Under the guidance of acclaimed visual artist Ms. Farrah, Associate Professor at COMSATS University Islamabad and recipient of the 2024 President's Award for Pride of Performance, participants are exploring intricate traditional techniques such as Suffaid Qalam (monochrome) and Guchrang (multicolour) painting. A graduate of NCA Lahore, Ms. Farrah brings a wealth of experience, having exhibited in over 160 international shows, with her works featured in prestigious collections like the World Bank and PNCA's National Art Gallery. The workshop is not just a technical training but also a cultural experience-fostering appreciation for indigenous art forms and encouraging cross-disciplinary exchange. As the sessions progress toward their conclusion on August 7, the participants are preparing for a final exhibition of their works. Certificates of participation will also be awarded, marking a symbolic step in PNCA's ongoing mission to revive traditional art and cultivate a shared artistic identity across Pakistan's professional landscape.",
