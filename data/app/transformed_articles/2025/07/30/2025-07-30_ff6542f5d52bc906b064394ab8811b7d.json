    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP): The Excise Department of Islamabad on Wednesday conducted a citywide crackdown and imposed fine of over Rs 1.3 million to 113 vehicles. On the instructions of the Director General of Excise, the department launched a series of enforcement operations across five locations in the city, said the spokesman of Excise department. The focus was on recovering outstanding token taxes and taking action against vehicles with tinted windows and illegal number plates. During the operation, Excise teams issued challans to 113 vehicles. Officials also recovered over Rs 1.3 million in token tax dues on the spot. In addition to tax recovery, several vehicle owners were heavily fined for using black-tinted windows and number plates that did not match the approved format. The DG Excise, Irfan Memon, has directed officials to ensure token tax collection without any exceptions. He also made it clear that there would be no leniency in cases involving tinted windows or non-standard number plates. Speaking on the campaign, DG Excise urged citizens to avoid using unapproved number plates and to ensure their vehicle documents, including token tax payments, are up to date. He added that such violations not only breach traffic regulations but also affect enforcement systems. The operations are part of a wider effort to improve compliance and ensure transparency in vehicle documentation across the city. Further checks and recovery drives are expected to continue in the coming days.",
