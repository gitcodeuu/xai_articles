    "article_body": "QUETTA, Jul 30 (APP):Federal Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Protection Syed Imran Ahmed Shah and Federal Minister of State for Education and Professional Training Wajiha Qamar on Wednesday said that poverty alleviation and development of Balochistan are the top priority of federal government to bring it as per other province. They said that the development and prosperity of women would play an important role in economic strength, poverty is not just a lack of income, it is a result of deprivation, lack of opportunities and unequal access to resources, poverty eradication and inclusive development are not possible alone saying that only through coordinated efforts between the government, international partners, civil society and the private sector, we create a future where every Pakistani gets equal opportunities, Balochistan would develop when its women and youth are empowered. They expressed these views while addressing an event titled Women Leadership and Modernization in Agriculture here at Governor House.

Syed Imran Ahmed Shah said that this is my first visit to Balochistan, I make it clear that our hearts beat with Balochistan when I got the ministry, I promised that we would not feed fish but teach them to catch them, the second is to reduce poverty and Balochistan is the first priority in this regard. He said that it is clear how inclusive growth through social protection not only transforms people's lives but also directly targets the roots of poverty. At the Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Social Protection, we believe that poverty is not simply a lack of income but a result of deprivation, lack of opportunities and unequal access to resources, he said. In this regard, I would like to specifically highlight the efforts of the Pakistan Poverty. He said that Alleviation Fund, which is being implemented through the Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress Project, this six-year project is being implemented with the financial support of the European Union, managed by the International Trade Centre, in partnership with FAO and PPAF. He stated that the scope of the project extends to a total of 22 disadvantaged and needy areas of the country, including 12 districts of Sindh and 10 districts of Balochistan. The main objective of GRASS is to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth in rural Pakistan. Its specific goal is to create equal income and employment opportunities for women and men, and to increase the productivity and profitability of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which are associated with primary production, services and value addition sectors as far as real achievements are concerned, they are before us. The Minister said that 399 matching grants were given under GRASSP at a cost of about Rs. 1.52 billion, which directly benefited rural entrepreneurs. The project signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with 24 financial institutions while 13 financial institutions were supported to provide credit guarantee schemes. As a result, 22 financial institutions are now providing specialized financial facilities. Capacity building has been an integral part of our strategy. 1271 SMEs were trained in financial literacy and business planning to make their businesses sustainable and profitable, most importantly, 415 SMEs, about 48% of which are women-owned, were linked to financial institutions, promoting true financial inclusion and empowerment of rural women, he said. The Federal Minister has announced 200 scholarships for the students of Sardar Bahadur Khan Women University, and the provision of 100 wheelchairs and 100 sewing machines for Balochistan, each scholarship will cost one lakh per year. He said that the autonomy of the provinces is the message of Pakistan, we should come out of provincial bias because many forces are trying to divide us, we must give our children a peaceful and prosperous Pakistan. Federal Minister of State for Education and Professional Training Wajiha Qamar said that the whole world is seeing the face of Balochistan. Today is the day to celebrate the empowerment of the people of Balochistan, Pakistan would develop when Balochistan develops. Balochistan could be developed when the women and youth here are empowered, the Federal Ministry of Education also has a vocational training department. She said that in addition to NFC awards, they are providing capacity building to the children of Balochistan through scholarships etc. so that these children could prove their mettle all over the world, whenever the children of Balochistan have got the opportunity, they have brought glory to the country and the nation. She said that Balochistan would emerge as the food basket of the whole world along with Pakistan's food basket, we have the people's desire to move forward. Instead of working in isolation, we need to expand this opportunity and make it structured. The flight is not complete without Balochistan being included.",
