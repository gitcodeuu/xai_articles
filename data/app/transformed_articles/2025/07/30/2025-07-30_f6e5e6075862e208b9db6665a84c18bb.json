    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday warned that any violation of the agreed sugar prices will lead to severe action as no one would be allowed to exploit the public economically. The prime minister chaired a high-level meeting focused on sugar pricing and availability across the country. The meeting underscored the government's commitment to ensuring fair prices and protecting citizens from economic exploitation. During the session, the Prime Minister issued strict directives for the enforcement of the agreement reached between the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and the government. According to the agreement, the ex-mill price of sugar is set at Rs. 165 per kilogram, while the retail price must not exceed Rs. 173 per kilogram. The officials also briefed the PM on ongoing operations against those involved in creating an artificial shortage of sugar. The government reiterated its resolve to continue cracking down on hoarders and manipulators in the market. The Prime Minister emphasized that the administration would not tolerate any attempts to disrupt the supply or inflate the price of essential commodities, particularly sugar.",
