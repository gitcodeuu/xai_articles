In his address at commemoration ceremony of 98th founding day of People's Liberation Army of People's Republic of China as a Chief Guest, the CJCSC commended PLA's pivotal role under the visionary leadership of President Xi Jinping for China's remarkable development and rapid modernisation, which has transformed People's Republic of China into a key pillar of peace, stability and prosperity. The CJCSC highlighted the enduring and time-tested \"Iron-clad brotherhood\" between Pakistan and China, with shared resolve to broaden and deepen this unique relationship across all domains, said a press release issued by Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) here.
