    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):The District and Sessions Court of Islamabad on Tuesday approved the transfer of the alleged custodial death case of Nauman Khan to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) after the post-mortem report confirmed he was subjected to torture while in police custody. The case was heard in the court of Judicial Magistrate Shehzad Khan, where the investigating officer submitted a request to hand over the case to the FIA under the Torture and Custodial Death Act 2022. The officer argued that after the confirmation of torture in the post-mortem report, the police can no longer continue the investigation under the current law. The court accepted the request and directed that the case be transferred to the FIA within two days. To complete the transfer process, the court also extended the physical remand of the four suspects for another two days. Earlier, the four accused - Rana Saleem, Muhammad Asif, Zaheer Ahmed, and Muhammad Sajid - were produced before the court after the completion of their one-day physical remand. All were arrested by the federal police in connection with Nauman Khan's death in police custody. The suspects are facing charges of murder and other offences, with the case registered at Tarnol Police Station.",
