    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):On the occasion of World Youth Skills Day, the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) organized a vibrant and inspiring National Skill Competition at the NAVTTC Centre of Excellence here on Tuesday, showcasing the exceptional talents and technical prowess of Pakistani youth. The event brought together skilled youth from across the country. Competitors participated to demonstrate their capabilities in sectors like hospitality, mechanical, textile, construction, services and information technology, reflecting NAVTTC's commitment to aligning skills training with international standards and market demands, said a press release. The event was graced by Honorable chief guest Dr. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training, Sajid Khokhar, Chairman Punjab TEVTA, Farah Naz, Parliamentary Secretory and Mr. Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, Chairman of the Prime Minister's Youth Programme. Their presence underscored the government's strong focus on skill education, as both dignitaries emphasized the critical role of technical and vocational skills in driving national development. Dr. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui applauded the Executive Director of NAVTTC for his leadership and commended the initiative of bringing all stakeholders under one roof. He stated, \"Pakistan is the name of determination and passion.\" He reflected on the purpose of religion being the pursuit of knowledge and truth. \"Your competition is not with one another, but with the rest of the world,\" he said, urging that we must enhance our expertise further in the fields of technology and skills to compete on a global level. Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan said, \"I am grateful to the Federal Minister and appreciate that NAVTTC and its affiliated institutions are working tirelessly, day and night. Pakistan is currently in a phase where positive news is coming from all around the world. Our global image is improving, and many countries are now eager to collaborate with us. We have already proven our strength in the field of technology, and now it is time to prove our mastery in the economic domain. I also acknowledge the Prime Minister's strong focus on expanding and promoting vocational education across the country.\" Sajid Khokhar, underlined the significance of World Youth Skills Day, stating that dedicating just one day to skills is not enough. \"We should dedicate an entire year to skills development,\" he asserted. He praised NAVTTC's organization of the National Skills Competition, noting that it has initiated greater coordination and unity among stakeholders in the skills ecosystem. Farah Naz said, \"I thank the Honorable Minister and the Executive Director of NAVTTC for organizing the National Skills Competition on World Youth Skills Day. Celebrating this day is a major milestone - it represents the recognition and celebration of skills as a core pillar of youth empowerment and national development.\" The Executive Director of NAVTTC, Muhammad Aamir Jan, said, \"I thank the Federal Minister for his continued support and guidance, under which NAVTTC has demonstrated its capacity at an entirely new level. For the first time, we celebrated World Youth Skills Day as a full-scale event. Encouraged by the overwhelming response from the youth, we are now committed to making this celebration a regular part of our annual calendar.\" \"NAVTTC has also shifted from output-based courses to industry-led training programs. With strong collaboration from industries, we are now providing real-time, hands-on training to our youth, aligning their skills with the actual needs of the market.\" On this occasion, NAVTTC also launched its official theme song, designed to energize and motivate youth to actively engage in skill-based learning and technical training. The song serves as a powerful reminder of the opportunities that lie ahead for young people who choose to pursue high-demand, future-focused skills.
