    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Zonal Office Lahore, in close coordination with NCCIA Lahore, has successfully conducted a series of raids against illegal SIM activities in Multan, Kot Momin (Sargodha), and Hasilpur. A raid in Multan uncovered a grey setup operating with a large number of active SIMs from all operators. Although the equipment was seized, the primary suspect fled the scene. Analysis of the seized SIMs led to the identification of a Zong Franchise in Kot Momin, where the franchise owner and two accomplices were arrested. On-the-spot investigation revealed the involvement of an individual in Hasilpur supplying fingerprints for illegal SIM issuance and collecting activated SIMs. The main suspect, operating three Ufone franchises in Vehari, Hasilpur, and Multan, and previously a Jazz franchise in Lahore, was apprehended. Recoveries included 15,996 SIMs (12,636 Ufone, 1,370 Jazz, 1,100 Zong, 890 Telenor), 18 Zong BVS devices, one 128-port gateway, six 64-port gateways, and four 32-port gateways.An FIR has been registered by NCCIA. This enforcement drive underscores PTA's unwavering commitment to curbing illegal SIM activities and safeguarding Pakistan's digital ecosystem. Citizens are encouraged to report such violations via call PTA at 0800-55055 or visit: https://complaint.pta.gov.pk/userlogin.aspx.",
