    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Senator Musadik Masood Malik, on Tuesday said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has lost popularity and mass acceptance. Speaking to a private news channel, he said that PTI has grown weak in terms of public appeal, as the people of Pakistan have recognized their true face. He criticized the party's leaders for using abusive and disrespectful language, stating that their behavior is contrary to democratic norms and cultural values. Their conduct is inappropriate not only toward political opponents but even toward their own members, he added. He further said that PTI used derogatory language against state institutions, the media, and opposition parties. He urged the leadership to adopt a more responsible and respectful political discourse.",
