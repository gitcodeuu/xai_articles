    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP): The National Skills University (NSU) in Islamabad buzzed with excitement as it joined the global community in celebrating World Youth Skills Day 2025. This year marked a decade of worldwide dedication to empowering young people with essential skills for a brighter future, with the theme \"Youth Empowerment through AI and Digital Skills\" resonating deeply with NSU's mission to prepare students for the modern, tech-driven world, said a press release on Tuesday. The highlight of the day was a powerful and inspiring keynote address by the Minister of State for Education, Ms. Wajiha Qamar, who also participated in a celebratory walk, urging young people to embrace new technologies and lead the way in shaping tomorrow. Ms. Qamar began her address by acknowledging the profound shifts occurring in the global economy. \"Artificial intelligence is no longer a distant concept. It is shaping the way we live, work, and imagine our futures. Our challenge and our responsibility is to ensure that Pakistan's youth are not left watching from the sidelines,\" she declared. Her words resonated strongly with the assembled students, faculty, and dignitaries, many of whom are actively involved in the university's expanding digital skills and AI education initiatives. Speaking with both urgency and optimism, Ms. Qamar envisioned a future where AI access is not a privilege for a select few, but a right for every learner, regardless of gender, location, or socioeconomic background. She lauded the National Skills University Islamabad's efforts in making AI and digital tools accessible, especially to those often marginalized in the country's educational reforms. A particularly poignant moment came with her recognition of a female civil engineering technology student from NSU, who received a cash prize for her innovative work in skills education - a powerful symbol of inclusive, future-focused education in action. The Minister's tribute to the university's remarkable transformation was both personal and professional. She commended the visionary leadership of Founding Vice Chancellor Professor Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar, highlighting how a previously overlooked institutional site has been transformed into a model of excellence and ambition. \"Dr. Mukhtar has not only built classrooms and laboratories, he has created a culture where practical knowledge is valued, and where skills education is treated not as second-tier, but as a national priority,\" she stated. This served as a collective validation for an institution that has steadily expanded its reach through smart classrooms, hands-on training, and international partnerships. The day's spirit extended beyond mere ceremony, with several university staff members being recognized for their consistent contributions to advancing skills education in Pakistan. The atmosphere was one of celebration, yet also of thoughtful reflection - an understanding that preparing youth for a rapidly evolving world demands constant adaptation, sustained investment, and a steadfast commitment to ensuring no one is left behind. As the event concluded, Ms. Qamar returned to the day's central theme, reminding the audience that the rise of AI represents not just a technological revolution, but a human one. \"What we need today is not just intelligent machines, but wise societies. We must ensure that our young people are equipped with not only the tools of innovation but the ethics of responsibility,\" she affirmed.",
