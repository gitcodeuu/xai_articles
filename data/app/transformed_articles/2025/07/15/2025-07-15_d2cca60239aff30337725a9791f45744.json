    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP): The Pakistan Youth Development Dialogue 2025 marked an inspiring celebration of World Youth Skills Day, bringing together a powerful mix of policymakers, corporate executives, nonprofit leaders, and youth advocates. The core message of the conference centered on empowering young people through digital skills, inclusive education, and climate leadership to help shape a resilient and sustainable future for Pakistan, said a press release. The conference was organized by Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) on Tuesday at a local hotel. Federal Minister for Board of Investment, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, in his keynote address as the chief guest, emphasized the government's commitment to creating an enabling environment for youth to thrive as contributors to national growth. He said that youth are the most valuable asset of Pakistan, and investing in their skills and entrepreneurship is the only path toward sustainable economic development. \"Today's rapidly evolving global economy demands a workforce that is adaptable, tech-savvy, and innovative. We need to align our national policies with this reality and ensure that our young population is not left behind,\" he noted. Sheikh further highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships in building a strong foundation for youth empowerment. He appreciated initiatives like the Pakistan Youth Development Dialogue and the newly launched Pakistan Youth Development Network for offering a strategic platform where government, corporate, and civil society stakeholders can come together for collective action. Founder of the Pakistan Youth Development Network and Executive Director of Devcom-Pakistan, Munir Ahmed, in his address, underscored the urgent need for a unified and inclusive approach to youth development in Pakistan. He stated that while the youth make up over 60 percent of the country's population, they often remain disconnected from policy processes and development planning. \"We cannot afford to let this demographic dividend turn into a liability. The Pakistan Youth Development Network is a step toward creating a nationwide platform that links young people to skills development, policy engagement, and leadership opportunities,\" he said. Munir Ahmed also emphasized the importance of equipping youth with digital, entrepreneurial, and climate resilience skills to meet the challenges of the 21st century. He called on government institutions, the corporate sector, and development organizations to work collaboratively in empowering youth from all backgrounds, including marginalized and remote communities. \"We are not just celebrating World Youth Skills Day - we are launching a movement that aims to make skills, innovation, and inclusion the cornerstone of national development,\" he concluded.",
