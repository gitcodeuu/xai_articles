A special committee led by Member Finance and comprising the DG Resource, DG Building Control, DG Law, and others was also formed to ensure transparency. \"This is a historic achievement,\" said CDA Chairman Randhawa while addressing participants. \"The strong participation of investors shows the trust they place in CDA's policies. We have worked day and night to bring Islamabad to this point, and we are just getting started.\" Randhawa emphasized that all auction activities followed strict merit-based procedures, with a strong focus on public interest. \"Every rupee raised through this auction will go back into the city-for development, beautification, and better public services,\" he said. CDA has introduced several incentives to encourage greater investment. Buyers making lump-sum payments within one month will receive a 5% rebate, with an additional 5% rebate offered for payments made in US dollars.
