    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):Prime Minister's Coordinator for Information, Broadcasting on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, on Tuesday strongly criticized Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) over its decision to stage political activities on August 5, calling it a damage to the Kashmir cause and also a move that aligned with India's narrative. Addressing a press conference at the PTV Headquarters, Wali said, \"August 5 is a black day when, in 2019, India revoked the special status of Indian-occupied Kashmir and intensified its oppression of the Kashmiri people.\" \"Selecting this day for political activities is tantamount to inflaming the pain of Kashmiris,\" he added. He further alleged that PTI founder Imran Khan's decision to politicize this date was intended to amplify India's propaganda. \"This is not a political movement; it's a tactic of national betrayal. On this day, when the entire nation stands with Kashmir, they will show their support to the enemy,\" he stated. \"It's unfortunate that Imran Khan's statements seem more in line with New Delhi's narrative than Pakistan's,\" he added. Wali asserted that the party's politics were confined to the boundaries of Bani Gala, lacking any vision for public service. Citing the latest Gallup survey, he revealed that the province has the highest corruption levels in the country. \"Jobs are being sold in KP and public development funds are vanishing into corruption,\" he said. He further criticized the provincial administration for failing to deliver even basic infrastructure in 13 years. \"No new hospitals, schools, or basic health centers have been established. If sports grounds, youth centers, or educational institutions do exist, then where are they? Because the people surely can't see them,\" he remarked. Ikhtiar Wali commended the federal government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the Punjab administration led by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for their rapid progress in health, education, and infrastructure-especially transport projects-across Punjab. He contrasted this with the PTI's apparent lack of dedication to development initiatives. He also said that, like other prisoners, the PTI founder was treated according to rule and law. Wali emphasized that the nation will stand with Kashmir on August 5 rather than the party upholding the enemy's agenda.",
