    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 7 (APP): Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the National Defence University (NDU) on Monday, where he addressed graduating officers of the National Security and War Course. According to Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the COAS in his key-note speech, highlighted the evolving nature of modern warfare and underscored the importance of mental resilience, operational clarity, and institutional professionalism in confronting emerging security challenges. Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded NDU's role in fostering civil-military synergy and preparing future leadership to navigate hybrid, conventional, and sub-conventional threats. He stressed the need for enhanced coordination between civil and military institutions to ensure national preparedness. Regarding regional developments, the COAS pointed out India's failure to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor, describing post-conflict justifications as \"illogical\" and indicative of \"a lack of operational preparedness and strategic foresight.\" He categorically rejected Indian allegations of foreign support in Pakistan's successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos calling them \"baseless and irresponsible.\" These claims reflect India's chronic reluctance to acknowledge Pakistan's indigenous capabilities, developed through decades of strategic planning and institutional strength, he said. The Field Marshal stated that involving other countries, in what was purely a bilateral military conflict, had been a flawed political tactic by India. He said that India's baseless statements were a failed attempt to project a self-assumed role as a \"net security provider\" in the region - particularly at a time when regional countries were increasingly frustrated with India's aggressive posture and Hindutva-driven ideology. \"Contrary to India's self-serving and narrow-minded conduct, Pakistan has established enduring partnerships in the international community based on principled diplomacy, mutual respect, and peace, thereby proving itself as a net regional stabilizer,\" he added. Reiterating Pakistan's principled stance, the COAS said : Any misadventure, attempt to harm Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity, or any violation thereof will be met with an immediate and forceful response - without hesitation. The Field Marshal said that any attempt to target Pakistan's population centers, military bases, economic hubs, or ports will be met with a severe, deeply painful, and overwhelmingly forceful response - beyond imagination. He said :The responsibility for any escalation would lie with the \"strategically blind and arrogant aggressor\" that fails to comprehend the consequences of provoking a sovereign nuclear state.\" \"Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported weaponry, or political sloganeering,\" he emphasized. \"They are won through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength, and national resolve.\" Field Marshal Asim Munir expressed full confidence in the professionalism and combat readiness of Pakistan's Armed Forces. He urged the graduating officers to uphold the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation.",
