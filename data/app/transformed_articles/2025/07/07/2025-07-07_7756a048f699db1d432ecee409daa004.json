    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 07 (APP): Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam, stated that the merger of tribal districts was not being reversed and anyone who has objections could raise their concerns. Addressing a press conference here Monday, he said that the Prime Minister has formed a committee with sincere intentions. Engr Amir Muqam explained that during the Prime Minister's recent visit to Peshawar, a Jirga of tribal elders took place where their concerns were discussed. He said the committee included representatives from all relevant parties and has been tasked with improving the living conditions of the people in the merged districts. He confirmed that the committee's meeting decided to consult with both current and former parliamentarians on these matters. Engr Amir Muqam expressed regret over the opposition's decision to boycott the committee, emphasizing the importance of a unified approach for the development of these areas. He emphasized that approved laws could be improved and politicizing the matter of merged districts was regrettable. \"No new constitutional amendment is being introduced,\" he added. \"The ruling party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is fragmented, and currently, no contacts have been made with any political group - though in politics, anything is possible,\" he noted. Engineer Muqam emphasized that decisions would be made in accordance with the aspirations of the people of the merged districts. The committee, he said, would engage all stakeholders, including elected representatives, and would work through broad consultations to address tribal concerns and enhance governance in the region. Secretary of the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, Zafar Hasan was also present during the press conference.",
