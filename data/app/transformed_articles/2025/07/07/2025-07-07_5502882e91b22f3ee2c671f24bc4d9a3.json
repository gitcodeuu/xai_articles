    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 07 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA), Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, on Monday finalized monsoon preparedness plans and emphasized stronger coordination among CDA formations, the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), District Administration, and the Disaster Management Authority (DMA). The meeting held at CDA Headquarters, was attended by CDA Board Members, Directors General of various formations, and senior officers, including the Director DMA. The primary focus was to ensure a swift and coordinated response to potential urban flooding, drainage blockages, and other monsoon-related challenges in Islamabad. Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa announced that he would personally monitor joint field operations to ensure effective service delivery. \"All formations of CDA, MCI, and the district administration must remain on high alert and work in unison,\" Randhawa directed. \"There should be no disruption to traffic flow on city roads, and any waterlogging in low-lying areas must be dealt with immediately.\" He ordered the immediate cleaning of stormwater drains and removal of obstructions to facilitate smooth water drainage. \"We will not tolerate negligence in monsoon response. Officers must take timely and practical steps to address water accumulation and drainage issues,\" he said. Randhawa also instructed that focal persons from all formations be assigned clear roles to streamline communication and coordination between field teams. He urged teams to be present in the field around the clock during rains and to resolve any emerging issues without delay. Later, the CDA chairman visited several areas of the city to inspect the on-ground situation and praised the performance of CDA teams during recent rainfall. He emphasized that similar diligence should be maintained throughout the monsoon season.",
