    "article_body": "KARACHI, Jul 07 (APP):Federal Minister for Interior Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi attended the commissioning ceremony of two new RHIB (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats) inducted into the Pakistan Coast Guards (PCG) fleet at Karachi Port as the chief guest. Upon his arrival, the chief guest was warmly received by Director General Pakistan Coast Guards, Major General Jawad Riaz. The ceremony was attended by senior military and civil officials, members of the international community, and notable personalities from various walks of life. In his address, the Interior Minister lauded the professionalism and performance of the Pakistan Coast Guards, stating that it is the only force in the country that operates simultaneously on both land and sea. \"PCG is a highly commendable and vital force, known for its effective role in preventing smuggling, illegal immigration, and anti-trawling fishing activities,\" he said. He further highlighted PCG's impressive record, particularly in combating smuggling, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. He noted that the induction of the two new RHIB boats will significantly enhance the operational capabilities of the force and contribute to curbing illicit activities. Mohsin Naqvi also appreciated the PCG's practice of regularly destroying seized narcotics and contraband items. This year alone, large quantities of such items were incinerated in Gwadar, Uthal, and Karachi, including 10,862 kilograms of hashish, 80 kilograms of crystal meth, 1,758 kilograms of heroin, 117 kilograms of ice, 150 kilograms of cannabis, 2,888 bottles of liquor, and 2,402 tons of beer. The estimated value of these destroyed narcotics in the international market is around $329 million. The Minister emphasized that the destruction of smuggled goods and narcotics, as well as public awareness campaigns, are essential to protect society. \"The menace of smuggling and drug trafficking poses a grave threat not only to our nation but also to the global community. We must collectively ensure its elimination,\" he concluded.",
