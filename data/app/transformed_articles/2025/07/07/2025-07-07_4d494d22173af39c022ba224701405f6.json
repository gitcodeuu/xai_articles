    "article_body": "KARACHI, Jul 07 (APP): Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday assured the business community of Karachi that the government was actively working to resolve all their issues, including law and order, crimes, water shortages, smuggling, narcotics and encroachments on priority basis. Addressing a ceremony at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), the interior minister emphasized that the government was considering all proposals to address the concerns of traders. Upon his arrival at the KCCI, the minister was warmly welcomed by the Chamber's office bearers and leading members of the city's business community, who briefed him on the challenges they are facing. During his speech, Naqvi highlighted the government's efforts to improve the global ranking of the green passport, stating, \"We are proud of our green passport, and in the future, it will be a source of even greater pride.\" He also praised the performance of the Sindh Police and Karachi Police, noting that the law and order situation in the city has significantly improved compared to the past, with a noticeable reduction in crime. \"If Karachi is healthy, Pakistan will be healthy,\" he remarked. On the issue of water scarcity, the Interior Minister said that Karachi, being a large metropolitan city, faces challenges similar to other major urban centers. He cited Islamabad as an example, where only 33% of the population currently receives water supply, and called for collective efforts to find a sustainable solution. Regarding smuggling, Naqvi said that the government has made considerable progress in curbing illegal trade. \"A few years ago, even dollars were being smuggled from here, but the situation has improved, and further measures are underway,\" he said. However, he clarified that while smuggling has not been completely eradicated, it has been significantly reduced. The minister expressed concern over the limited resources available to the Pakistan Coast Guards in tackling smuggling along the coastline. \"With only six operational boats to cover a 1,002-kilometer coastal border, how can we effectively counter smuggling?\" he questioned, announcing that the government plans to provide more operational boats and strengthen all border security forces. Naqvi also stressed the importance of the Safe City Project in controlling crime, calling it a key initiative endorsed by the Prime Minister. He mentioned Faisalabad as a successful model where the project has led to a decline in criminal activity and expressed his hope that similar efforts would be intensified in Karachi. On the issue of verifying employees' criminal backgrounds, the minister said the government will work with NADRA to streamline ID and SIM card verification, enabling businesses to make informed hiring decisions. Touching on narcotics, Naqvi noted that enforcement alone is not sufficient to combat drug abuse. He called for joint efforts between the government, business community, and Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF), emphasizing the need for rehabilitation centers before arresting drug users. He cited Lahore's experience, where prior actions without proper facilities had limited impact. Addressing the problem of encroachments, the minister called for strict legislation, including penalties and fines, to effectively deal with the issue. \"Without proper laws and punishments, the problem of encroachments cannot be resolved,\" he concluded.",
