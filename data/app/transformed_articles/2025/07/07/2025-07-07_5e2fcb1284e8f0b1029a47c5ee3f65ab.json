    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 07 (APP):Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) has launched a two-week \"Turkish Summer Camp\" to promote children's education, creativity and physical development in a culturally enriching environment. The initiative was formally inaugurated in a ceremony attended by children, their parents and distinguished guests including Dr. Zahid Majeed (Director, International Office), Prof. Dr. Khalil Tokar (Director, Yunus Emre Institute), the Education Attache of the Turkish Embassy in Islamabad, Dr. Mehmet Toyran and Prof. Dr. Samina Tokar, an expert in Turkish language. The speakers praised the camp as a unique educational and cultural experience for young learners and described it as a practical demonstration of the strong and enduring friendship between Pakistan and Turkiye. The summer camp, which will continue until July 18, comprises three interactive sessions held each day. The first session focuses on teaching the Turkish language, helping children learn basic vocabulary, sentences, and conversational phrases. The second session involves calligraphy training based on Islamic and Turkish cultural themes, aimed at developing the children's aesthetic and artistic abilities. The third session introduces traditional Turkish games such as archery and Mangala, encouraging physical activity and offering children a deeper, hands-on appreciation of Turkish traditions. Addressing the opening ceremony, Dr. Zahid Majeed stated that this is the University's third Turkish Summer Camp, and it continues to serve as an effective platform to nurture children's hidden talents, broaden their exposure to global cultures, and shape their personalities with confidence and awareness. He further announced that the camp's closing ceremony will feature AIOU Vice Chancellor, Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood, and the Ambassador of Turkiye to Pakistan as chief guests. Prof. Dr. Khalil Tokar, in his remarks, expressed hope that the summer camp would further strengthen the cultural and emotional bonds between the people of Pakistan and Turkiye. Education Attache Mehmet Tugrul Turker added that the camp provides children with more than just language skills-it also offers a comprehensive understanding of Turkiye's rich history, cultural values, and modern advancements. The event reflects AIOU's commitment to fostering international collaboration and cultural exchange, especially among younger generations.",
