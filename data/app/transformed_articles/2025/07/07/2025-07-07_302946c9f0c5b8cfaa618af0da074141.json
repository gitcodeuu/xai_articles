    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 7 (APP):In order to foster students' interest in space sciences, the Institute of Space Technology (IST) will hold ninth Space Summer School (SSS) 2025 from July 21 for the young science enthusiasts. The initiative organized annually since 2017, has become a cornerstone in Pakistan's efforts to foster STEM education among school students. Held under the umbrella of the Space Education Research Lab (SERL) at the National Center for GIS and Space Applications (NCGSA), the week-long program brings together students from across the country for immersive learning in space science and technology. This year's school will run from July 21 to 25, with sessions held daily from 9:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at IST's Islamabad campus. Over the years, SSS has gained recognition for its experiential learning model, combining interactive lectures, hands-on activities, software simulations, STEAM-based space projects, lab visits, and even astronomy night sessions. These activities aim to spark scientific curiosity and build foundational skills in disciplines such as rocketry, satellite engineering, aviation, astronomy, and climate science. The program is structured around two distinct academic streams: Abecedarian for students of grades 6-8, and Virtuoso for grades 9-12, allowing age-appropriate content delivery and project assignments. Students are also encouraged to work on group projects, selecting specific domains for focused mentorship and collaborative exploration. With each passing year, the Space Summer School has grown in reach and reputation, often drawing participants from dozens of educational institutions nationwide. The program continues to evolve, and this year's edition includes enhanced digital engagement, with updates being regularly shared via Facebook (@SpaceOutreach) and Instagram (@serl.ncgsa). The registration for SSS 2025 is currently open through the dedicated portals bit.ly/sssncgsa and www.ncgsa.org.pk/sss25. While seats are limited, organizers have advised students and parents to ensure early registration and confirmation to secure participation. Beyond the classrooms and labs, the Space Summer School is seen as more than just a seasonal activity. It is part of a broader national vision to integrate space science into youth education, providing students with exposure to cutting-edge research environments and encouraging interest in science-led careers. The aspiring students may contact the program coordinator, Daniyal Raza Kazmi at serl.ncgsa@gmail.com or on 0334-2949667 / 051-9075864 for further details. The Space Summer School remains a unique platform in Pakistan's academic landscape-one that continues to nurture the next generation of scientists, innovators, and space explorers.",
