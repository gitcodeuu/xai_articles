    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 07 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, has directed immediate expediting the work on development projects across Islamabad's residential sectors, along with a decisive crackdown on illegal encroachments. Chairing a high-level meeting at CDA Headquarters on Monday, Randhawa emphasized the need for high-quality construction and swift execution of infrastructure projects. The meeting was attended by senior officials including the CDA Members for Administration, Estate, Engineering, Finance and Environment, DG Works, Deputy Commissioners of Islamabad and CDA, among others. \"Development must not only be fast-tracked, but the quality and transparency of work must be non-negotiable,\" Randhawa stressed during the meeting. As part of the new strategy, the Chairman directed the establishment of on-site offices of the Deputy Commissioner CDA and other relevant officials in actively developing sectors. These field offices will serve as first points of contact for residents to submit complaints, resolve land issues, and access information. The CDA chief also announced a strict enforcement campaign to remove encroachments in key sectors including H-16, C-15, C-16, E-12, and F-13. Citizens with legitimate land or property claims in these areas are being encouraged to present their documents directly to field officials. Islamabad Administration representatives will also be available on-site to assist claimants. \"All claims will be reviewed with transparency and resolved strictly in line with the law,\" Randhawa stated, reaffirming the CDA's commitment to protecting legal rights of residents while advancing urban development. The Chairman instructed authorities to expedite development in Park Enclave and other housing sectors, and ordered that all bureaucratic or logistical hurdles be cleared on a priority basis. He also directed the Finance Wing to ensure the timely release of funds for ongoing and upcoming development projects. \"CDA is mobilizing all available resources to turn Islamabad into a model city - beautiful, well-planned and responsive to its citizens' needs,\" said Randhawa, adding that the authority is focused on both infrastructure development and resolving the city's chronic housing challenges",
