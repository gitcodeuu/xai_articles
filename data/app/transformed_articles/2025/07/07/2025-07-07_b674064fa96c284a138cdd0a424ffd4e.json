    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 07 (APP): Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reaffirmed Pakistan's unwavering and resolute support for the brotherly Republic of Azerbaijan. The speaker extended his profound gratitude for the warm reception accorded by President of Azerbaijan, Mr. Ilham Aliyev, said a news release. He commended Azerbaijan's principled and resolute stance on key regional and international issues, including its unwavering support for Pakistan's position on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also acknowledged Azerbaijan's clear and courageous positions regarding India's recent escalations against Pakistan, the situation in Gaza, and the Iran-Israel conflict, underscoring Azerbaijan's commitment to justice and adherence to international law. President Ilham Aliyev highlighted the exemplary level of bilateral relations between Azerbaijan and Pakistan. He emphasized that ties between the two brotherly nations are anchored in brotherhood, mutual support, and unwavering solidarity. President of Azerbaijan fondly recalled the recent participation of Pakistan's Prime Minister, Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, in the 17th Summit of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) held in Khankendi, noting the extensive discussions they held on key aspects of the bilateral agenda. He expressed confidence that the Pakistani delegation's visit would further deepen cooperation and strengthen the enduring partnership between the two countries. Ayaz Sadiq underscored the vital importance of inter-parliamentary relations between Azerbaijan and Pakistan, highlighting that both nations have consistently stood in unwavering solidarity with each other through challenging times as well as moments of celebration. He highlighted the symbolic significance of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif's recent visit to Azerbaijan's liberated territories, attended by several heads of state, which sent a powerful message of solidarity to the international community. He recalled two landmark resolutions presented and unanimously adopted by Pakistan's National Assembly under his leadership: the first strongly condemned Armenian aggression, including brutal attacks on Azerbaijani civilians and military operations in Nagorno-Karabakh; the second was adopted following Azerbaijan's victory and the liberation of its territories, reaffirming Pakistan's steadfast support. Ayaz Sadiq congratulated President Ilham Aliyev on the successful organization of the 17th ECO Summit in Khankendi, highlighting its significant political and diplomatic importance. He appreciated the large-scale reconstruction and restoration efforts underway in Azerbaijan's liberated areas, particularly in Nagorno-Karabakh, emphasizing the critical role of these initiatives in fostering regional stability and economic revival. He further appreciated the existing and potential opportunities for enhancing connectivity through improved road networks, and noted that the establishment of direct flights between the two brotherly countries has facilitated easier travel, which will contribute significantly to strengthening bilateral cooperation. President Ilham Aliyev welcomed the continued mutual support extended by the parliamentary delegations of both nations within international parliamentary forums, and emphasized the importance of further enhancing inter-parliamentary relations and reinforcing institutional cooperation between their respective legislative bodies. Sardar Ayaz Sadiq emphasized that the Pakistani delegation included members from both the ruling party and the opposition, reflecting a unified and resolute stance within Pakistan's National Assembly in support of Azerbaijan. Members of the delegation present during the meeting included MNAs Dr. Mahesh Kumar Malani, Muhammad Afzal Khokhar, Chaudhary Iftikhar Nazir, Sadiq Iftikhar, Umair Khan Niazi, Muhammad Moin Aamer Pirzada and Nazir Ahmed Bhugio.",
