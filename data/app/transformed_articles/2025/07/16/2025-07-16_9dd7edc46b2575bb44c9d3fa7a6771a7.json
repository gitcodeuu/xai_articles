Tax-related matters older than five years cannot be investigated, it said. During the hearing, on the court's instructions, the investigating officer showed the record to the petitioner's lawyer. Farhatullah Babar came to the rostrum and said that he is asking me to tell the money trail of the house he bought in 1980. He said that he bought a Corolla car in 1985.
