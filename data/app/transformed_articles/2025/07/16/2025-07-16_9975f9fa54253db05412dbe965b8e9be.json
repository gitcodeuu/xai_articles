    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday made the auction of 10 cricket and 10 football grounds in the federal capital by the CDA, conditional with a court decision. IHC's Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the case against the outsourcing auction of the grounds scheduled on July 18. During the hearing on the petition of former Chairman Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan, the petitioner, lawyer Adil Aziz Qazi, appeared in the court and took the position that the playgrounds were solely meant for the common citizens. According to the law, the MCI can take care of the management of the playgrounds, not the CDA, he added. He said there was a risk that the auction of the playgrounds will make the cricket and football grounds, not meant for common citizens. The court made the auction conditional on its decision and issued notices to the CDA and MCI and sought their response. Meanwhile, another petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court against the auction of 10 cricket and 10 football grounds in different sectors of the federal capital. Abu Bakr Bin Talat, President of the Rawalpindi Islamabad Sports Journalists Association (RASJA), challenged the CDA auction and took the position in the petition filed through Barrister Umar Ijaz Gilani that the CDA did not have the authority to auction the grounds. Under the Islamabad Local Government Act, playgrounds cannot be outsourced for commercial purposes, he added. \"If money is demanded to play in the grounds, the access of citizens will be limited', he added. He said the maintenance of cricket and football grounds in Islamabad was the responsibility of the Metropolitan Corporation. The court may declare that the maintenance of the grounds and provision of sports facilities there are the prerogatives of the MCI, he added.",
