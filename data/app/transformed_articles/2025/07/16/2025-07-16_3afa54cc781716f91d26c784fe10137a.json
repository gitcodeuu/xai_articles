In a meeting held at the Prime Minister's Office, PM Shehbaz commended the efforts of the Defence Minister and his team, as well as the Aviation Division, for their dedicated work in achieving this diplomatic and operational breakthrough. \"The resumption of Pakistani flights to the UK marks an extremely important achievement for the country,\" the prime minister said, noting that this step would greatly facilitate travel for the large Pakistani diaspora in the UK and boost tourism between the two countries. The PM criticized past actions by the leadership of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating that \"irresponsible statements by PTI leaders had led to the imposition of flight restrictions, which damaged Pakistan's credibility The meeting also included discussion on political and ministerial affairs, reflecting the government's broader focus on restoring Pakistan's global image and strengthening institutional cooperation.",
