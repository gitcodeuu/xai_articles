    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):In a significant move to strengthen bilateral relations, Vietnam has proposed a collaborative initiative with Pakistan to boost faith-based and cultural tourism, with a strong emphasis on their shared Buddhist heritage.The proposal was put forth on Wednesday by Pham Anh Tuan, Ambassador of Vietnam Embassy during a meeting with Minister for National Heritage & Culture, Aurangzeb Khan Khichi.Truong Van Thang, First Secretary and Quang, Second Secretary and Head of Economic and Cultural Diplomacy at the Embassy of Vietnam in Pakistan were also present in the meeting.The Ambassador also highlighted Vietnam's millennia-old civilization and rich Buddhist history, underscoring its commitment to preserving both tangible and intangible cultural heritage. \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\" he stated, emphasizing that today's meeting marks a crucial stride in the friendship and cooperation between the two nations.The Vietnamese official proposed several key areas of collaboration, including the promotion of Buddhist pilgrimage tours, cultural festivals, and joint heritage projects. A concrete step put forward was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Taxila Museum in Pakistan and leading Vietnamese museums, such as the Vietnam National Museum of History and the Museum of Vietnamese History in Ho Chi Minh City.This MOU aims to facilitate traveling exhibitions that would showcase the rich Buddhist art and heritage of both countries.An example cited was a special exhibition titled \"Buddhist Art Along the Silk Road,\" featuring masterpieces from Taxila alongside Vietnamese artifacts, offering a \"window into the past\" and a deeper appreciation of their interconnected histories.The proposed partnership extends beyond exhibitions to include facilitating regular exchanges of curators, conservators, and archaeologists to share expertise in heritage management and preservation techniques.Developing joint programs for students, researchers, and the public on Buddhist iconography, archaeological techniques, and heritage conservation.Co-publishing scholarly works and engaging in joint research projects to explore the artistic and religious links between Gandhara (an ancient region encompassing parts of modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan) and ancient Vietnam.Designing specialized Buddhist heritage tours connecting Taxila's UNESCO World Heritage sites with Vietnam's prominent Buddhist landmarks, aiming to attract international pilgrims and cultural tourists.The Ambassador stressed that such a partnership would not only enrich societies but also create new opportunities for local communities, artisans, and entrepreneurs.He affirmed Vietnam's readiness to collaborate with Pakistan on developing joint tourism packages, training programs for heritage site managers, and initiatives to digitize and promote cultural assets globally.The significance of this partnership lies in the unparalleled collections of Buddhist art in both countries. Taxila Museum is renowned for its Gandharan art, while Vietnamese museums preserve a rich tapestry of Buddhist heritage from various dynasties. Together, these collections offer a unique opportunity to showcase the shared spiritual and historical roots of South and Southeast Asia.\"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together,\" he concluded, inviting the Taxila Museum and the Ministry of National Heritage & Culture to work closely with the Vietnamese Embassy to draft and sign the MoU promptly. This initiative is seen as a powerful force for peace and understanding, demonstrating how cultural diplomacy can benefit both nations and the wider region.Minister Khichi emphasized Pakistan's readiness to collaborate, stating, \"Your proposals are very important, and we will consider them on a priority basis. We are ready to collaborate with Vietnam in heritage and culture.\" He announced plans to sign Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with Vietnam to formalize this enhanced cooperation, noting that Pakistan has already established similar agreements with over 80 countries.\"We will move forward and let us sign MoUs,\" Khichi assured the Vietnamese official, also expressing admiration for Vietnam's culture, values, and traditions.During the meeting, Secretary National Heritage and Culture Division, Asad Rehman Gillani, highlighted Pakistan's profound historical depth, spanning from the million-year-old civilizations of Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, and Gandhara. He specifically drew attention to the ancient Gandhara civilization's strong connection to Buddhism, pointing out the presence of significant Buddhist stupas in Takht-i-Bahi and Taxila.The discussion also delved into the potential for connecting the two nations through tourism.Minister Khichi underscored Pakistan's appeal for adventure tourism, particularly its numerous high peaks that attract thousands of adventurers globally. He extended an invitation to Vietnamese mountaineers and climbers to explore these majestic mountains, assuring them of excellent arrangements for foreign tourists.The Vietnamese Ambassador reciprocated the sentiment, lauding K2, the world's second-highest peak, for its global allure to mountaineers. He also remarked positively on the character of the Pakistani people, noting their \"strong ego.\"Both sides agreed to appoint a \"Focal Person\" to streamline and enhance cooperation. Secretary Gillani proposed a series of follow-up meetings as early as next week to advance these initiatives.A significant step towards boosting tourism and people-to-people contact will be the initiation of direct flights from Vietnam to Islamabad, a measure agreed upon by both delegations.To further foster cultural ties, Minister Khichi invited the Vietnamese Embassy to showcase their culture, food, and other aspects at Lok Virsa, described as Pakistan's fourth-largest cultural event.He extended this invitation to all foreign ambassadors, encouraging them to display their respective cultures at the event to establish stronger people-to-people contacts.The Minister also proposed organizing a Gandhara Exhibition in collaboration with the Vietnamese Embassy, further cementing the cultural and historical links between the two nations.Usman Shah, CEO of NIFTYSPHERE Institute was also present at the occasion, emphasized the tourism potential of the Shah Allah Ditta caves, suggesting they could attract thousands of Buddhist tourists and contribute significantly to Pakistan's economy.",
