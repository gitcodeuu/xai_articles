Intermittent rain-wind/thundershowers are expected at most places in Kashmir, Islamabad, Pothohar region, northeast Punjab, upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Scattered heavy falls-at times very heavy-are likely during the period. Isolated showers are also expected in parts of central and south Punjab as well as northeast and south Balochistan. During the night and on July 17, heavy to very heavy rains may generate flash flooding in local streams and nullahs of Kashmir, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Pothohar, northeast Punjab, Dera Ghazi Khan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Murree, Galliyat, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Swabi, Nowshera, and Mardan.
