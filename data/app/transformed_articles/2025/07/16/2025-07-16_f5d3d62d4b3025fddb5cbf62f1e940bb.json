    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):Prime Minister's Coordinator for Information, Broadcasting on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, hailed the Shehbaz Sharif-led government for their successful diplomacy in removing international restrictions on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) that opened new avenues for national carrier. In a post on X on Wednesday, Ikhtiar Wali Khan remarked, \"One of the failures during Imran Khan's government was several international restrictions on national airline. The Shahbaz Sharif government has lifted those restrictions through excellent diplomacy and now the international doors have been reopened for PIA. Thank you, Khawaja Muhammad Asif and Khawaja Saad Rafique.\" He stated that these restrictions, which had grounded PIA's international operations, were imposed during the tenure of Imran Khan and have now been lifted, terming it a major achievement. He commended Khawaja Saad Rafique for his instrumental role in restoring the Pakistan's aviation credibility at international stage. He also extended special thanks to Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Minister for Defence.",
