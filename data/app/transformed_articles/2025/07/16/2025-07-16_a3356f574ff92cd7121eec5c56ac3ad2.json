    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) hosted a special event on Wednesday in memory of the legendary literary figure, humorist, broadcaster, and diplomat Syed Ahmad Shah Patras Bokhari, to pay tribute to his exceptional contributions. The event was presided over by renowned scholar, writer, and Senator Irfan Siddiqui, with Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture, Aurangzeb Khan Khichi, serving as the chief guest. Parliamentary Secretary for National Heritage and Culture, Farah Naz Akbar, and Federal Secretary, Asad Rehman Gilani, also attended as guests of honor. This memorable event also marked the inauguration of the newly renovated conference hall, officially opened by Senator Irfan Siddiqui. Distinguished guests shared their reflections on Patras Bokhari's literary legacy and the importance of academic and literary institutions. In her welcome address, Dr. Najeeba Arif, Chairperson of the Pakistan Academy of Letters, highlighted Patras Bokhari's scholarly, literary, and diplomatic services. She offered a comprehensive analysis of his distinctive style of humor and satire, his intellectual depth, and his mastery of language and expression. She expressed gratitude to the Secretary of the National Heritage and Culture Division for allocating the funds that made the elegant renovation of the conference hall possible. She also extended special thanks to Senator Irfan Siddiqui for his ongoing support and patronage of the Academy. In his address, Senator Irfan Siddiqui presented a comparative analysis of the literary contributions of Patras Bokhari and Farhatullah Baig in the realm of Urdu humor and satire. He shared memorable anecdotes from Bokhari's life and congratulated the Academy for organizing such a meaningful event and for dedicating the renovated hall to such a towering literary figure. He assured the continued support of the government for the preservation and growth of academic and literary institutions. The event stood out for its distinctive structure, with two particularly noteworthy segments. The first was a dramatic adaptation of Patras Bokhari's famous essay \"Sowairay Jo Kal Aankh Meri Khuli\" (When I Woke Up Yesterday Morning), performed artistically by Sawang Theatre. The performance was highly praised by the audience, and Federal Minister Aurangzeb Khichi was so impressed that he announced a special prize on the spot. The second highlight was a dialogue between Dr. Farrukh Nadeem and Ayaz Bokhari, the grandson of Patras Bokhari. The conversation offered valuable insights into Patras Bokhari's life, literary brilliance, and diplomatic career. Documentaries showcasing his remarkable life journey were also screened. This session served not only as a heartfelt tribute to Patras Bokhari but also played a vital role in introducing the younger generation to the high standards of Urdu humor writing. The event was attended by members of Patras Bokhari's family, as well as a large number of literary scholars and enthusiasts.",
