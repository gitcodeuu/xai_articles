    "article_body": "MIRPUR, Jul 16 (APP):Kashmiris around the world are gearing up to observe the 78th anniversary of Kashmir's Accession to Pakistan Day on July 19. This significant day marks the historic resolution passed in 1947, which emphasized the state's accession to Pakistan. Elaborate programs are being planned by various sociopolitical and civil society organizations to strengthen and promote the ideology of Kashmir's accession to Pakistan. According to the details, on July 19, Kashmiris will renew their pledge to continue their struggle for the right to self-determination and the liberation of occupied Jammu and Kashmir from Indian subjugation. The day is observed with great fervor and enthusiasm, highlighting the importance of achieving the goal of Kashmir's accession to Pakistan. July 19 commemorates the historic resolution passed by the All Jammu Kashmir Muslim Conference in Srinagar in 1947, demanding the state's accession to Pakistan. This resolution was a turning point in the Kashmiris' struggle for liberation from Dogra rule and later from Indian imperialism. In this regard, special ceremonies will be held in towns and cities across Azad Jammu Kashmir, as well as in other parts of the world where Kashmiris reside. These events will highlight the importance of liberating occupied Jammu and Kashmir from Indian control and implementing the ideology of Kashmir's accession to Pakistan. The day will be marked with renewed determination and commitment to the cause of Kashmir's liberation.",
