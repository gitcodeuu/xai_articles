    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):Parliamentary Party Leader of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) in the Senate Senator Irfan Siddiqui emphasized the importance of literary organizations such as the Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) and pledged his continued support for such institutions. Senator Siddiqui, who is also the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, expressed these views while speaking to APP after inaugurating a newly renovated hall named after the late Sindhi poet Sheikh Ayaz, as well as following the special event held in memory of Patras Bokhari at PAL on Wednesday. Senator Siddiqui remarked that it was a wonderful event and that the institution, under the leadership of Dr Najeeba Arif, deserved great appreciation. He highlighted that two significant events took place: the inauguration of the newly renovated hall dedicated to Sheikh Ayaz, and a commemorative session honoring the remarkable literary contributions of Patras Bokhari. He further stated that Patras Bokhari's legacy was celebrated - a towering figure in humor writing, diplomacy, education, and communication. He also noted Bokhari's strong association with radio broadcasting. Senator Siddiqui praised the event, saying it was a beautiful and meaningful gathering, and emphasized that such events should continue to be organized. A large number of people attended the program, reflecting its success. He congratulated and commended Dr Najeeba Arif, Chairperson of PAL, for organizing the successful event and expressed hope that more such programs would be held in the future. He underscored that these events carry great significance for the youth, who need exposure to refined, thoughtful, and intellectually stimulating gatherings. He described the event as graceful, dignified, and engaging - a lesson in itself for the younger generation. Patras Bokhari's life, he said, was a powerful example of how one can achieve excellence across multiple fields. Senator Siddiqui noted, \"Such institutions are the soul, spirit, and identity of a nation - recognized and valued around the world. Literary institutions are cherished and protected globally.\" He expressed hope that these institutions will not only continue to exist but will flourish and grow in importance over time.",
