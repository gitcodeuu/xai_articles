    "article_body": "XI'AN, China, July 16 (APP): Pakistan on Wednesday termed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as immensely significant for the country, serving as a vital platform to advance regional peace, economic integration, and strategic collaboration. This was stated by the Federal Secretary for the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ambreen Jan, as she delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of President Asif Ali Zardari at the opening ceremony of the 2nd Television Festival of Shanghai Cooperation Organization Countries, held in Xi'an. Speaking as a guest of honour at the event titled \"Joining Civilizations: Audio-Video Creations for a Shared Future,\" Ambreen Jan said that through its mechanisms, the SCO fosters solidarity, mutual respect, and collective progress. \"Pakistan places great emphasis on promoting people-to-people ties to cultivate mutual understanding, cultural appreciation, and trust among our diverse communities,\" she said. She stated that this vibrant initiative stands as a testament to the enduring cultural and media cooperation among SCO member states. \"It plays a pivotal role in promoting people-to-people connections, showcasing our shared cultural heritage, and fostering mutual understanding and respect across diverse civilizations through the powerful medium of audio-visual storytelling,\" she added. Ambreen Jan said the event's theme resonates deeply with the core principles of the 'Shanghai Spirit,' which champions mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse cultures, and shared development. These values are vividly reflected in this event, strengthening bonds among our nations. On behalf of the Government of Pakistan, she extended heartfelt congratulations on the successful convening of the 2nd Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Television Festival.",
