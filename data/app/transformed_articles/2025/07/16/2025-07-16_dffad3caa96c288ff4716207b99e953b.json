    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP): The Islamabad Excise Department has intensified vehicle inspections along major roads to enforce traffic and tax regulations and in a recent operation, officials inspected a total of 42 vehicles and imposes fine of Rs 67,700 to violators. The inspection teams specifically targeted vehicles with dark tinted windows and non-standard number plates, both of which are prohibited under local laws due to security and identification concerns, said the spokesman of ICT administration here. As a result of the inspection, fines amounting to Rs50,000 were imposed on drivers found using unauthorized tinted windows. Additionally, a separate penalty was enforced against the use of non-compliant number plates, leading to 10 fines issued to motorists who had installed plates that did not match the officially approved format. Beyond traffic-related violations, the Excise Department also recovered outstanding vehicle token taxes during the operation. A total of Rs67,700 was collected from motorists who had not cleared their token tax dues, which are mandatory annual payments required for all registered vehicles. Officials emphasized that such actions are part of a broader campaign to ensure compliance with vehicle regulations in Islamabad. The crackdown aims to improve road safety, aid law enforcement in vehicle identification, and ensure tax collection from vehicle owners. Authorities have reiterated that inspections and enforcement will continue across various parts of the capital. The Excise Department has urged citizens to abide by the rules, remove unauthorized window tints, replace non-standard number plates, and pay their token taxes on time to avoid fines and legal action. According to the Excise Department spokesman, the drive also helps address broader security concerns in the region, where tinted windows and obscure number plates can hinder law enforcement's ability to monitor vehicle movements effectively. The Islamabad administration plans to maintain a strict check on vehicles circulating within the city, particularly on main highways and entry points. Officials warned that further operations will be carried out unannounced, with heavy penalties for repeat offenders. Motorists have been advised to ensure their vehicles meet all regulatory standards, including the proper display of number plates, removal of dark window tints, and clearance of pending taxes. Authorities believe that these steps are essential to streamline road monitoring and promote a culture of accountability among vehicle owners. The administration has called on residents to cooperate with the ongoing campaign and ensure their vehicles comply with all legal requirements. Failure to do so may lead to fines, impoundment of vehicles, or other legal consequences. The Assistant Commissioner Nilore, who oversaw the recent inspection on Express Highway, stated that the operation was conducted smoothly, with most motorists cooperating with the inspection teams. He added that such initiatives are necessary to uphold traffic discipline and ensure public safety. The authorities have pledged to continue their vigilance in ensuring that all vehicles operating in the city are in compliance with the law.",
