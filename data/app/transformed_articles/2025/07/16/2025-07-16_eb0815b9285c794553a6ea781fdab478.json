    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday welcomed the UK Air Safety Board's decision to lift the ban on Pakistani flights, saying that the \"positive development\" would improve Pakistan's international reputation and further strengthen bilateral cooperation. The prime minister, in a statement, recalled that the ban was imposed on Pakistani flights due to the irresponsible statements by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leaders, also undermining the country's reputation. He said that the lifting of ban on Pakistani flights was a matter of satisfaction for Pakistanis residing in the UK and that the resumption of PIA flights between Pakistan and the UK was a significant milestone for the country. The prime minister appreciated Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, the Ministry of Defence, and the Aviation Division for their efforts in ending the ban. He said that swift measures were being taken to enhance the competitiveness of Pakistani airlines with other international companies in the aviation sector. Prime Minister Shehbaz said that his government was also taking steps to bring in transparency and quality in the aviation sector, besides ensuring compliance with international aviation standards.",
