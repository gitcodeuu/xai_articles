    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):The Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) has issued show cause notice to the Chairman of the National Highways Authority (NHA) for repeated non-compliance and failure to appear before the Commission, despite the issuance of multiple notices regarding an appeal filed under the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017. The Commission was hearing an appeal filed by a citizen who alleged that the NHA failed to provide requested information under the provisions of the Right of Access to Information Act. In response to this appeal, the Commission issued three separate notices-dated March 18, April 14, and May 21, 2025-directing the NHA Chairman to submit written reply and ensure the attendance of a responsible officer. Despite confirmed delivery of the latest notice (verified via Pakistan Post's tracking system), no representative from NHA appeared before the Commission. In its order dated July 16, 2025, the Commission stated that the continuous non-appearance by the NHA demonstrates a willful disregard for the Commission's directives. In view of this, the Commission has issued show cause notice to the Chairman, NHA under Section 20(1)(f) of the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017. The notice requires the Chairman to explain why proceedings should not be initiated against him for non-compliance. Additionally, the Commission has directed the NHA to submit written reply to the pending appeal and ensure the appearance of the designated Public Information Officer at the next hearing, scheduled for August 20, 2025.",
