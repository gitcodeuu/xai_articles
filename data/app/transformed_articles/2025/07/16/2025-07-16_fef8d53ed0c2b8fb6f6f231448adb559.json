    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain on Wednesday reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to strengthening agricultural ties with Kenya, besides enhancing cooperation in other sector of the economy for promoting bilateral relations between both the countries. The minister held an important meeting with Lt. Gen. (Rtd.) Peter Mbogo Njiru, High Commissioner of Kenya to Pakistan and discussed avenues for enhancing bilateral cooperation, particularly in agriculture and trade, said a press release. The minister noted that the current bilateral trade between the two countries stands at approximately USD 1 billion, with Pakistan exporting rice, cotton, and seeds, while importing tea and other commodities valued at around USD 350 million. Both sides recognized the potential to further diversify and expand trade, particularly in agri-based products. The High Commissioner expressed Kenya's keen interest in institutional collaboration and confirmed his upcoming visit to the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) to explore opportunities for joint research and agricultural innovation. The Minister highlighted PARC's network of 44 specialized research institutes across the country and emphasized Pakistan's willingness to partner in areas such as seed development, livestock, cotton production, and agri-mechanization. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for agricultural and trade cooperation is expected to be discussed and potentially finalized during the Pakistan-Kenya Joint Trade Committee (JTC) meeting, scheduled to take place in Islamabad from September 11 to 18, 2025. Rana Tanveer Hussain stated that this meeting would serve as a key platform to institutionalize cooperation and finalize agreements aimed at expanding agricultural trade and knowledge exchange. The minister also acknowledged Kenya's growing interest in exporting products such as avocados, mangoes, flowers, and tea to Pakistan. He expressed particular interest in avocado imports, citing their quality and competitive pricing. He reiterated Pakistan's openness to diversifying its import basket from Kenya, noting the complementarity in the two countries' agricultural strengths. The High Commissioner highlighted the presence of 2,000 to 3,000 Pakistanis living in Kenya who are contributing in sectors such as hospitality, banking, automobile trade, and development initiatives through organizations like the Aga Khan Foundation. Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain welcomed the valuable role of the diaspora and stressed the importance of people-to-people linkages in reinforcing bilateral ties. It was also noted that Kenya maintains collaborative relations with Pakistani institutions including the National Agriculture Foundation and the National Textile University, Faisalabad. The Minister stressed the need to build on these linkages to promote joint ventures, research partnerships, and technology transfer in textiles, leather, and agricultural processing. The High Commissioner appreciated Pakistan's support over the years, particularly in the area of defense training. Many Kenyan Army and Navy officers have received training in Pakistani institutions such as the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul and the Command and Staff College in Quetta. The High Commissioner expressed his gratitude to Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain for attending the Kenyan Independence Day celebrations, calling it a gesture of goodwill and mutual respect. Both parties acknowledged the long-standing diplomatic relations between the two countries, dating back to 1964, and agreed to reinvigorate institutional ties and sectoral cooperation.",
