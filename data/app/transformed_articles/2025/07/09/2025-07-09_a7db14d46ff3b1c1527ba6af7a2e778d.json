    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 9 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Wednesday emphasized the need for coordinated and actionable steps to restore cotton's central role in the economy and improve returns for farmers. He was chairing the third meeting of the Cabinet Committee on essential cash crops here. The committee held a detailed discussion on the Cotton Plan 2025-26, focusing on immediate, medium, and long-term policy measures essential for the revival of Pakistan's cotton sector. The Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) was directed to convene a follow-up meeting next week, bringing together all relevant public and private sector stakeholders across the cotton value chain. The ministry will present an actionable implementation plan to the committee to ensure effective execution of the recommendations. The committee also reviewed wheat production projections for 2025, carry-forward stocks, and national requirements for the food year 2025-26. It was noted that sufficient wheat stocks are available to meet national demand until the next harvest. The meeting was attended by the Ministers for National Food Security, Finance, and Planning, SAPM Tariq Bajwa, and senior officials from MNFSR, Ministry of Commerce, and FBR.",
