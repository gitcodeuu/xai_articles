    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):The Parliamentary delegation led by Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq Wednesday met with Prime Minister of Republic of Azerbaijan, Ali Asadov in Baku. Ayaz Sadiq has reaffirmed Pakistan's unwavering and principled support for Azerbaijan and said that his meetings with President Ilham Aliyev and Speaker of the Milli Majlis, Sahiba Gafarova proved highly productive, said a press release received here. He felicitated the Azerbaijani leadership on the successful hosting of the 17th Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) Summit in Khankendi and noted the participation of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif in the event and his visit to Azerbaijan's liberated territories as a strong symbol of unity and solidarity. Ayaz Sadiq also appreciated Azerbaijan's consistent support for Pakistan on key regional and global matters, especially on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. The Speaker thanked the Prime Minister, President, and people of Azerbaijan for their steadfast support during India's unprovoked escalation against Pakistan. He also referred to India's recent suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and sought Azerbaijan's continued diplomatic support. The Speaker welcomed Azerbaijan's announcement of a USD 2 billion investment plan in Pakistan, describing it as a meaningful expression of brotherhood and trust. He also proposed further institutionalizing inter-parliamentary collaboration through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the National Assembly of Pakistan and the Milli Majlis and suggested staff-level exchanges to enhance mutual understanding of parliamentary procedures and legislative practices. Ayaz Sadiq also informed that the next trilateral meeting of the Speakers of the Parliaments of Azerbaijan, Pakistan and Turkiye will be held in Islamabad, likely in September 2025. Prime Minister Ali Asadov warmly welcomed the Pakistani delegation and stated that the visit would further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two brotherly nations. He reaffirmed Azerbaijan's steadfast support for Pakistan, particularly on the Kashmir issue and thanked the Government and people of Pakistan for their consistent support during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of sustained engagement across bilateral and multilateral platforms, including the UN, OIC, and ECO. He welcomed the implementation of the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA), which is expected to significantly enhance economic cooperation between the two countries. The Prime Minister also identified agriculture, science and technology, trade and energy as key sectors for expanding bilateral cooperation. He underscored that while Azerbaijan remains committed to peace, it will never compromise on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Prime Minister acknowledged the valuable role of Pakistan's armed forces during recent regional tensions.",
