    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration continued its ongoing operations against illegal encroachments and professional begging in the federal capital and arrested 13 violators. Assistant Commissioner (City) led a series of operations in different sectors of Islamabad to remove encroachments and control street begging. In separate actions, 13 individuals were detained for setting up unauthorized stalls and occupying public spaces in F-7 and G-7. These operations were carried out as part of efforts to ensure public areas remain accessible and organized. During another inspection in Sector F-6, two beggars were apprehended and shifted to the local police station. The action was part of the administration's regular monitoring in commercial and residential zones to discourage panhandling. Officials said that repeated warnings had been issued to violators regarding illegal occupation of footpaths, green belts, and roadside spaces, but many continued to ignore the notices. Enforcement teams then moved in to dismantle the structures and temporarily detain those found in violation. The Assistant Commissioner stated that such encroachments not only disrupt pedestrian movement but also affect the overall environment of the city's marketplaces and streets. Meanwhile, the crackdown on beggars is aimed at curbing organized begging groups that often operate under networks across the capital. Authorities have been instructed to identify such elements and take appropriate legal steps. All those detained were shifted to the relevant police stations for further processing under applicable municipal and legal provisions. The ICT administration confirmed that similar operations will continue in other parts of the city, and that no tolerance will be shown to those violating public space rules. The enforcement teams are also working in coordination with police and other departments to ensure smooth and lawful urban management. The public has been urged to cooperate with the administration and avoid supporting unauthorized vendors or street beggars, as it encourages illegal activity and disturbs civic order. Authorities said the purpose of these operations is to maintain a clean and orderly environment in the capital, ensuring that public facilities remain available to everyone without obstruction.",
