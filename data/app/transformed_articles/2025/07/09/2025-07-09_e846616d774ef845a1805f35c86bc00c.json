    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 9 (APP):A motorcyclist was swept away by powerful floodwaters on Wednesday while attempting to cross the submerged Korang Nullah bridge in the Sharifabad area, within the jurisdiction of Koral Police Station. An official told APP that the missing individual has been identified as Raja Mohsin Dhanyal, son of Mehmood, a resident of Baga Kotli, Sattian. He was returning home after completing his shift at a call center when the incident occurred. Qasim, an eyewitness, told that the bridge was already submerged due to the strong current of floodwaters, but Mohsin still attempted to ride across. \"The water was flowing with a dangerously fast current. He lost control and was swept away within seconds,\" he said. Rescue teams and local police arrived shortly after the incident and launched a search operation, which was still underway at the time of filing this report. The police official said that all available resources have been deployed to recover the missing individual, and the operation will continue until he is found.",
