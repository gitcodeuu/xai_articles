Emphasizing that no more relaxation and time will be given, he declared this as the final notice for the officers, asking that severe disciplinary action will be taken in cases of negligence, inefficiency or unwarranted delays. Chairing a high-level meeting at the NHA Headquarters, Aleem Khan stressed the need to swiftly complete construction, repair and expansion projects related to Highways and Motorways. He directed that the main highway connecting Gwadar Port must be completed by March 2026 while also calling for expedited work on the strategic Hoshab-Awaran-Nall Highway in Balochistan, said a press release issued here on Wednesday. In Karachi, the minister instructed for the early completion of the Lyari Expressway, ensuring high construction standards, development of green areas and tree plantation along the vacant land of NHA. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he ordered faster progress on the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Expressway. Abdul Aleem Khan further directed NHA to initiate indiscriminate operations to eliminate encroachments along Highways and present him an implementation report in this regard. He emphasized that the prime minister himself will inaugurate the major projects of NHA therefore they must be fully completed in all respects.

He also called for a nationwide survey of existing roadside spaces along NHA Highways and ordered their reallocation through new contracts, aligned with regional requirements. During the meeting, Aleem Khan was briefed on NHA's revenue streams and other key matters.
