    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):The Supreme Court on Wednesday scheduled cases of former minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain regarding May 9, for hearing after the petitioner appeared before the court of Chief Justice of Pakistan. Fawad Chaudhry, along with lawyer Faisal Chaudhry, appeared in the court of Chief Justice Mr. Yahya Afridi. Fawad Chaudhry took a stand that despite the court orders, our case was not scheduled for hearing. Advocate Faisal Chaudhry said that if a larger bench was available, the case should have been scheduled before it. Chief Justice Yahya Afridi remarked that there should be no injustice in the orders to dispose of cases in four months. He clarified that hearing one case in the Anti-Terrorism Court on a single day does not imply that all cases should be heard in different courts on the same day. The Chief Justice said that the Registrar's Office will inform you about the hearing of your case. Later, Fawad Chaudhry's case was scheduled for hearing in the Supreme Court.",
