    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):The Capital Development Authority (CDA) is set to hold a major open auction of commercial plots from July 15 to 17, offering significant investment opportunities in Islamabad's real estate, tourism, and hospitality sectors. The initiative is part of a broader plan to transform the capital into a regional hub for sports, recreation, and economic growth. The announcement came during a high-level meeting at CDA Headquarters chaired by Muhammad Ali Randhawa, Chairman CDA on Wednesday. Senior CDA officials, including members of finance, environment, engineering, and planning, as well as directors from the enforcement, sports, and DMA wings, were in attendance. During the meeting, Chairman Randhawa directed officials to ensure maximum facilitation for investors participating in the auction, which includes around 46 commercial plots and shops located in strategic areas such as the Blue Area Parking Plaza. \"To attract credible investors, the CDA must ensure transparency, accessibility of information, and efficient handling of the auction process,\" said Randhawa. He emphasized the need to set up dedicated information counters and booths where comprehensive details can be provided about the plots, auction process, and associated facilities. The plots up for auction span across multiple categories, including commercial spaces for hotels, restaurants, digital kiosks, food courts, and entertainment venues. Key sites include the Gandhara Heritage & Citizen Center, Melody Food Street, Lake View Park, and Saidpur Village. The Diplomatic Enclave will also see the introduction of digital parking and LED display infrastructure. The CDA is aligning its development strategy with the federal government's vision to uplift Islamabad's image as a vibrant city for both residents and tourists. Projects are being planned not only to stimulate economic activity but also to enhance the city's livability through sports and recreation. Director Sports and Culture informed the meeting that, under the directives of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the Planning Wing has earmarked land for 25 football fields and 25 cricket grounds across Islamabad. Work on these grounds will begin in phases. Additional plans include three futsal grounds, one indoor cricket facility, and five cricket academies. \"Sports complexes featuring swimming pools, gyms, indoor courts, and family-friendly spaces like coffee shops are also in the pipeline,\" said the Director, highlighting the dual focus on athletic development and family recreation. Chairman Randhawa reiterated the CDA's commitment to delivering these projects on time. \"We are focused on building a modern, beautiful Islamabad that offers world-class tourism, hospitality, and sports infrastructure,\" he stated.",
