An official told APP that the visit was conducted under the special directions of Inspector General of Police Islamabad, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, aimed at modernizing Safe City Islamabad's infrastructure through cutting-edge innovation. He said the delegation held a meeting with the Project Director of NCAI, where both sides discussed potential avenues for integrating AI-powered applications into the Safe City system to improve real-time monitoring, crime detection, and emergency response. He said emphasis was placed on practical collaboration in areas such as city-wide surveillance, automated threat analysis, and predictive policing. He said both institutions reaffirmed their commitment to sustained cooperation in developing AI solutions to support law enforcement and enhance public safety across the federal capital. He said Safe City Islamabad currently operates more than 700 AI-enabled cameras across critical points of the city, significantly contributing to crime prevention and rapid response.
