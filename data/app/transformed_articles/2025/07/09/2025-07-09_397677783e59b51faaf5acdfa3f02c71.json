    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):Prominent transgender rights activist Nayyab Ali on Wednesday called for increased awareness about the Ministry of Human Rights' toll-free helpline 1099, emphasizing its critical role in protecting the rights of the transgender community in Pakistan. Talking to APP, Nayyab Ali said the helpline is a crucial tool for transgender persons facing violence, discrimination, or legal challenges. \"The transgender community must be informed that help is available. Helpline 1099 offers free legal advice and support in cases of harassment and rights violations,\" she said. Launched by the Ministry of Human Rights, Helpline 1099 is operational nationwide and functions around the clock to receive complaints related to human rights abuses, including those targeting transgender individuals under the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018. Nayyab Ali stressed the need for grassroots campaigns, community outreach, and collaboration with media and civil society to ensure transgender persons across urban and rural areas are aware of their right to seek assistance.",
