    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 9 (APP):Director General of Operations at Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal (PBM) Professor Dr. Zeeshan Danish announced on Wednesday that PBM will implement an e-governance and digital system at the district level to enhance transparency, broaden outreach, and improve the efficiency of its welfare services. Speaking during a high-level meeting at PBM's headquarters, he said this initiative reflects the organization's commitment to integrity and innovation in serving Pakistan's vulnerable communities. He expressed confidence that the transformation will enable PBM to mark new milestones of success and progress in social protection, ultimately benefiting more individuals in need and improving transparency and accountability within welfare operations. The meeting, convened under the directives of Managing Director PBM Senator Captain Shaheen Khalid Butt, brought together more than fifty senior officers in person, with regional participants joining remotely via Zoom. In the initial session, attendees identified challenges hindering PBM's daily operations and offered practical solutions for improvement. Dr. Danish stated that MD Butt had issued clear instructions to prioritize prompt, dignified assistance to patients, students, and other applicants. A comprehensive performance review was conducted during the session, leading to decisions aimed at restructuring PBM and improving the effectiveness of ongoing public welfare projects. Additional plans include a nationwide awareness campaign focusing on the prevention of life-threatening diseases such as thalassemia and cancer. The meeting also emphasized strengthening PBM's collaborations with other welfare organizations to manage rising demands and resource constraints. It was agreed that professional training courses will be introduced to enhance the skills and productivity of PBM employees. Concluding the session, Dr. Danish expressed appreciation for the active involvement and insightful suggestions offered by attendees. He voiced optimism that these reforms will empower PBM to reach more people in need and mark new milestones in social welfare and protection.",
