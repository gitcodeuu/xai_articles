    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Thursday hailed the recent court verdicts against those involved in the May 9 riots, calling them a \"historic precedent\" that will deter future conspiracies against the state. Talking to the media, Tarar termed the ransacking of Lahore's Jinnah House to the work of \"professional dacoits\" and emphasized that the culprits have now been sentenced. \"The verdicts have set a precedent, henceforth, no one would dare to commit such a conspiracy again,\" he stated. The minister said the country is now on a path of unity and progress, with the legal actions reinforcing national stability. Tarar said the \"sinister motives\" behind the May 9 events have been exposed and defeated. Hostile rhetoric against the state has been neutralized and Pakistan has established its hegemony, he said, adding \"Modi is being grilled in the Indian parliament as a defeated Modi and a defeated person.\" Tarar welcomed the verdicts awarded to those involved in May 9 riots, describing them as a \"good omen\" for Pakistan. He reiterated that the destruction of public property would no longer be tolerated and that justice has prevailed.",
