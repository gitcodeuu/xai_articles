The event took place at Aiwan-e-Quaid under the auspices of the Nazariya Pakistan Council, said a press release issued here on Thursday. In his address, renowned poet and intellectual Dr. Waheed Ahmed said that although he has attended numerous events at the NPC, this gathering had a unique warmth and flavour of its own. He remarked that the words and conversations of the participants carried the fragrance of friendship, sincerity, and love. He praised the Council's efforts in dedicating the event to friendship. Speaking on the occasion, guest of honour Syed Samar Raza shared that, in his personal study and observation, the highest and purest form of friendship exists between the Creator and a mother. He said that Allah Almighty granted mothers the greatest honour by placing paradise beneath their feet. NPC Chairman Mian Muhammad Javed remarked that friendship dispels suffocation in society. He added, \"After the people's revolution in Bangladesh, we have once again extended a hand of friendship. We pray that our ties of friendship with Bangladesh are renewed.\" The Council's Senior Vice Chairman, Faisal Zahid Malik, also underscored the importance of friendship. He said that a person does not choose their relatives, but friends are chosen by one's own will. \"It is said that a man without a friend is the poorest man of all. Therefore, we must always cherish our lifelong friends,\" he added. Senior member of the NPC Executive Council and former ambassador Salahuddin Chaudhry recited his English poem titled \"Welcome Friendship.\" NPC Director of Programmes, Hameed Qaiser, remarked that Islam is a religion of nature, rooted in human compassion, peace, and love. \"Friendship adds beauty to life,\" he said. He added that the Council had gathered its dearest friends for meaningful dialogue on the theme of friendship, noting, \"Today, we are blessed to have friends who are like precious gems.\" Participants at the event also shared their views on friendship, saying, \"Friendship knows no language, colour, or race, and is a bond of pure sincerity.\" They said that friendship untangles knots within the human spirit and brings inner peace. They stressed the importance of choosing friends wisely, as making good friends is the foundation of a humane society.
