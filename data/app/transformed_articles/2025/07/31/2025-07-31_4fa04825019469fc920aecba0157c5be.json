    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): The Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), in collaboration with the Government of Balochistan, organized a two-day seminar titled \"Women's Economic Empowerment and Building Sustainable Ecosystems for Women Entrepreneurs\" under the GRASP (Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress) project. The event, held in Quetta on July 30-31, aimed to strengthen policy dialogue, institutional support, and grassroots engagement to boost the role of women in economic development, particularly in entrepreneurship, agriculture, and livestock. The first day of the seminar was hosted at the Governor House, where federal and provincial leaders-including the Governor of Balochistan, Federal Ministers for Education and Poverty Alleviation, and provincial ministers-participated in discussions focused on empowering women as economic drivers. The second day continued the momentum, featuring the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Balochistan Assembly, along with senior government officials, civil society representatives, academics, and media. The broad participation reflected a united commitment to creating inclusive and sustainable economic opportunities for women. A highlight of both days was the exhibition of women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) supported by the GRASP project. Showcasing ventures in agriculture, livestock, food processing, and traditional crafts, the stalls demonstrated the innovation and resilience of Balochistan's women entrepreneurs. Visiting the exhibition, the Governor praised the entrepreneurial spirit of rural women and stressed the need for continued institutional and policy support. The Speaker of the Balochistan Assembly echoed this sentiment, saying that empowering women is not only a social priority but an economic necessity. The seminars emphasized building ecosystems that give women equal access to finance, digital tools, training, markets, land ownership, and gender-sensitive policies. Discussions also focused on integrating entrepreneurship and vocational skills into the education system to enable women to lead in various sectors. Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training stated, \"Education is the foundation of empowerment. By linking learning with entrepreneurship, we equip women not just to earn, but to lead.\" Federal Minister for Poverty Alleviation added, \"Empowerment begins at the grassroots. When women have access to tools, knowledge, and ownership, they uplift entire communities.\" Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola stressed the need for data-backed legislation and strategic budgeting to support rural women, while the Advisor to the Chief Minister on Women Development called for system-wide planning to place women at the heart of digital and agricultural development. Senior government officials, including the Director General of Public Relations and secretaries of Women Development, Agriculture, and Planning departments, also addressed the event. The Secretary of Women's Development said the department was aligned with government goals for inclusive growth, while the Agriculture Secretary acknowledged the historical under-recognition of women's contributions and vowed to make the sector more gender-inclusive. Academics and researchers added depth to the discussions by providing evidence-based insights on policy gaps, gender equity, and market access, reinforcing the need for long-term reforms. The two-day seminar served as a platform for cross-sector collaboration and policy momentum, reaffirming the commitment to building a more inclusive and sustainable economic future for women across Balochistan.",
