    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): The Ministry of Human Rights held the 8th meeting of the National Task Force on Human Rights, chaired by Federal Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar and co-chaired by Senator Dr. Afnan Ullah Khan and Secretary Abdul Khalique Shaikh. Representatives from key federal and provincial departments, including Law, Interior, Foreign Affairs, Women Development, and Police attended the meeting. The Minister emphasized the importance of activating District Human Rights Committees across all provinces and sharing best practices to improve protection for vulnerable groups, particularly women, children, and minorities, in line with constitutional guarantees. Progress on the Action Plan for Human Rights, approved in 2016 and revised in 2020, was reviewed. The Secretary, MoHR, stressed expediting past decisions, including strengthening Treaty Implementation Cells in Balochistan and KP and reactivating provincial task forces. The provinces were urged to speed up legislation against child marriage and complete appointments to Provincial Commissions on the Status of Women within 30 days. The Chair also called for dissemination of the 2023 Federal Shariat Court judgment on marriage age limits. A special committee of federal and provincial secretaries was formed to propose measures to improve Pakistan's ranking in the Gender Parity Report. The meeting concluded with a unified commitment to strengthen human rights protections at the grassroots level.",
