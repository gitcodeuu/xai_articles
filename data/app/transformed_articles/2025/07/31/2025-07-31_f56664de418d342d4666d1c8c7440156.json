Taking to his official social media platform, 'X' (formerly Twitter), Ambassador Moghadam wrote, \"On the occasion of July 31st, the birth anniversary of Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah, I pay my sincere tribute to her exemplary and inspiring character. Everyone in Pakistan honors her visionary leadership, relentless courage, and invaluable contributions to Pakistan and the Muslim world.\" Echoing the sentiments, the Embassy of Iran in Pakistan also issued a statement highlighting Fatima Jinnah's lasting influence. Quoting her words, \"People of Pakistan are by nature devoted to the cause of peace and goodwill,\" the embassy underscored her commitment to unity, democracy, and human dignity. \"On this day, we honor her inspiring character as a woman and a Muslim leader who stood tall in times of national struggle and transformation,\" the statement added. Fatima Jinnah, sister of Pakistan's founding father Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, remains a symbol of democratic values and women's empowerment in South Asia. Her memory continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world - a legacy that transcends borders and remains deeply admired by regional partners like Iran.",
