    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and Islamic Relief Pakistan (IRP) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen collaboration on climate change, sustainable economic practices, and social development initiatives across Pakistan. The MoU, signed by SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri and IRP Country Director Asif Ali Sherazi, sets out a three-year framework for joint action in areas such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, policy advocacy, humanitarian response, circular economy promotion, green jobs creation, and digitalization for sustainable development, said a press release issued on Thursday. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Dr Suleri emphasized the importance of partnerships in tackling Pakistan's most pressing development challenges. \"Collaborative efforts between research institutes and humanitarian organizations can bridge knowledge gaps and translate evidence-based policy recommendations into real-world impact,\" he said. Asif Ali Sherazi highlighted Islamic Relief's commitment to advancing climate justice and social protection for vulnerable communities. \"This partnership will allow us to pool resources, expertise, and networks to scale up our impact on climate action and humanitarian response across the country,\" he stated. Under the MoU, both organizations will engage in joint research initiatives, capacity-building programmes for the youth and corporate sector, policy dialogue platforms, and advocacy campaigns aimed at accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Pakistan. The agreement also allows for joint funding applications and consortium-based projects to maximize outreach and effectiveness.",
