    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast widespread rain-wind/thundershowers for Friday in various parts of the country, accompanied by a flash flood warning in vulnerable districts due to expected heavy downpours. Rain is likely in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), northeastern Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Kashmir, while hot and humid weather will prevail in other parts of the country, particularly Sindh and southern Balochistan. The PMD has warned that heavy rainfall overnight and today may generate flash flooding in local nullahs and streams in parts of KP including Dir, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Kohat, Karak, Hangu, and Tank, as well as DG Khan, South Punjab, Murree, Galliyat, and Kashmir. Citizens are advised to take precautionary measures as windstorms, lightning and heavy downpours may damage vulnerable structures such as kacha houses, electric poles, billboards, solar panels, and parked vehicles. In Islamabad, partly cloudy skies are expected with a 40 percent chance of rain and thunderstorms. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rainfall is expected in Chitral, Swat, Buner, Shangla, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Peshawar, and southern districts including Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Waziristan, and Tank.
