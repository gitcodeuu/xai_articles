    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): China's civil nuclear cooperation with Pakistan has led to the generation of 4,000 megawatts of electricity and the creation of over 50,000 jobs, significantly contributing to Pakistan's clean energy ambitions. These insights were shared by international experts during a webinar titled \"Nuclear Energy for Green Transition\", organized by the Asian Institute of Ecocivilization Research and Development (AIERD), said a press release received here on Thursday. Prime Minister's Coordinator on Climate Change, Romina Khursheed Alam said Pakistan must benefit from the emerging technologies to pursue the agenda of green growth, sustainable development, and Sustainable Development Goals. Pakistan must explore all options to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change and GHG emissions. It is direly needed as Pakistan is highly vulnerable to climate change. She informed the audience that China and Pakistan have developed a strong relationship to pursue the agenda of green transition. China is assisting Pakistan in multiple ways to go for a green transition, including investment in green and renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind energy. China and Pakistan have also forged a partnership to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy for the betterment of humanity. Fan Siyuan, Manager at China National Nuclear Cooperation for Asia, highlighted that the civil nuclear partnership between Pakistan and China has created 10,000 direct and 40,000 indirect jobs in Pakistan while enhancing the country's energy capacity by 4,000 MW. She stated that China possesses complete command over the nuclear energy supply chain-including software and hardware-which enables it to offer fast, affordable, and sustainable energy solutions with reliability. She noted that Pakistan and China have developed a robust partnership over the years to pursue green development through peaceful nuclear cooperation. Addressing the webinar, Prof. Dr. Eng. Yousry Abushady of Egypt, a former head of Safeguard Operations at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), emphasized the need for the IAEA to guarantee nuclear fuel supply through the LEU (Low Enriched Uranium) Bank based in Kazakhstan. Dr. Jason Ross from the United States presented a futuristic view of nuclear energy, asserting that nuclear fission and fusion are essential for future energy systems. CEO of AIERD, Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, concluded the session by reiterating that China remains a steadfast partner in Pakistan's green transition. He noted that Pakistan currently has an installed nuclear power capacity of 4,000 MW, with plans to expand it to 40,000 MW by 2050 under ongoing cooperation with China.",
