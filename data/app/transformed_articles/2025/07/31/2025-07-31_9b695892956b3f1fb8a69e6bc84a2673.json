    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): The District and Sessions Court of Islamabad Thursday postponed the hearing of a case involving alleged possession of alcohol and illegal weapons against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur after he failed to appear before the court. Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the hearing. During the proceedings, Gandapur's lawyer, Raja Zahoor-ul-Hasan, appeared before the court and informed the judge that the chief minister was occupied due to the Senate by-election in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In response, the judge suggested that the defence file a formal exemption request from personal appearance. The court took a break to wait for the written plea. When the hearing resumed, the exemption request was submitted. After reviewing the application, the court accepted the plea and granted temporary exemption to Gandapur from attending the hearing. The court also directed that arguments on Gandapur's statement under Section 342 and his acquittal request be presented at the next hearing. The case was adjourned until September 6. The case against Gandapur was registered at the Bara Kahu Police Station and involves allegations related to possession of alcohol and illegal arms. Further proceedings will continue in the upcoming hearing.",
