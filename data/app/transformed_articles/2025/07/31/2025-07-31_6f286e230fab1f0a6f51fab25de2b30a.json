    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police on Thursday arrested a man involved in deceiving citizens with false promises of overseas employment and job opportunities, recovering illegal weapons from his possession. A police spokesperson told APP that the Noon Police Station carried out a successful operation and apprehended the suspect identified as Makhdoomzada Abdul Karim, who was allegedly involved in extorting large sums of money from multiple individuals by offering fake immigration and employment deals abroad. He said the accused had been operating a scam that lured victims with promises of foreign visas and job placements. Several cases had already been registered against him, and further investigations are underway to identify other possible accomplices and victims. DIG Muhammad Jawad Tariq said the suspect will be presented before the court with solid evidence. He added that protecting the life and property of citizens is the top priority of the Islamabad Police and anyone involved in endangering public trust will be dealt with strictly. DIG Tariq urged citizens to remain cautious of such fraudulent individuals and advised that all agreements related to employment or immigration should be made through legal channels and verified by relevant authorities. He encouraged the public not to hesitate in contacting the police in case of any suspected fraud or deceit.",
