    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):Patron Kashmir Campaign Global, Nazir Ahmed Qureshi, on Sunday emphasized that a strong and stable Pakistan was essential for the realization of freedom of Kashmir, reaffirming the country's vital role as both a principal party to the dispute and a resolute advocate for the Kashmiri right to self-determination on international platforms. \"Pakistan is not only a principal party to the Kashmir dispute but also a consistent and committed advocate of the Kashmiri cause,\" Qureshi said during a meeting with the representatives of the United Kashmir Journalists Association (UKJA). Qureshi commended Pakistan's diplomatic, moral and political efforts in highlighting the plight of Kashmiris without delay and emphasized that a strong, stable, and resilient Pakistan was essential to achieving the long-cherished goal of Kashmir's freedom. Referring to recent developments, he noted that Pakistan's unprecedented success in countering Indian aggression from May 4 to May 10 has significantly boosted its regional standing and enhanced its image globally. \"India, which once claimed regional supremacy, has seen its narrative weakened,\" he remarked. Qureshi observed that this recent triumph against India has rekindled hope among Kashmiris and given fresh impetus to their ongoing freedom struggle. He asserted that the people of Kashmir remained unwavering in their determination and will continue their resistance regardless of the challenges ahead. Underscoring the strategic importance of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Qureshi called for its transformation into a true \"base camp\" of the freedom movement. He stressed the need for greater unity, coordination, and mutual respect among various Kashmiri political and social groups to strengthen their collective efforts. He also underscored the deep ideological connection between Pakistan and Islam, describing it as the \"fortress of Islam\" and stressing the need to strengthen it across all dimensions-political, economic, and social. Expressing unwavering optimism, he noted that while freedom movements naturally face periods of hardship, the dawn of Kashmir's liberation is inevitable. Addressing the challenges faced by the Kashmiri diaspora, particularly those who have migrated to Pakistan due to conflict, Qureshi agreed on the establishment of a comprehensive databank. This initiative, he said, would help identify and support deserving families in areas such as livelihood, healthcare, and education. He noted that many individuals within the community were willing to contribute to this noble cause and emphasized the urgent need for organized data to streamline assistance efforts.",
