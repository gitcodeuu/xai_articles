    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):In a bid to enhance public access to digital identity services, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) organized a special awareness campaign at Centaurus Mall, Islamabad, highlighting the features and benefits of its Pak ID Mobile App. The dedicated stall, set up on Saturday and operational from morning till late evening, witnessed overwhelming public interest. Hundreds of citizens visited the stall, where NADRA representatives assisted them in downloading the app and guided them through its wide range of digital features. Visitors praised the initiative, calling it a significant step toward digital governance. Many citizens appreciated NADRA's continued efforts to adapt to modern technological trends and its commitment to making identity services more accessible. \"NADRA is setting a benchmark among public institutions by introducing user-friendly solutions and making sure people know how to benefit from them,\" said one visitor. Some attendees expressed amazement at the level of convenience now available through the mobile app. \"It's a great relief to know we no longer need to make repeated visits to NADRA offices. Everything is now just a few taps away,\" remarked another participant. In the era of technology, NADRA urges the public to use its mobile application for quicker, easier, and more convenient service delivery with many more citizen focused services on the way to make life even simpler,\" said Syed Shabahat Ali, Spokesman NADRA. We are also going to reach the people in other major cities of the country. It's important to note that this convenience is coming at no additional cost, he said.",
