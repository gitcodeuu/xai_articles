    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration temporarily opened the spillways of Rawal Dam early Sunday morning to manage rising water levels caused by recent rainfall in Islamabad and nearby areas. The spillways were later closed after water levels receded. According to the spokesman of ICT administration, the Rawal Dam spillways were opened at 6:00 AM when the water level reached 1,750 feet, following rains in Islamabad and surrounding areas. The decision was taken as part of a routine measure to release excess water and prevent overflow. Water continued to flow out of the dam for nearly 12 hours. During this time, officials closely monitored the situation to ensure safety across the region, especially around low-lying bridges and streams. As the water level dropped to 1,747 feet by the evening, the authorities shut the spillways. Before opening the spillways, emergency teams including Rescue 1122, along with staff from other departments, were deployed at vulnerable points. These included areas near bridges, streams, and low-lying zones where the released water could potentially affect traffic or residential areas. Assistant Commissioner of Nilore oversaw the water release operation and remained on-site to coordinate between teams. Safety protocols were in place throughout the process to avoid any untoward incident. Officials stated that the water level in Rawal Dam fluctuates with changes in rainfall patterns. The recent rise was attributed to continuous rain spells over the past few days in the capital and surrounding regions. The local administration and dam authorities maintain regular checks on the dam's water level to ensure timely action. Whenever the water approaches the maximum limit, spillways are opened temporarily to manage pressure and prevent any damage to the structure or nearby settlements. Authorities advised citizens living near streams and low-lying areas to stay informed through official updates and avoid going near water channels during or after heavy rainfall. Officials also confirmed that the dam remains stable and there is no immediate threat to surrounding areas. The situation is being monitored continuously, and further measures will be taken if rain continues in the region.",
