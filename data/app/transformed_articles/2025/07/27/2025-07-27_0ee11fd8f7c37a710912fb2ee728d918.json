    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):Final-year students of the BS Fashion Design program at the National Textile University (NTU) Faisalabad showcased their creativity, vision, and technical skill during an impressive fashion show held as part of their academic evaluation. Emphasizing themes of sustainability and cultural relevance, the show reflected the growing global trend of conscious and innovative fashion. The event, a key feature of the final semester, drew attention from prominent figures in the fashion and textile industry. A large number of fashion professionals, designers, and academics attended the show, offering praise and encouragement to the graduating batch for their originality and craftsmanship. The students presented a diverse range of concepts-from deeply symbolic collections to garments inspired by Pakistan's cultural and architectural heritage. The runway featured themes that ranged from minimal modern aesthetics to bold experimental structures, with some students also exploring sustainable design practices and paper upcycled materials. One of the standout presentations came from Laiba Javed Rai, who described her display as a symbolic tribute to the life cycle of an eagle. \"My garments represent the strength and transformation of an eagle. When its beak breaks and wings weaken, it renews itself and rises again, soaring with even greater power. This metaphor reflects my own journey as a designer,\" she shared. She added that her collection is entirely handcrafted, incorporating bead weaving techniques and created using upcycled paper materials to promote sustainable fashion. Her work drew special praise from her mentors, Professor Afzal and Professor Umar, who declared her a 'future star in fashion design' due to her originality, skill, and thoughtful execution. Another student, Roha, drew attention for her geometrically inspired garments. \"My design takes its inspiration from the architectural form of Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. I translated that geometric beauty into textile art using the smocking technique,\" she said, explaining the detailed fabric manipulation used in her pieces. According to university faculty, the show is an integral part of the students' final evaluation, and marks are awarded based on creativity, execution, presentation, and thematic coherence. \"This fashion show is not just a display - it's a culmination of four years of hard work, learning, and evolution,\" said one of the supervising professors. Fashion industry guests praised the emerging talent and noted that such events bridge the gap between academia and the commercial fashion world. Many participants were offered mentorship opportunities and industry networking leads. The event concluded with applause from guests, recognition from faculty, and a shared sense of accomplishment among the students. For many, it marked not just the end of their academic journey, but the beginning of their careers in the competitive world of fashion design.",
