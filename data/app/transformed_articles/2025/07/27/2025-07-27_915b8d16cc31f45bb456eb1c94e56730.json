    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):The Islamabad Transport Authority (ITA) has released a performance report on its Vehicle Emission Testing System, showing that inspections are actively underway across the federal capital. The initiative, aimed at monitoring vehicle emissions and reducing environmental pollution, has so far led to the inspection of 1,935 vehicles in various parts of the city. Out of the total vehicles inspected, 1,874 met the required emission standards and were issued clearance stickers. However, six vehicles were flagged for exceeding the acceptable carbon monoxide limit of six percent. These vehicles were issued formal warnings and asked to address their emission issues. The report also highlights the progress made over the last 24 hours. During this period, 213 vehicles were checked, out of which 209 passed the emission test, while four received warnings for failing to meet the required standards. Chairman of the Islamabad Transport Authority, Irfan Nawaz Memon, said the inspection campaign is being extended across all areas of the city. He added that this initiative is part of the authority's broader effort to reduce vehicular emissions and tackle the growing challenge of air pollution in Islamabad. \"We are committed to expanding these checks citywide,\" Memon said, noting that vehicles failing to undergo emission testing will face action in the second phase of the campaign. The upcoming phase is expected to include penalties and enforcement measures against non-compliant drivers. Memon also emphasized the importance of public cooperation in controlling air pollution. He urged vehicle owners to voluntarily bring their cars in for inspection, stating that collective responsibility is necessary to maintain clean air in the capital. \"Emission from vehicles is one of the leading causes of urban air pollution,\" he stated. \"We will take all necessary steps to prevent this source of pollution in Islamabad.\" The ongoing inspection campaign is being monitored closely, and updates are being compiled to track its effectiveness. ITA officials said that the process involves checking exhaust levels, particularly the presence of carbon monoxide, which is harmful to both human health and the environment. The clearance sticker issued to compliant vehicles is an important part of the system, helping traffic officials and enforcement teams identify vehicles that have passed the emission test. ITA officials also confirmed that the campaign is being carried out in collaboration with the Islamabad Traffic Police and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). This coordination is aimed at ensuring enforcement and technical support throughout the process. According to ITA sources, the inspection points are being set up at various locations across the city, including major roads and entry points. Mobile teams are also being deployed to carry out surprise checks in busy areas and near commercial zones. The Islamabad Transport Authority has requested all vehicle owners to support the emission testing drive by ensuring timely inspections and necessary repairs. Officials said that those who ignore the warnings or delay compliance may face fines or vehicle impoundment during the second phase. The authority has also announced plans to launch an awareness campaign to educate the public on the importance of vehicle maintenance and emission control. Pamphlets, social media messages, and radio announcements will be used to spread information about the process and its environmental benefits. By making vehicle inspection a routine process and enforcing emission limits, the Islamabad administration aims to improve the city's air quality and protect public health.",
