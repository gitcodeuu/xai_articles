    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 21 (APP): Senators on Monday strongly denounced a brutal incident of honour killing in Balochistan, where a man and a woman were reportedly shot dead. While debating a motion moved by Senator Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur to highlight the need for policy-level intervention by the government to eliminate gender discrimination and promote women's participation in economic activities nationwide, lawmakers condemned the practice as \"barbaric and inhumane,\" affirming that no civilized society can tolerate such atrocities. They demanded swift and decisive action against the perpetrators and stressed the need for justice. Senator Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui urged the House not only to condemn the barbaric incident, but also to recommend concrete measures to prevent such tragedies from recurring. He expressed concern over the provincial government's apparent inaction, noting that despite the incident having occurred two months earlier, it only came to light following the circulation of a video on social media. He urged fellow senators-particularly those from Balochistan-to unite in efforts to dismantle the self-imposed system, where individuals assume the roles of judge, jury, and executioner without any lawful authority to do so. He said the brutal incident has brought shame to the entire nation. However, he stressed that mere condemnation is not enough unless the root causes behind the unlawful killing of the couple are addressed. Senator Ali Zafar proposed the formation of a monitoring committee to ensure that the culprits involved in the honour killing are brought to justice within a fortnight. Among those voicing concern were Senators Sherry Rehman, Khalida Ateeb, Aimal Wali Khan, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, Ali Zafar, and Samina Mumtaz Zehri.",
