    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 22 (APP):As heavy monsoon showers continue to drench Islamabad, on Tuesday, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has jumped into action with a city-wide emergency response plan to protect residents from flooding and waterlogging.

Led by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and supervised by CDA Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, the plan includes round-the-clock monitoring, rapid-response teams, and efforts to clear drains and flooded roads - all aimed at keeping the city running safely during the rainy season. \"Our top priority is preparedness and prevention,\" said Chairman Randhawa. \"We're working closely with all departments to ensure immediate action in any emergency.\" He said CDA is preparing Islamabad for more rainy days ahead, like dewatering machines have been sent to low-lying areas to quickly drain standing water. Storm drains and nullahs in critical areas like IJP Road, Khanna Pul, and Sector E-11 are being cleaned regularly to prevent blockages. A modern rain monitoring system is being installed to track water levels in real time. Rapid-response teams, armed with the latest equipment, are on standby 24/7. Public awareness campaigns are being run on social media and local channels to keep citizens informed. The CDA has launched an emergency helpline - 1334 - along with a central control room to handle public complaints. Whether it's water accumulation outside your home, a blocked drain, or a sewer overflow, citizens are urged to call and report it immediately. \"We're here to respond fast, but we need the public's help too,\" Randhawa said. Beyond the monsoon season, the CDA is working on long-term fixes - including upgrading the city's drainage systems and setting up rainwater harvesting projects so that the rainwater can be stored and reused, not wasted. Citizens are also being urged not to throw garbage into drains, as it can lead to dangerous blockages. \"A little cooperation from the public can go a long way in keeping Islamabad clean and safe,\" officials said. With more rain in the forecast, the CDA is calling on all residents to stay alert, report issues, and do their part to help keep the capital flood-free.",
