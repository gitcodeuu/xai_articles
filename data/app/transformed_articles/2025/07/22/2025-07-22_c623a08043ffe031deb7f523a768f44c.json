    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 22 (APP):Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) on Tuesday urged citizens to adopt safe driving practices amid ongoing heavy monsoon rains, issuing a citywide advisory supported by real-time assistance, rapid response units, and continuous road monitoring. Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (R) Syed Zeeshan Haider told APP that traffic officers had been actively deployed across the city to facilitate citizens and maintain traffic flow during the downpour. He said the officers were working diligently to ensure uninterrupted vehicular movement despite challenging weather conditions. He advised motorists to reduce their speed, increase braking distance, and maintain a safe gap between vehicles to prevent accidents. \"Avoid unnecessary travel in areas where water has accumulated on roads,\" he added. He urged drivers to keep headlights on, ensure wipers are functional, and keep the front windshield clean to maintain visibility during rain and fog. \"Caution, patience, and safety are the keys to safe driving in such conditions,\" the CTO Zeeshan emphasized. Motorcyclists, he said, should wear helmets and raincoats during the rain for their safety. He further requested citizens to avoid parking on roadsides and instead use designated parking areas to prevent disruptions. \"In case of emergencies or vehicle breakdowns, citizens may call the ITP Helpline at 1915 for assistance,\" he said, adding that ITP's \"Mechanic & Wakeel\" teams were stationed on major roads to provide immediate roadside support. He also encouraged the public to stay informed about traffic updates by following ITP's official social media platforms.",
