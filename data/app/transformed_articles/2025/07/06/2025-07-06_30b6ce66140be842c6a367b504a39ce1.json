    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 06 (APP): Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi led a massive, seven-tier security operation involving over 5,800 personnel to ensure the peaceful conclusion of the central 9th Muharram procession in Sector G-6 of Islamabad, despite intense heat and challenging conditions. A police spokesperson told APP on Sunday that more than 5,800 personnel, including male and female officers, were deployed to ensure the safety of mourners participating in the religious gathering. IG Rizvi informed that the security arrangements included seven-tier protection, with inner and outer cordons, flanking deployments, and rooftop security to prevent any untoward incident. IG Rizvi said that three Deputy Inspectors General (DIGs), six Senior Superintendents of Police (SSPs), and nine Superintendents of Police (SPs) were present on duty, while officials from District Police, Investigation Wing, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), CIA, and all five divisions remained active throughout the operation. IGP Rizvi appreciated the dedication and performance of all officers and personnel, saying, \"I am proud of each officer and jawan who stood in the intense heat for 16 hours and performed their duties with unmatched courage and commitment.\" He also extended special thanks to the Islamabad administration, Pakistan Army, and Pakistan Rangers for their cooperation, highlighting the excellent coordination among all security agencies. Despite the sweltering conditions, the deployed force performed their duties diligently and earned high praise from the police chief.",
