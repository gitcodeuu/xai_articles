    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 06 (APP): Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in his message on the occasion of Youm-e-Ashura, paid tribute to the sacrifice of Imam Hussain (A.S.), calling the event of Karbala a timeless lesson of courage, truth, and unwavering faith. He stated that \"Imam Hussain (A.S.) with his precious blood drew a clear and eternal boundary between truth and falsehood. His philosophy remains a guiding light for all of humanity. \"Highlighting the spiritual and moral essence of Ashura, the minister added that \"The path of faith shines only through action, as taught by the grandson of the Prophet (PBUH).\" Naqvi emphasized that Ashura is not merely a historical date but a \"Center of awakening, where faith triumphed over the sword and the greatest sacrifice ensured the survival of Islam.\" Condemning oppressive regimes, he remarked, \"Yazeed was the name of arrogant power that was wiped out, while Hussain (A.S.) is an eternal symbol of truth and righteousness.\" He further noted that \"despite being denied water, Imam Hussain (A.S.) delivered a message that continues to spiritually nourish the faithful to this day.\" The minister drew parallels between the forces of Yazeed and modern-day conspiracies, particularly referring to \"the mischief of India\", which he alleged was working to fulfill nefarious designs. He called upon the nation to \"follow the luminous teachings of Imam Hussain (A.S.) to foil these evil ambitions.\" Stressing unity, Naqvi urged Pakistanis to \"rise above internal divisions and stand together against false forces to safeguard the country.\" He concluded with a prayer: \"May Allah grant us the strength to follow the path of Imam Hussain (A.S.).\" Ashura, the 10th of Muharram, commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (A.S.) and his companions in the Battle of Karbala - an event deeply revered across the Muslim world for its enduring message of sacrifice, resistance, and moral clarity.",
