    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 06 (APP):The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a warning for widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers expected across several regions of the country from the night of July 06-08. The wet spell is likely to bring heavy to very heavy rainfall at various locations, with potential risks of flash floods, urban flooding, and landslides, particularly in the northern and hilly areas.

Isolated heavy downpours are expected in Upper Punjab, the Potohar region, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and northern Balochistan.
