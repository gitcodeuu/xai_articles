APHC spokesman Advocate Abdul Rashid Minhas said in a statement that communal and corrupt administration led by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, acting on the orders Indian Home Ministry, continues to target Kashmiris through property attachments, rights violations, and suppression of dissent using draconian laws. However, he asserted, such tactics have utterly failed to crush the freedom sentiments of the Kashmiri people. Minhas demanded the immediate release of all illegally detained Hurriyat leaders, including APHC Chairman Masarrat Aalam Butt, Shabbir Ahmad Shah, Muhammad Yasin Malik, Aasiya Andrabi, Naheeda Nasreen, Fehmeeda Sofi, Nayeem Ahmad Khan, Ayaz Muhammad Akbar, Shahid-ul-Islam, Merajuddin Kalwal, Peer Saifullah, Farooq Ahmad Dar, Fehmeeda Sofi, Naheeda Nasreen, Mushtaq-ul-Islam, Molvi Bashir Ahmad Irfani, Bilal Siddiqi, Amir Hamza, and thousands of other Kashmiri youth and activists languishing in Indian jails. The APHC spokesman reaffirmed that the people of Kashmir would continue their just struggle for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute. He stressed that it is high time for the Indian government to abandon its repressive and inflexible policies and take meaningful steps toward a peaceful and just settlement of the lingering Kashmir dispute.",
