    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): Nutrition International, in collaboration with TechnoServe, officially launched the Millers for Nutrition initiative in Pakistan on Tuesday. The initiative brings together key food fortification stakeholders to improve the nutritional quality of staple foods such as wheat flour and edible oil, aiming to combat micronutrient deficiencies and support national health goals. Millers for Nutrition is a global initiative that advances the vital role of millers in reducing malnutrition and improving public health through food fortification - a practice of adding essential micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to commonly consumed food to improve its nutritional value. The coalition aims to ensure access to quality fortified staple food for one billion people worldwide by 2026. Taking forward the global initiative in Pakistan, Nutrition International will engage wheat flour and edible oil millers, empowering them through targeted capacity building, provision of testing equipment and premixes, and support through strong partnerships with the government and industry. This will be complemented by celebrating and recognizing industry champions and promoting women's leadership in large-scale food fortification. \"The Millers for Nutrition Coalition is an important step that will advance the nutrition agenda in Pakistan,\" said Badaruddin Kakar, Central Chairman of Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA). \"Along with a strong regulatory environment, raising consumer awareness is equally vital so people can make healthier choices in staple foods. He said that PFMA is committed to working closely with Nutrition International and other partners to take this initiative forward for the lasting benefit of our people and the country's future. \"We are fully committed to achieving and sustaining 100% fortification of edible oil with Vitamins A and D,\" said Shaikh Abdul Razzaq, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association (PVMA). \"This is vital to safeguarding the health of our children and future generations. I urge oil millers across Pakistan to actively participate in this important initiative, and PVMA remains fully cooperative with Nutrition International and regulatory authorities to accelerate this progress.\" Large-scale food fortification has the potential to help individuals achieve optimal growth, maintain health, and improve their lifelong earning potential,\" said Dr. Shabina Raza, Country Director, Pakistan, Nutrition International, while speaking at the launch event. \"Micronutrient deficiencies remain a major public health challenge in Pakistan. The Millers for Nutrition initiative is a critical step forward, complementing Nutrition International's ongoing efforts to strengthen food fortification and expand access to essential nutrition for millions,\" she added. \"We are thrilled to introduce Millers for Nutrition in Pakistan,\" said Rizwan Yusufali, Global Program Director, TechnoServe. \"We want to unite passionate stakeholders to support Pakistan's Millers and food processors in achieving fortification excellence and driving meaningful change in the battle against malnutrition. Together, we can transform the future of nutrition in Pakistan\". The national launch event held in Islamabad brought together public and private sector leaders, including millers and representatives from the Pakistan Flour Mills and the Pakistan Vanaspati Associations, to strengthen partnerships and commit to action. Other speakers said that Millers for Nutrition initiative is a vital step in advancing Pakistan's national goals on food fortification. They said that this initiative connects millers with strategic fortification partners who are industry experts, suppliers, social enterprises, and other solution providers to access best-in-class technical assistance and specialized training on industry's best practices. According to them, such support from partners not only improves the nutritional quality of food products but also increases operational efficiencies and competitiveness of the businesses. They said by engaging millers, the initiative aids in strengthening industry practices and aligning them with the country's efforts toward food fortification as a strategy to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and improve nutrition outcomes.",
