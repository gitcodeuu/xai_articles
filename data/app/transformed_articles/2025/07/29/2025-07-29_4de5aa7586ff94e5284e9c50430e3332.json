    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Tuesday praised Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal (PBM) for organising a seminar on cancer prevention, calling it an important step toward spreading awareness about life-threatening diseases. Speaking at the event, he commended PBM Managing Director Shaheen Khalid Butt and his team for their commitment to serving vulnerable communities and providing much-needed support. The minister said that preventing diseases like cancer and ensuring access to treatment is a shared responsibility. \"It is heartbreaking when someone battling a fatal illness also lacks the resources for proper care,\" he noted. He stressed that the state is responsible for providing essential services, including healthcare and education, and assured that the current government is committed to fulfilling this duty. Referring to the vision of PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, Dr. Tariq Fazal said Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal was established to assist low- and middle-income families by offering medical and other support services. He added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is working hard to build a welfare state in line with this vision. Appreciating PBM's work in remote areas, he said the organisation is doing its best despite limited resources. He expressed confidence that the government will continue to strengthen PBM to further extend its services to labourers, students, and other underprivileged groups across the country.",
