    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): Vice President of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Senator Sherry Rehman, has strongly condemned the Modi government's ongoing campaign of lies, repression, and diplomatic misfires-this time following a scathing diplomatic blow from the United States. \"The Modi government's lies are now being exposed not only by the Indian opposition but also by its global partners. The world is no longer buying New Delhi's narrative,\" said Senator Rehman. Her remarks come in the wake of a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump addressed to Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, General Counsel for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), in which Trump reaffirmed his commitment to protecting American values, civil liberties, and citizens' rights. The letter, dated July 24 and bearing the official White House seal, was shared by Pannun on X, just weeks ahead of the Khalistan Referendum scheduled for August 17 in Washington, DC. \"Trump's letter is not just a piece of paper-it is a diplomatic slap and a loud alarm bell of global mistrust,\" Rehman stated. \"It clearly signals that the international community is taking serious note of India's cross-border repression and crackdown on dissenting voices, including those within the Sikh diaspora.\" The letter also follows the failed 2023 assassination attempt on Pannun, which U.S. authorities linked directly to India's intelligence agency, RAW. The foiled plot led to the arrest and indictment of Indian national Nikhil Gupta in the United States-further deepening mistrust between the two nations. Referring to the letter's contents, Senator Rehman noted that Trump affirmed, \"My Administration puts our citizens, our values, and our Nation FIRST... ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity worldwide.\" The letter goes on to outline Trump's Executive Order on his first day in office, mandating the State Department to prioritize American interests and instituting a 90-day freeze on foreign aid to reassess its impact. \"This is not just a personal blow to Modi, but a direct indictment of India's foreign policy failures. Even allies like the U.S. are distancing themselves,\" said Senator Rehman. In her earlier remarks, Senator Rehman also praised the Indian opposition for breaking ranks with Modi's propaganda. \"Even the Indian Parliament is now speaking the truth. The government's military failures are under scrutiny at home, and the collapse of its pride-symbolized by the Rafale crash-is plain for all to see,\" she said. Senator Rehman concluded by highlighting the growing credibility of the Khalistan movement and the international community's awakening to India's crackdown on free speech, religious tolerance, and minority rights. \"Modi's India has even angered the United States. This is the loudest testimony to New Delhi's diplomatic failures. The world is no longer silent.\"",
