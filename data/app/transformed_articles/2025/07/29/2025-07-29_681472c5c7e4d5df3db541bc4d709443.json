    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):Ethiopia's Ambassador to Pakistan, Jemal Beker Abdula, met with Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, on Tuesday to discuss joint initiatives in city planning, environmental conservation, and people-to-people exchanges. Held at the CDA Headquarters, the meeting focused on enhancing collaboration between the two capitals, with proposals ranging from a shared afforestation campaign to a formal sister-city partnership between Islamabad and Addis Ababa. Both sides emphasized the importance of urban sustainability and ecological restoration in response to growing climate and infrastructure challenges. During the meeting, Ambassador Beker suggested Ethiopian participation in Islamabad's Margalla Hills plantation drive, drawing parallels with Ethiopia's successful Green Corridor Project in Addis Ababa. In response, Chairman Randhawa welcomed the initiative and announced that land would be allocated in Islamabad to establish an \"Ethiopia-Pakistan Fraternity Park\" under the banner of Ethiopia's Green Legacy Initiative. \"Islamabad's transformation into a green, modern capital city is a shared goal, and Ethiopia's expertise can add great value to our vision,\" said Chairman Randhawa. He highlighted CDA's ongoing projects, including the rehabilitation of water channels, development of public eco-parks, and a broader focus on sustainable infrastructure. The two officials also discussed the potential for institutional collaboration in smart city solutions, riverbank rehabilitation, and urban innovation. Ambassador Beker expressed Ethiopia's desire to learn from Pakistan's experience in capital city governance and lauded CDA's achievements in making Islamabad one of the most livable and scenic cities in the region. \"CDA's work under Chairman Randhawa's leadership is impressive,\" Ambassador Beker remarked, adding that Ethiopia is eager to enhance ties in urban development, environmental management, and cultural exchange. A key highlight of the meeting was the proposal to establish a sister-city relationship between Islamabad and Addis Ababa. The initiative aims to strengthen diplomatic, cultural, and technical ties between the two nations through sustained cooperation in urban planning and community-led green projects. Both sides agreed to pursue further engagement through institutional linkages and technical exchanges, signaling a new phase of environmental diplomacy and development-focused collaboration between Ethiopia and Pakistan.",
