    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): Prime Minister's Coordinator on Information and Broadcasting on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, appreciated the Deputy Prime Minister (DPM)/ Foreign Minister (FM) of Pakistan, Senator Ishaq Dar's firm stance in the support of Palestine, hailing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) for shaping the foreign policies of the country in line with national values. In a post on X Tuesday, Ikhtiar Wali remarked that DPM/FM Ishaq Dar, during his recent visit to United States (US), clearly refused to recognize Israel and at the same time demanded United Nations (UN) membership for Palestine. It further stated that this is what we expected from the leadership of the PML-N, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Your workers and the people of Pakistan are proud of you.",
