    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) while condemning the killing of three youth in a fake encounter in Srinagar and atrocities on people living in upper reaches of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir has said that India's stubbornness is the biggest obstacle in resolving the Kashmir dispute. APHC spokesman Advocate Abdul Rashid Minhas in a statement in Srinagar expressing serious concern over the grave human rights violations including killing of three youth and injuring several Gujjar Bakarwal community members in upper reach of Srinagar by Indian forces called upon the world community to take cognizance of the grim situation in the territory. He said India through killings, arrests and other oppressive tactics cannot stop the Kashmiri people from carrying forward their struggle for right to self-determination. He condemned the continued illegal detention of Hurriyat leaders and activists and urged the world human rights organizations to play their role for the release of these detainees. The statement while appealing the people to observe August 5, the Youm-e-Istehsal-e-Kashmir, as a black day has deplored that India had invaded Jammu and Kashmir and illegally occupied it against the will of the Kashmiri people on October 27 in 1947 and it again repealed the special status of the territory and forcibly merged it with the Indian Union on August 5, 2019. The APHC maintained that the Kashmir dispute, which poses a serious threat to the peace of South Asia, can be resolved by implementing the relevant UN resolutions. He appealed to the international community to play its role in settling this lingering dispute in accordance with the Kashmiris' aspirations.",
