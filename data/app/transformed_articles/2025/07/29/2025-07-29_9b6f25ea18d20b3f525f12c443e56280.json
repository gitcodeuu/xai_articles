    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): Pakistan is set to dispatch 200 tons of humanitarian assistance for Palestinians via chartered cargo flights routed through Jordan and Egypt, following directives from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The Prime Minister has assigned Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik, Chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), to arrange two chartered aircraft-each carrying 100 tons of essential supplies-within the next two days. The aid includes urgently needed rations and sustenance items for communities in distress. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, alongside senior NDMA officials, will oversee the departure of the flights from Islamabad. Pakistan's ambassadors in Jordan and Egypt will facilitate receipt and onward distribution to the West Bank and other affected Palestinian areas.
