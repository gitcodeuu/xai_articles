    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reaffirmed Pakistan's firm commitment to eradicating human trafficking and protecting vulnerable citizens from exploitation. In his message, on the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, the prime minister highlighted that the day is observed globally each year not only to raise awareness about the heinous crime of human trafficking but also to expose its root causes and devastating consequences. This year's theme, \"Human Trafficking is an Organized Crime - End Exploitation,\" reflects the transnational and systemic nature of this global issue. \"Criminal networks around the world continue to exploit desperate individuals searching for livelihood opportunities, using trafficking as a tool for organized exploitation,\" said Prime Minister Sharif. \"Tragically, in recent years, Pakistan has witnessed heart-wrenching incidents where citizens attempting to migrate illegally have lost their lives at sea. These events have exposed the brutal reality of human trafficking,\" he added. In response to this growing menace, the federal government established a special task force to tackle the issue head-on. The Prime Minister praised the task force for working diligently to identify and counter the causes and consequences of this crime. He also acknowledged the commendable role played by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) in disrupting trafficking networks and holding complicit officials accountable. He further emphasized the government's proactive efforts in educating the public about legal overseas employment opportunities and ensuring the creation of viable economic pathways for citizens, both domestically and abroad. \"While the desire for a better future is natural, choosing illegal or misleading routes not only puts lives at risk but also constitutes a violation of national and international laws,\" he warned. PM Shehbaz Sharif noted that Pakistan actively participates in several international initiatives to combat trafficking, including the Budapest Process, Bali Process, Silk Route Partnership, and STARSOM (which spans Africa and the Americas). \"Through these forums, Pakistan continues to strengthen regional cooperation and collective efforts to safeguard economically vulnerable communities,\" he said. The Prime Minister concluded by calling for renewed national resolve. \"Today is a reminder for the federal and provincial governments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence institutions to continue working together with dedication. Pakistan remains firmly committed to playing an active and effective role in combating this inhumane crime at both the national and global levels.\"",
