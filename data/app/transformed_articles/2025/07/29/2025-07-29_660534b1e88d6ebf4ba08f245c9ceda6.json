    "article_body": "NEW YORK, Jul 28 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar Monday said Pakistan reaffirmed its unwavering and principled support for the Palestinian peoples' inalienable right to a viable, independent and contiguous state of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al Sharif as its capital. He was speaking at the United Nations High-Level International Conference on \"The Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution\" in New York. He said, \"For over 75 years the Palestinian people have endured occupation, displacement and denial of their fundamental rights including their inalienable right to self-determination.\" \"This prolonged injustice is not just a political failure but a moral stain and a persistent threat to international peace and security,\" he said adding, \"Today Gaza is a graveyard of international law and humanitarian principles.\" He said the death and destruction inflicted by Israel including the killing of over 58,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children was an unconscionable breach of international humanitarian law, the United Nations resolutions and the binding measures of the International Court of Justice. Blockade of aid, deliberate targetting of civilian infrastructure including refugee camps, hospitals and aid convoys crossed every red line of legality and humanity, he asserted. He said, \"The collective punishment of Palestinians must stop now and we must immediatetly act with purpose.\" \"It is high time for credible and enforcible international action on key priorities.\" He called for an unconditional, immediate and permanent ceasefire across Gaza and all Palestinian Occupied territories and implementation of the UN resolution 2735. He commended the efforts of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United States on the Palestinian issue. He urged full and unimpeded humanitarian access especially of life saving food and medicines to Gaza and the protection of humanitarian teams. He underlined the need for the financial and political support for UNRWA - a lifeline for millions of Palestinians. He called for international accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity and end of impunity for Israel. He said a genuine and irreversible political process should be undertaken to end the occupation of Palestine. \"The Palestinian question is the test case for the United Nations and the world,\" he said adding the conference must deliver actionable commitments including reaffirming the centrality of the two state solution which was the only path to sustainable peace. Outlining the aims of the conference, the Deputy Prime Minister said the international community must demand Israel's immediate withdrawal from Gaza. Gaza should be reconstructed as envisaged in resolution 2735 and the OIC Arab plan, he said adding the international community should support the OIC proposal to provide international protection to the Palestinian people through the deployment of a protection mechanism besides providing a timeline for building Palestinian institutional capacity and sovereignty. He said the conference participants must reject and halt any attempts to the forced displacement and demographic manipulation in Palestine. The international community must oppose illegal Israeli settlements and annexations especially in West Bank and East Jerusalem, he emphasised. \"We unequivocally condemn the Israeli Parliament's attempt to assert sovereignty over the Occupied West Bank.\" He called on the countries attending the conference to ensure the recognition of the state of Palestine and its full UN membership. \"We welcome France's decision to recognize the state of Palestine and encourage other countries who have not done so far, to extend recognition and contribute to this global momentum for Palestinian statehood,\" he remarked. Ishaq Dar said Pakistan stood ready to extend dedicated technical assistance and capacity building support towards Palestinian brothers and sisters in key sectors such as health, public administration, education and service delivery in accordance with the Palestinian leadership's decision. \"Pakistan is also prepared to contribute to the building of institutions including through participation in the OIC Arab plan or any international protection mechanism,\" he added. \"Let me conclude by saying that justice delayed is justice denied. But when justice is denied for generations, the consequences are even graver. The question of Palestine has impacted the entire region and beyond. We must give hope to the Palestinian people,\" he said adding, \" The occupation must end, and end now. It is time for freedom, self-determination and statehood, and Palestine's full membership of the UN. That will be the best guarantee for lasting peace in the region.\"",
