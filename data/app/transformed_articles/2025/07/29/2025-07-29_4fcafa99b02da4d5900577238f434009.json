    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has announced an ambitious plan to upgrade Islamabad's Diplomatic Enclave, aiming to enhance security, improve infrastructure, and introduce new recreational and commercial facilities in the highly sensitive zone that hosts foreign embassies and missions. The announcement came during a high-level meeting chaired by CDA Chairman and Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa at the CDA Headquarters on Tuesday. The session brought together senior board members, including Member Administration Talat Mahmood, Member Planning Dr. Khalid Hafeez, Member Engineering Syed Nafasat Raza, and Member Environment Asfandyar Baloch, along with other top officials. Following directions from Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the CDA reviewed detailed proposals for the enclave's development. The plan includes the construction of a modern shopping and sports complex, the upgrading of internal roads, the installation of smart lighting systems, enhanced landscaping, and improved security through integration with the Safe City surveillance network. \"Our goal is to transform the Diplomatic Enclave into one of the most secure, organized, and visually appealing areas of the capital,\" said Randhawa. \"We are using all available resources to ensure that the development reflects international standards.\" As part of the project, the entry and exit gates of the enclave will be redesigned and fitted with advanced surveillance systems. CCTV cameras will be installed at key checkpoints, with all monitoring linked to the Safe City system to ensure real-time security oversight. The enclave will also undergo significant beautification, with expanded green spaces, new tree plantations, and modern landscaping efforts aimed at creating an eco-friendly environment. To promote healthy lifestyles, the CDA plans to build cycling tracks and designate space for a new sports complex. Additionally, a multi-purpose event hall, food courts, and kiosks will be established to provide enhanced amenities for both residents and visitors. The CDA chairman emphasized the need for efficient and timely implementation, directing all departments to accelerate work without compromising quality. \"Timely execution and adherence to high construction standards are essential,\" Randhawa stated. He also underscored the enclave's symbolic importance, describing it as a reflection of Pakistan's national image. \"Upgrading the Diplomatic Enclave will not only improve daily operations for foreign missions but also elevate Islamabad's status as a modern and welcoming capital,\" he added. The Diplomatic Enclave, home to dozens of foreign embassies and consulates, is one of Islamabad's most secure and strategically important zones. The proposed developments are expected to enhance functionality, improve the visitor experience, and reinforce Pakistan's commitment to providing a safe, efficient, and world-class diplomatic environment.",
