    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday clubbed an appeal of Komal Ismail, a woman who allegedly honey-trapped blasphemy accused, seeking to quash an order against her with other relevant appeals. A division bench comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Azam Khan heard the intra-court appeal of woman and ordered to club it with other appeals. The court said that all we can do in this appeal is to mark the attendance of Komal Ismail. During the hearing, Komal Ismail's lawyer said that his client was not a party in the case but her identity card was blocked and her name was included in the ECL. Justice Soomro said that in the order, Komal Ismail has been asked to appear before the investigating officer. What is the harm if she appears. This division bench has suspended the last order of the single bench dated July 15. The single bench had accepted the main plea in the last order, so we suspended it. The court said that Komal Ismail's case is under investigation, we will not interfere in it. Petitioner's lawyer said that when Komal Ismail came to know about the summons, the final order of the single bench had already been made. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro said, \"We are not satisfied. We will not even touch the interim order.\" The main plea was accepted in the final order of the single bench, so it was suspended. That order was suspended because a commission cannot be formed later on cases in which decisions, sentences or acquittals have been made. The reason for the suspension of the order is that a High Court judge formed a commission on cases of the whole of Pakistan outside his jurisdiction. He remarked that if final decisions and sentences have been made in the cases, a commission cannot be formed. Here, the single bench has clearly written that Komal was involved in the murder case and we will not interfere. The court directed that the case be joined with the already pending intra-court appeals and adjourned the hearing.",
