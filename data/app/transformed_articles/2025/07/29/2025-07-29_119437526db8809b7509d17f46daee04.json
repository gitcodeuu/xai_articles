    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration has intensified its efforts to regulate the price of essential commodities, with a particular focus on sugar. In the last 24 hours, two retail shops were sealed, 19 shopkeepers were taken into custody, and fines amounting to Rs 66,500 were imposed on violators selling sugar above the officially fixed rate. The enforcement operations were carried out under the supervision of price control magistrates in various markets and sectors of the city. According to the spokesman of ICT administration, the actions are part of a broader campaign to ensure the availability of sugar at government-notified prices and to discourage profiteering. During the crackdown, several shopkeepers were found charging more than the approved per kilogram rate for sugar. After on-the-spot inspections, the authorities took legal action, including sealing shops and detaining those found guilty of price manipulation. The administration stated that the campaign will continue without any pause, and daily monitoring of prices will be ensured through regular field visits by magistrates. Areas with repeated violations will face stricter actions, including extended sealing of shops and higher penalties. In addition to enforcing fines, the administration has also issued a public appeal, urging citizens to report any violations related to sugar pricing. Residents have been asked to cooperate by informing the relevant authorities whenever they find a vendor overcharging. Complaints can be registered through the district administration's helpline or official complaint platforms. Officials said that strict implementation of price control measures is necessary to protect consumers, especially in the current economic climate. They reiterated that action against violators will be swift and without discrimination. All retailers are bound to display price lists in a visible place at their shops and adhere strictly to the rates set by the government. The administration further warned wholesalers and retailers against hoarding or manipulating supply chains to artificially inflate prices. Raids may also be conducted at godowns and supply points if irregularities are suspected. Shopkeepers and traders' associations have been advised to cooperate with the administration. A number of trader representatives have reportedly assured authorities of their support in stabilising prices and discouraging profiteering practices. A spokesman said that enforcement drives will cover all sectors, from main markets to small neighbourhood shops. The administration is also reviewing the current supply and demand situation to ensure that price controls do not lead to shortages. Officials stressed the importance of fair trade practices and warned that those exploiting market conditions for undue profit will face consequences under relevant laws. Citizens are encouraged to participate in the campaign by keeping receipts of their purchases and lodging complaints in case of any discrepancies. Photos, videos, and location details can help authorities take timely action. The ongoing operation is part of a wider effort to regulate the prices of essential food items, including flour, ghee, rice, and pulses. However, sugar remains a priority due to its frequent price fluctuations and its wide use in households. So far, the administration claims that the visible presence of enforcement teams and the imposition of fines have served as a deterrent in many markets. The crackdown is likely to continue over the next few weeks until complete price compliance is achieved. Through this drive, the administration aims to send a clear message that price violations will not be tolerated and that protecting consumer rights remains a top priority for local authorities.",
