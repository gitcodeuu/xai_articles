In the meeting held on the sidelines of the International Conference on Two-State Solution at the United Nations, they also discussed close collaboration at multilateral fora, including at the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Both sides agreed to undertake high-level exchanges in the near future to deepen bilateral engagement. Expressing deep concern at continuing Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, the two ministers underscored the urgent need for a just and lasting resolution.
