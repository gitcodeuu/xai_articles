    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): A recent session of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), chaired by MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, uncovered serious irregularities in the use of public funds and raised alarm over the worsening sugar crisis in the country. The meeting turned tense as lawmakers questioned top officials from the Ministry of Information, the Ministry of Industries, and other key departments. Audit officials informed the committee that the Press Information Department (PID) was given a special supplementary grant of Rs 1.95 billion for a flood awareness campaign. However, only Rs 150 million of this amount was actually spent on the campaign. The remaining funds were diverted to other purposes. The auditors pointed out that the funds were approved solely for the flood campaign and using them elsewhere was a violation of financial rules. In response, the Secretary of Information stated that the ministry did not request the funds exclusively for flood-related use. During the same session, concern was raised over the financial condition of the state-run Pakistan Television (PTV), where employees have not been paid for months. Lawmakers, including Shazia Marri and Shahida Akhtar Ali, expressed deep concern over the matter and called for an immediate investigation. The issue was handed over to a subcommittee for further examination. Another sensitive topic discussed was the operational status of Bol News. Questions were raised by Syed Aminul Haque about how the channel was functioning without official security clearance. Government officials responded that the matter was currently under a stay order from the Sindh High Court and therefore sub-judice. The committee also turned its focus to the ongoing sugar crisis. The Secretary for Industries and Production briefed members that Pakistan had a sugar surplus of 1.3 million tons in 2023-24. Of this, 790,000 tons were approved for export. He said that 1.9 million tons of sugar is still available in stock, which could last until November, and that the sugar crushing season runs from November 15 to March 15. Despite these figures, several committee members expressed dissatisfaction with the situation. The Secretary for National Food Security claimed that the average retail price of sugar was Rs 173 per kilogram, but members, including Umar Ayub, said sugar was being sold for more than Rs 200 in their constituencies. Senator Fauzia Arshad reported that sugar was nearly unavailable in the market and what was available was unaffordable for ordinary citizens. PAC members heavily criticized the government's inconsistent sugar policies-exporting sugar one year and importing it the next. MNA Khawaja Shehraz Mehmood called it a \"daylight robbery\" and said that the same companies making huge profits from exports are now benefiting from imports. MNA Malik Amir Dogar made direct allegations against political leaders, claiming that the highest number of sugar mills are owned by former president Asif Ali Zardari, politician Jahangir Tareen, and the Sharif family. He alleged that Rs 287 billion had gone into the pockets of a few powerful individuals. The remarks caused heated arguments between Dogar and other members, including Senator Afnan Ullah and Shazia Marri, who demanded that such serious claims be backed with evidence. Further tension arose when Chairman Junaid Akbar questioned why the list of sugar mill owners and directors had not been submitted to the committee earlier. Officials from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) assured that the list has now been obtained and will be presented soon. He also questioned how long sugar remains usable in storage, to which the Secretary of Industries responded that sugar begins to spoil after three to four months unless special precautions are taken. The meeting concluded with the revelation that Pakistan is planning to import 300,000 tons of sugar to meet demand before the next crushing season begins. Lawmakers demanded that the government ensure this import does not harm local farmers and that sugar is not brought in from countries where it was previously exported. The PAC directed all relevant ministries to submit detailed reports and warned that future briefings would not be accepted without complete documentation. The session highlighted the urgent need for transparency, accountability, and better coordination in economic policymaking.",
