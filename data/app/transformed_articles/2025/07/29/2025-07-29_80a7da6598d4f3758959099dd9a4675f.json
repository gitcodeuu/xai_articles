    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) has officially announced the closure of its summer session due to limited time and directed all students to vacate the hostels for necessary repair and maintenance work. The decision was made in meetings of the university's Deans, Chairpersons and Directors on July 8 and 16, under the leadership of Acting Vice Chancellor Prof Zafar Nawaz Jaspal. These decisions were later approved by Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Niaz Ahmad Akhtar in a high-level meeting held on July 25, after he resumed office. On Tuesday morning, Prof Dr Niaz Ahmad personally supervised a major hostel clean-up operation, winning praise from the Academic Staff Association (ASA). ASA President Prof Mazhar Iqbal appreciated the Vice Chancellor's commitment and hands-on leadership in improving the university environment. ASA also thanked the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training, Islamabad Administration, Provost Boys Hostel, Director of Students Affairs, Resident Officer, hostel staff, and the university's security personnel for supporting the clean-up drive. The ASA gave special credit to Prof Zafar Nawaz Jaspal for his strong and principled leadership during the transitional period. ASA reaffirmed its commitment to raising key issues affecting the university and called for strict enforcement of rules to maintain peace, stability, and discipline on campus.",
