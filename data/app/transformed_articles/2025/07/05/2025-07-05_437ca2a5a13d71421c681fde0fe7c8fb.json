    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 5 (APP): Chairman of PIYYAS International Human Rights, Rana Imran Latif, expressed deep concern over the increasingly organized activities of professional begging groups across the country, particularly in urban centers. In a statement issued by his office on Saturday, he highlighted several instances where children were forcibly made to beg. He further highlighted disturbing reports suggesting that abducted or abandoned children are deliberately harmed or mutilated to force them into permanent disability, subsequently used for begging on the streets an act that severely violates their fundamental human rights. Drawing the government's attention to this matter, Rana Imran Latif stated that \"This is a deeply sensitive humanitarian issue that requires a joint response from the state, society, and welfare institutions through a coordinated strategy.\" The Chairman lauded the Anti-Beggary Amendment Bill recently introduced by the Punjab Government, describing it as a welcome step, and added that \"Declaring forced begging a non-bailable offense and prescribing strict punishments for those involved is a significant development. We hope similar legislation will soon be introduced in Islamabad and other provinces.\"",
