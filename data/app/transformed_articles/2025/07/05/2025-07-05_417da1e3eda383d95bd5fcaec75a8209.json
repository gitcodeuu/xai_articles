    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 05 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA), Muhammad Ali Randhawa paid a surprise visit to Markazi Imam Bargah Asna Ashri in G-6 on Saturday to ensure seamless security arrangements for 9th Muharram processions. Accompanied by senior officials including the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Director Generals of Islamabad Water, Emergency and Disaster Management, the Assistant Commissioner of the area, and representatives from CDA, district administration, and police, the Chairman was briefed on the comprehensive security plan put in place. The security blueprint, designed under the leadership of Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, has been implemented in close consultation with the management of Imam Bargah Asna Ashri, officials confirmed. Speaking on the occasion IGP Islamabad said \"Foolproof arrangements have been made and are being executed in letter and spirit,\" adding that the procession began on time, and the route has been fully cleared with heavy police deployment ensuring peace and safety. Muhammad Ali Randhawa, who also serves as Chief Commissioner and DG Civil Defence, emphasized his commitment to personally monitor all Muharram processions across Islamabad. \"All wings of the police and administration have been directed to remain on high alert and ensure the best possible security measures,\" he stated. In addition to law enforcement, departments responsible for sanitation, drainage, water supply, and emergency response-including teams from CDA, Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), and the District Municipal Administration (DMA)-have been mobilized to remain stationed along the route of the 9th Muharram procession. Officials confirmed that surveillance through Safe City CCTV cameras has been activated to maintain strict monitoring throughout the event. Randhawa further directed all relevant civic and administrative units to maintain full coordination for the peaceful and smooth conduct of processions. The 9th and 10th of Muharram mark significant religious observances for the Shia community, and the government has ramped up efforts in recent years to ensure both security and facilitation during the commemorations in Islamabad.",
