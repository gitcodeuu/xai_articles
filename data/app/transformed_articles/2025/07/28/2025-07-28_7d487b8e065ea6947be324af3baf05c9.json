    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):: In cities across Pakistan, it's now a familiar sight, educated young men and women, dressed neatly, CVs in hand, going office to office in search of a job. They hold degrees, some even postgraduate, yet face closed doors. This is no longer just a personal struggle; it's a national crisis. A 2024 report by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) revealed that over 31% of young graduates are unemployed. Surprisingly, those with advanced degrees are often the worst hit. The core of this growing issue is credential inflation, when too many people hold similar qualifications, reducing their value in the job market. Where a bachelor's or master's once opened doors, today it's just the starting point. Employers now look beyond degrees, expecting practical experience, soft skills, and digital literacy, gaps many universities fail to address. \"Having a degree is not enough to get a good job,\" said Amna Younas, a BS Mass Communication student, talking to APP. \"We study for years, mostly from books, but don't get enough practical experience. Companies now want hands-on skills rather than just theory.\" The shift is pushing students toward short, skill-based online courses that are more job-specific and affordable. This new hiring trend leaves traditional graduates at a disadvantage. \"I've just completed my degree and thought it would be the beginning of something big,\" said Shaista Gul, a recent graduate from Quaid-e-Azam University. \"But there are hardly any job opportunities, even internships. Employers want experience, skills, and certifications. A degree alone doesn't make you stand out anymore, it just makes you part of the crowd.\" Mussarat Shazia, a school teacher, shared her concern as a parent with APP and said, \"Earlier, a degree meant hard work. Now, it feels like just a piece of paper. Our children study for years, but they don't get the chances they deserve.\" Amna Bibi, who holds an MSc in Economics, added, \"Credential inflation has made it harder to stand out. Entry-level jobs now demand qualifications that were once needed for senior roles. This forces people to keep collecting degrees rather than real experience.\" Muhammad Abdullah, a DAE Civil graduate,when asked by this scribe about credential inflation said, \"The degrees are losing value because the skills needed in the job market aren't taught properly in institutions. Now students are more aware and interested in practical learning instead of just theory.\" Employers echo these frustrations. They no longer view degrees as a guarantee of capability or meeting job standards. \"I look for practical skills, project management, and problem-solving ability,\" said Shehriyar Khalid, night shift in-charge and operations manager at TCS Rawalpindi. \"A degree is important, but not enough. Fresh thinking and application matter more.\" He advised students to learn skills. Afaq Anjum, Hiring Manager at Nexus Solutions, agreed: \"Experience, adaptability, and the ability to learn on the job matter more than academic titles. I value practical skills and a problem-solving mindset over multiple degrees.\" These voices highlight a system where effort and education don't translate into opportunity. The mismatch stems from outdated university curricula, a lack of internships, weak career counseling, and a job market that often rewards connections over merit. Degrees in Pakistan no longer guarantee success, not because students haven't worked hard, but because the system hasn't kept up. Credential inflation is not just about devalued education. It's about wasted potential, delayed futures, and lost hope. So who is responsible? It's a shared failure, of universities that haven't updated their teaching, of a government that hasn't built enough skill-building platforms, and of an industry that still leans on referrals over qualifications. But the crisis is fixable.One solution is to establish national internship institutions, where graduates receive six months of practical training, covering workplace tools, ethics, and real-world experience. Universities must also collaborate with industries to ensure students get exposure before they graduate. In many developed countries like Germany, Canada, and the UK, universities work closely with industries to bridge the gap between education and employment. Students are often hired during their final semesters through structured internship programs, co-op placements, and campus recruitment drives. These systems focus on practical training alongside academics, ensuring that by the time students graduate, they already have relevant experience - a model still largely missing in Pakistan's higher education system.",
