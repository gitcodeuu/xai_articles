    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):Information Secretary of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Mushtaq Ahmed Butt said that August 5 will be remembered as a very painful and tragic day in the history of the Kashmiri people. This is the day when the Modi government, violating all legal, moral and international boundaries, killed the state of Jammu and Kashmir and abolished the constitutional and special status of the state. Talking to APP here on Monday, he said that India not only abolished the constitutional identity of the state but also divided it into two parts and turned it into an open prison, where about one crore Kashmiris were deprived of their basic political, religious and social rights. This move was a clear violation not only of international laws but also of UN resolutions. Mushtaq Ahmed Butt said that since August 5, 2019, India has initiated such state repression and tyranny in occupied Kashmir that is rarely seen in the modern history of the world including hundreds of unarmed Kashmiris were extrajudicially killed, thousands were arrested and imprisoned in remote jails in India, hundreds of residential houses were demolished, dozens of Kashmiris were dismissed from government jobs and subjected to economic retaliation and freedom of expression was restricted to such an extent that fear and silence reigned in the entire valley. He said that India was carrying out a systematic attack on the identity, culture, identity and lands of Kashmiri Muslims in today's modern era. By issuing millions of domiciles and settling non-state people, the demographic structure of the state is being changed so that the Muslim majority character of the state can be changed into a minority. He made it clear that despite all these atrocities, intimidation, and political revenge, the Kashmiri people will not back down even an inch from their demand for their right to self-determination. The Hurriyat leadership and the Kashmiri nation are determined to achieve their fundamental right in accordance with the UN resolutions. Mushtaq Ahmed Butt strongly appealed to the UN, the European Union, the OIC, and international human rights organizations to, take immediate notice of these cruel measures by India, fulfill their legal, moral, and humanitarian duty to stop the ongoing human rights violations in Kashmir and apply global pressure and take practical steps to give the Kashmiris their right to self-determination. August 5 is not just a date, but a symbol of tyranny against which the Kashmiri people have raised the flag of resistance. No matter how severe the oppression, the light of truth defeats it. The Hurriyat leadership is with the Kashmiri people, and this struggle will continue until the goal is achieved, he added.",
