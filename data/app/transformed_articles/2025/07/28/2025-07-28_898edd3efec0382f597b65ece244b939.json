    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):The National Highway Authority (NHA) has initiated swift road restoration operations in the Northern Areas following severe weather disruptions, acting on special directives from Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan here on Monday. In his statement the Minster said that the Key highways, including the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (N-15) and Skardu-Jaglot Road, were blocked due to landslides and cloudbursts. NHA teams have cleared multiple obstruction points, ensuring partial restoration of traffic and improved accessibility for travelers. The 242-kilometer-long N-15, a critical route for tourism and regional connectivity, was blocked at various locations. According to officials, landslides along the route have been successfully cleared and restoration work is progressing on the stretch from Naran to Babusar Top and Chilas,he added. Federal Secretary Communications Ali Sher Mehsud and Chairman NHA are present on-site, personally overseeing the restoration activities. \"We are committed to restoring all major highways at the earliest,\" said the Secretary, confirming that travel towards Kaghan and Naran has now resumed. On the Skardu-Jaglot Road, NHA has managed to clear 20 out of 25 landslide-affected points. The remaining blockages are expected to be removed soon, with continuous efforts underway. A comprehensive progress report has been submitted to the Federal Minister. To maintain pace, NHA has placed all field officers on 24-hour alert, cancelled staff leave and activated its emergency response plan across Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy machinery remains operational across the region to tackle any further disruptions. Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan lauded the NHA's prompt response and emphasized that restoring safe mobility for the public remains the government's top priority.",
