    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP): A division bench of Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday served notices to respondents in a petition seeking quashing of the stay order on auction of Bahria Town's properties. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif heard the case. During the hearing on the NAB's miscellaneous petition, NAB Prosecutor Rafi Maqsood appeared in the court and took the position that the accused had entered into a plea bargain but due to non-payment of the amount, details of the properties were sought. NAB's notice to provide details of the properties was challenged in the trial court. After the petition was dismissed, the Islamabad High Court was approached and a stay was granted. The Chief Justice said that a similar petition was also filed in the Rawalpindi Bench of the Lahore High Court, to which the NAB prosecutor said that the Rawalpindi Bench told the petitioners to go before the auction committee. The lawyer tried to take the help of the Islamabad High Court's stay order but that was also rejected. The Chief Justice said that he is issuing a notice to the other party on the petition to hear their stance. The prosecutor said that NAB has advertised the auction of the properties on August 7, requesting that the stay order on the auction of the properties be lifted. The Chief Justice said that a date before August 7, is being set for the next hearing. If the other party does not appear at the next hearing, action will be taken according to the law. The court adjourned the hearing of the case until August 4.",
