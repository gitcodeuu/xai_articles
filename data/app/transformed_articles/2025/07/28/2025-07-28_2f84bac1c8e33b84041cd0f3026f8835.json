    "article_body": "ATTOCK, Jul 28 (APP):The police have arrested 11 individuals for violating Section 144 which prohibits bathing in rivers, streams, and canals amid the rising flood and rainfall risks in Punjab during the rainy season. According to details, the Punjab government has enforced Section 144 across the province to prevent drowning incidents during the ongoing monsoon and flood situation. However, a police patrol led by ASI Muhammad Arabi of Saddar Police Station observed several individuals bathing in the Harro River despite the official ban. The police reports stated that the men were loudly warned to stop, but they refused to comply and instead caused a public disturbance. The police team managed to apprehend them after strong resistance. The arrested individuals were identified as Muhammad Irfan , Haider, Mansoor Ali , Atif , Anwar and Bakhtiar , all residents of Dhok Fatah Attock City.
