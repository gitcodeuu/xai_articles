    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):A fresh spell of intense monsoon rains is forecast to hit northern Pakistan from July 28 to 31, posing risks of urban flooding, glacial surges and landslides across Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) and Chitral Valley, according to the latest advisory issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). In anticipation of these weather-driven hazards, NDMA has strongly advised residents in vulnerable areas to remain vigilant, avoid non-essential travel and strictly follow official guidance. For real-time alerts and safety protocols, citizens are encouraged to use the aPak NDMA Disaster Alerta mobile app and monitor updates from NDMA and local administration channels. NDMAas National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) has issued flood alerts for several areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK, urging timely preparedness amid worsening weather conditions. According to NEOC, rain is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh in AJK during the forecast period. These rains may lead to flooding, while heavy showers in hilly regions may also trigger landslides. In Chitral Valley, Buni and Reshun areas, rainfall combined with melting glaciers may result rise in the water flow of River Chitral. Urban flooding is also likely in Muzaffarabad and Bagh due to heavy downpours. NDMA has directed all relevant departments and agencies to take proactive measures, ensure the readiness of personnel, machinery, and rescue teams, and remain vigilant to deal with any emergency situation. Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs) and local administrations have been instructed to take timely preventive actions.",
