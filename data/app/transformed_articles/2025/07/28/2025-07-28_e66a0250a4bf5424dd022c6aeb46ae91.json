    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):The National Highway Authority (NHA) has successfully reopened the Kaghan, Naran, Babusar Top, and Chilas highways after a massive landslide clearance operation, restoring full access to the 242-kilometer-long N-15 route from Mansehra to Jalkhand. The operation was launched on the special instructions of Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan, following severe weather disruptions across northern Pakistan. Heavy monsoon rains and cloudbursts had caused widespread damage to road infrastructure, triggering landslides, mudslides, and the collapse of temporary bridges. The affected roads, popular among tourists and vital for regional connectivity, were swiftly cleared in a round-the-clock operation supervised by Federal Secretary Communications Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA Chairman Shehryar Sultan. \"All routes are now open for public and tourist traffic,\" the NHA confirmed to APP on Monday, adding that the Jaglot-Skardu road had already been restored earlier in the week. More than 20 major landslide points were cleared using heavy machinery, while emergency linkages and temporary bridges were rebuilt to restore continuity of transport. \"By the grace of Allah Almighty and with commendable teamwork, we were able to reopen these crucial routes under very challenging conditions,\" said Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud. \"Massive boulders, washed-out sections, and broken bridges made the operation extremely demanding. But under the guidance of the Federal Minister, over 90% of the road network was restored by Sunday and the remainder by Monday.\" Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan received regular updates throughout the effort and was presented with a final report confirming full restoration on Monday afternoon. In a bid to strengthen future preparedness, Chairman NHA Shehryar Sultan has directed the preparation of a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan and temporarily suspended all field officers' leaves to ensure uninterrupted presence on site during emergencies. The restoration of the N-15 route and associated highways brings relief to residents, businesses, and thousands of tourists who frequent the scenic northern areas during the summer months. With all major roadways now fully operational, authorities have urged travelers to remain cautious during ongoing monsoon conditions.",
