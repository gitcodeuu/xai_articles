    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):Federal Minister for Power Division and Energy Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari said that Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan trade and economic relations will continue to serve as a foundation of our bilateral partnership. However, it is a matter of concern that the bilateral trade volume has declined significantly, from USD 11.2 million in 2022-23 to USD 5.18 million in 2024.25. The minister said, \"We acknowledge the pressing need to revitalize our trade engagement and reaffirm our shared aspiration to elevate bilateral trade upto USD 100 million\". He was addressing at 5th Session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission and welcomed to the Baisalov Edil Zholdybaevich, the Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, honourable delegates from the Kyrgyz Republic and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. He said that Baisalov Edil Zholdybaevich and esteemed delegates to Islamabad for the 5th Session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to our Kyrgyz counterparts for their continued engagement and shared commitment to a prosperous and interconnected future for our two nations. Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical, and spiritual affinities. Since the formalization of our economic relationship in 1994, we have made notable progress across various sectors. This session marks yet another important milestone in our collective journey of strengthening and institutionalizing our bilateral partnership. Under the framework of this Commission, our cooperation has steadily expanded across a broad spectrum-ranging from trade and investment to tourism, agriculture, energy, science and technology and education. It is heartening to witness the growing momentum, despite the challenges that continue to affect global and regional economic landscapes. Achieving this goal will require consistent and collaborative efforts across multiple sectors. The revival of the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Joint Business Council (JBC), sustained B2B interactions, and the early finalization of key Memorandum of Understanding on Electronic Data Interchange between customs authorities, are essential steps forward. The minister said that \"We also take positive note of the inaugural meeting of the Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment, and now look ahead to expediting progress on the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Transit Trade Agreement, a key initiative aimed at enhancing regional connectivity and facilitating seamless cross-border trade. Signing of another Memorandum of Understanding and cooperation in Halal Trade is a step towards achieving our shared goals\". Investment remains a key area of priority and potential for both our countries. Positive steps have already been taken, including the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the National Investments Agency of Kyrgyzstan and the Board of Investment of Pakistan. This agreement provides a solid foundation for targeted engagement in high-potential sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, minerals, tourism, and information technology. Pakistan also appreciate Kyrgyzstan's offer of access to the At-Bashi Logistics Center for Pakistan's National Logistics Corporation (NLC), which stands as a commendable example of enterprise-level cooperation, and one that we also hope to replicate across other domains. To foster broader private sector participation, we encourage both sides to enhance the online visibility of investment opportunities by providing comprehensive and up-to-date information on Special Economic Zones (SEZs), tax incentives, and priority sectors. Tourism and cultural exchange serve as powerful conduits for deepening people-to-people connectivity. Both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan, endowed with stunning natural landscapes and rich cultural heritage, stand to gain significantly from closer collaboration in this domain. We look forward to finalizing the MoU on Tourism, Hospitality, and Investment, and to expanding the exchange of tour operators and tourism-related information, including active participation in international exhibitions. Likewise, the signing of Memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the field of Agriculture is a pivotal step towards promoting trade in Kyrgyz legumes and the export of Pakistan's Basmati rice, among other value-added food products. Enhanced collaboration on veterinary and phytosanitary controls will further facilitate safe and efficient food trade. Both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan share a vision of green and sustainable development. We are aligned on exploring Pakistan's participation in the proposed 500 kV Torugart-XUAR-Gilgit Baltistan transmission line, which would establish a strategic Kyrgyzstan-China-Pakistan electricity grid. We also welcome Kyrgyz interest in investing in Pakistan's mining sector, particularly in copper and gold exploration. Moreover, strengthening transport and communication infrastructure remains critical for the realization of our economic potential. We anticipate progress on the postal cooperation agreement, operationalization of cargo under the 1995 International Motor Transportation Agreement, and improvements in e-commerce connectivity. We are also encouraged by discussions on expanding air and rail links, including flight frequency increases. The financial sector serves as a vital engine for economic growth. We appreciate the mutual interest in enhancing interbank and financial cooperation, particularly in Islamic banking and financial innovation. The recent agreement between the State Bank of Pakistan and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic for joint training programs is a constructive step toward deepening institutional collaboration. The health sector also offers significant and strategic opportunities for advancing our bilateral cooperation. We remain optimistic about the early finalization of the MoU on Higher Medical Education, and commend Kyrgyzpharmacia for its engagement with Pakistani pharmaceutical firms, particularly in exploring the supply of Pakistani pharmaceutical products to the Kyrgyz Republic and potential joint ventures in vaccine production in collaboration with the National Institute of Health. We further underscore the importance of regulatory alignment and the need to streamline the registration process for Pakistani medicines in Kyrgyzstan, which will help ensure timely access and promote greater commercial collaboration in the health sector. The cultural sector serves as a vital bridge, fostering mutual understanding and enriching the shared heritage between our nations. It is essential that we translate these affinities into formal institutional mechanisms. The finalization of the Agreement on Culture, alongside the organization of joint cultural events, will significantly deepen people-to-people connections. Youth engagement also presents a dynamic platform for cultivating future leaders and strengthening the bonds of friendship between our peoples. Through conferences, seminars on youth policy issues, and the exchange of experiences, we can empower our younger generations to carry forward this partnership. Education forms the cornerstone of our partnership, serving as a catalyst for knowledge exchange and capacity building to advance sustainable development. Our efforts remain focused on collaboration in STEAM training, academic exchanges, and joint research initiatives. We reaffirm our commitment to supporting Kyrgyz students through the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme (PTAP) and encourage the strengthening of institutional partnerships between our universities. The minister said in his concluding remarks that the 5th Session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission offers us a renewed opportunity to transform our shared vision into enduring outcomes. Let us reaffirm our commitment to fostering a stronger, integrated, and resilient partnership, anchored in mutual respect, cooperation, and regional peace.",
