    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP): Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa Monday directed to accelerate development work in multiple sectors of Islamabad, reaffirming his commitment to making the federal capital a model city through high-quality infrastructure and public service delivery. Chairing a high-level meeting here, Randhawa reviewed the progress of ongoing projects in sectors C-14, C-15, C-16, E-12, and I-12. Senior CDA officials, including Member Administration and Estate Talat Mahmood, Member Engineering Syed Nafasat Raza, and Member Planning Dr. Khalid Hafiz, were in attendance. \"We must not only speed up development but also ensure that no compromise is made on quality and standards,\" Chairman Randhawa directed. He instructed the Deputy Commissioner CDA and other relevant directorates to establish camp offices on-site in active development areas, ensuring that public grievances are resolved at their doorstep in a transparent and lawful manner. Randhawa also announced plans to install modern lighting, improve road infrastructure, and widen main entry points across new sectors. He ordered the removal of all encroachments and illegal structures, and emphasized that all hurdles delaying progress must be eliminated immediately. In a significant boost to CDA's financial capacity, Chairman Randhawa applauded the recent record-breaking commercial plot auction, calling it a \"historic success\" and commending the performance of all relevant departments. He instructed the Finance Wing to allocate necessary funds to ensure timely completion of development projects. \"CDA is fully committed to transforming Islamabad into a model city,\" Randhawa said. \"We are using all available resources to meet the housing needs of our citizens efficiently and transparently.\"",
