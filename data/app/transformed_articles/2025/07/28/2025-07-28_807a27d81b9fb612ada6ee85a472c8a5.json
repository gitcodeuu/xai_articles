    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):Federal Minister for Health, Syed Mustafa Kamal has emphasized the urgent need for coordinated and effective measures to increase immunization coverage across the country. He was addressing the high-level meeting of the Federal Directorate of Immunization (FDI) which was organized to review the progress and challenges of Pakistan's immunization program. During the meeting, Dr. Soofia Yunus Director General EPI presented a comprehensive briefing on the current challenges faced by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) and outlined the strategic way forward. Minister Mustafa Kamal urged to ensure that all children are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. He announced that a new nationwide plan will be developed to launch an impactful immunization drive aimed at protecting children against 12 life-threatening diseases. He stressed that the goal of this awareness campaign is to ensure that parents understand the critical importance of timely vaccination and commit to safeguarding their children's health. \"Parents must not become enemies of their own children by ignoring vaccination,\" the Minister stated firmly. They must take their children to the nearest health center for routine immunization.\" Underscoring the government's commitment, he added, \"Prevention is better than cure. Our primary focus is on prevention, we must stop children from falling ill in the first place.\" The minister said that protecting children from deadly diseases is not only a public health priority but also a religious and moral responsibility of every parent.",
