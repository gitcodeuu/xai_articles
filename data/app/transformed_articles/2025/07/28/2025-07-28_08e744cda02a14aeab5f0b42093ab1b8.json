    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Monday hailed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as a visionary leader of the Muslim world, praising his unwavering commitment to global Muslim causes and the deep-rooted ties between Pakistan and Turkiye. Speaking at the launch ceremony of the book \"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Tiger of Islamic World' authored by Dr. Furqan Hameed, Minister Tarar paid tribute to President Erdogan's political journey-from his transformative tenure as Mayor of Istanbul to his leadership of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). He described Erdogan as a \"people's leader and an effective administrator,\" whose governance continues to inspire admiration across the Muslim Ummah. The Minister praised President Erdogan's grassroots leadership and his transformative tenure as Mayor of Istanbul. He highlighted Turkiye's historic bond with Pakistan and Erdogan's humanitarian efforts-especially during crises. Highlighting the flourishing Pak-Turk friendship, Tarar cited landmark collaborative projects such as the Lahore Metro Bus and the city's waste management initiative, developed during Shehbaz Sharif's tenure as Chief Minister of Punjab. He emphasized that bilateral ties between the two nations are built upon a history of mutual support and shared humanitarian values, dating back to the Khilafat Movement. Tarar noted the emotional bond between the citizens of both countries, recalling how Turkish people celebrated Pakistan's recent victory over India in the streets of Istanbul and Ankara. \"From natural disasters to moments of national pride, our people have stood together, united in empathy and joy,\" he said. The Minister praised Erdogan's strong voice on global Muslim issues-especially his outspoken advocacy for Palestine on platforms such as the United Nations, the D-8 Summit, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. He saluted Erdogan's powerful advocacy for Gaza across international platforms, calling him a global leader whose actions reflect deep moral commitment. He condemned the ongoing humanitarian blockade in Gaza, labeling it a \"catastrophic violation of basic human rights,\" and lauded Turkiye's swift response to refugee crises under Erdogan's direction. Tarar also recognized Pakistan's own efforts in providing humanitarian aid and educational opportunities for Palestinian students, reiterating the nation's commitment to justice and solidarity. \"Pakistan will continue to stand by Palestine through aid, advocacy, and prayer,\" he affirmed. Describing the Pak-Turk relationship as \"unbreakable,\" Tarar underscored its ideological foundation built on compassion, resilience, and mutual respect. He called President Erdogan the \"tiger of the world\"-a title earned through decades of dedicated leadership and global outreach-and praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vocal support for Palestine at international forums. Concluding his remarks, the Minister congratulated Dr. Furqan Hameed for his timely and heartfelt tribute to President Erdogan, reaffirming that Pakistan remains a peace-loving nation committed to regional integrity and international harmony. Speaking at the launch ceremony of his latest book, senior journalist and head of TRT Urdu Service, Dr. Furqan Hameed, lauded Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as an extraordinary statesman whose leadership has left an indelible mark not only on Turkiye but across the Muslim world. Dr. Hameed described President Erdogan's political journey as one rooted in public service, welfare-driven governance, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values. \"His struggle and vision are not merely chapters in Turkiye's history,\" he said, \"but a source of inspiration for the entire Muslim Ummah.\" Highlighting Turkiye's achievements under Erdogan's leadership, Dr. Hameed cited landmark progress in defense self-sufficiency, economic resilience, and democratic consolidation. He emphasized that Erdogan's influence transcends national borders, positioning him as a guiding force for Muslims globally. The author also underscored the deep spiritual and historical ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, noting that President Erdogan has cultivated a profound bond with both Pakistan's leadership and its people. \"His frequent references to Allama Iqbal's poetry reflect a heartfelt admiration and enduring affection for Pakistan,\" Dr. Hameed remarked. The ceremony served as a celebration of Pak-Turk friendship and a recognition of President Erdogan's role as a unifying figure in the Muslim world. The launch ceremony was graced by the distinguished presence of ambassadors from Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Rwanda, along with esteemed researcher Dr. Furqan Hamie, prominent journalists, and leading personalities from various walks of life.",
