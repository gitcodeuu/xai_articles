    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP): Speakers on Monday in a tribute to the legendary and revolutionary poet, Fahmida Riaz enunciated her as a dedicated scholar who through her poetry and writings highlighted that an egalitarian and progressive society can ensure social justice and inclusive development in our society. The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), in collaboration with the Ahmed Salim Study Centre, organized a thought-provoking seminar to honor the life, literary legacy, and political resistance of iconic poet, progressive writer, and activist Fahmida Riaz, said a press release. Titled \"A Tribute to Fahmida Riaz: A Voice of Resistance\", the event brought together eminent scholars, writers, poets, and journalists to reflect on her multifaceted contributions to literature, social justice, and democratic ideals. Moderated by Dr. Humera Ashfaq from Ahmed Salim Study Centre, the seminar opened with remarks from Dr. Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director SDPI, who emphasized that the initiative was part of the Ahmed Salim Study Centre's ongoing efforts to uphold the legacy of progressive voices in Pakistan. \"Fahmida Riaz was not just a poet but a social critic whose works foreshadowed modern development benchmarks such as gender inclusion and freedom of expression,\" he said. He also underlined the relevance of Riaz's work in the current context, especially in the wake of ongoing honour killings and other societal injustices. The session featured a visual and spoken-word display of Fahmida Riaz's poetry, offering a deep insight into the revolutionary content of her work. Dr. Suleri noted that Riaz, decades ago, had already highlighted issues like women's autonomy, honour-based violence, and the repression of democratic freedoms, subjects still urgent today. Dr. Shafqat Munir, Deputy Executive Director of SDPI, spoke of how Riaz's poetry provided moral and intellectual support to the National Students Federation (NSF) and other movements resisting General Zia-ul-Haq's regime. \"She was a visionary, her ideals on gender equality and freedom of thought were once branded as taboo, but now they are recognized as essential development goals,\" he stated. Saleem Khilji, Editor Publications at SDPI, recounted the grim censorship Fahmida Riaz faced under Zia's dictatorial rule. \"Her magazine Awaz was banned, and her reaction to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's execution, calling it a capital punishment for democracy, demonstrated her political insight and courage,\" he said. Khilji also praised Dr. Humera Ashfaq for reviving the legacy of the late Ahmed Salim. Joining online, Amar Sindhu, noted author and Assistant Professor, Sindh University, Jamshoro called Fahmida Riaz \"a soul forever tied to the land of Sindh,\" lauding her consistent connection between her thoughts and actions. \"There was never a disconnect between what she believed, wrote, and practiced,\" Sindhu said. \"Her life in exile was among her most creative yet challenging phases. Her command over multiple languages, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, and English, gave her poetry a unique linguistic depth,\" she added. Renowned historian and academic Prof Dr. Syed Jaffar Ahmed described Riaz as \"a multidimensional creator of resistance literature,\" lamenting how today's society has evolved into a one-dimensional entity with little space for such voices. He hailed her as a symbol of defiance, whose literary identity was rooted in the fight against authoritarianism. Noted poet and author Dr. Fakhra Naureen described Riaz as \"an under-celebrated yet towering literary woman,\" who not only challenged patriarchal norms but also offered mature literary evolution from a rebellious poet to a wise critic of society. The seminar concluded with an engaging Q&A session, reflecting the audience's deep interest in the intellectual and socio-political dimensions of Fahmida Riaz's life and works. The event was also attended by Ahmed Salim Study Centre, core committee members Anmol Fatima, Amina Sayed, Dr Ghazal Yaqoob and Dr Amjad Kallu.",
