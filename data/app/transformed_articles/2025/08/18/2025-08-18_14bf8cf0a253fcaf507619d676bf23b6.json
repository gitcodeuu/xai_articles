Ministry's Spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt said nominated banks have been instructed to continue receiving applications until the remaining quota is filled. He urged intending pilgrims to submit their applications at the nearest designated bank branches at the earliest. \"The process will be closed immediately once the last 3,500 seats are taken,\" the spokesperson added. The record response is the reflection of the strong interest of Pakistani citizens in performing Hajj under the government scheme for the upcoming year.",
