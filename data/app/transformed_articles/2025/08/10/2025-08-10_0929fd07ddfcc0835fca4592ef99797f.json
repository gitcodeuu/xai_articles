    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 10 (APP): Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) will deploy its Facilitation Vans at multiple locations across the federal capital from August 11 to 16, operating daily between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. (Saturday until 2:30 p.m.), to provide citizens with convenient access to driving license services, challan payments, and traffic-related assistance right in their localities. An ITP spokesperson told APP that two vans, GAC-709 and GAC-656, will serve residents in different areas throughout the week, ensuring they can obtain learner's permits, renew or replace driving licenses, seek traffic guidance, and access other ITP services without visiting the main offices. According to the schedule, Van GAC-709 will be at Media Town Head Office on Monday, F-10 Markaz on Tuesday, I-8 Markaz on Wednesday, E-11 Markaz on Friday, and DHA Phase-II on Saturday. Van GAC-656 will be stationed at Bani Gala Edopia School on Monday, Naval Complex E-8 on Tuesday, Bhara Kahu Wednesday Bazaar on Wednesday, NUST University G-13 on Friday, and G-9 Markaz on Saturday. The service will not operate on Thursday, August 14, in observance of Independence Day. He said the initiative reflects ITP's commitment to taking services to citizens' doorsteps and promoting road safety awareness. Citizens can contact Abdul Qadeer at 0300-2322883 (GAC-709) or Yasir Idrees at 0332-7100620 (GAC-656) for further details, or call helpline 1915 / 051-9260072 for assistance.",
