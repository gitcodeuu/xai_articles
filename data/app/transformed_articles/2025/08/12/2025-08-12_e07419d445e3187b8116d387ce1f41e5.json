Chaired by Senator Nasir Mehmood, the committee underscored the need for rightsizing within FGEHA, advocating internal restructuring over fresh appointments. Members expressed concern over alleged irregularities, unpaid rents, and persistent delays, urging swift corrective action and stronger accountability mechanisms. The committee also directed a comprehensive briefing on the dissolution of Pak PWD, with a full report to be presented at the next meeting. The meeting reviewed matters pertaining to the Ministry of Housing and Works and its attached departments. Other issues discussed included the pending rent of NAB Courts operating in the Federal Lodge, Wafaqi Colony, Lahore - outstanding since 2021 and amounting to Rs 63.378 million - as well as the current status of Pak PWD after its dissolution, among others.
