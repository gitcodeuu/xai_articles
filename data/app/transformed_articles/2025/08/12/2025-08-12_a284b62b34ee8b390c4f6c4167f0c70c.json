In his video message on Tuesday he stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had been instrumental in introducing Pakistan's first youth policy, launching the laptop distribution scheme, awarding scholarships, and providing soft loans to young entrepreneurs. He emphasised that 70% of Pakistan's population is under the age of 30, adding that the government remains committed to offering opportunities in fields such as artificial intelligence, information technology, and sports. On International Youth Day, Rana Mashhood said \"Pakistan is working hard to meet its global development targets, thanks to the efforts of local youth, as per this year's theme is \"'Local Youth Actions for the SDGs and Beyond\"'. He announced that under a new policy, laptops will be available for all on an interest-free loan basis, while Pakistanis securing overseas work permits will be eligible for interest-free loans of up to Rs 1 million to cover travel expenses. He also revealed that the government is finalising Pakistan's first National Youth and Adolescent Policy, which will address issues faced by age groups 10-15, 15-19, and 19-29.
