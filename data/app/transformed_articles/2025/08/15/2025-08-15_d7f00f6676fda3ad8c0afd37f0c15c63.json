    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 15 (APP):On Pakistan's busy roads, a new movement is rewriting the story and it's all about freedom, safety, and dignity for women. VSisters, the country's first all-women ride-hailing service, is not just about transport - it is about honor, and the unshakable promise of zero harassment. \"VSisters\" where, both rider and passenger are women, and every journey is a statement: women in Pakistan have the right to move freely, safely, and without fear. At the heart of this initiative is Hassan Tariq, an educated professional from Peshawar with a master's degree from the United Kingdom. A graduate of one of Peshawar's most prestigious schools, he began his career at HBL Karachi before stepping into entrepreneurship. His vision for VSisters was born not from business ambition, but from a deep personal conviction to protect and empower women. \"We don't just provide a ride,\" Mr. Tariq told APP. \"We provide peace of mind. Every woman who travels with us knows she is in safe hands.\" That conviction came from a painful memory. It was August last year, exactly one year ago when Hassan Tariq's life took a turn he could never undo. Stopped at a red light between Islamabad's F-10 and F-11, he noticed an elegant, educated young woman on the back of a rented bike. But instead of a safe ride, she was enduring humiliation - the male rider taunting and harassing her openly in traffic. Her patience snapped; she began striking him with her handbag in desperation. Cars slowed, bystanders turned to watch, and before anyone could intervene, the man sped off. Hassan sat frozen, a knot of anger and shame tightening in his chest. \"At that moment,\" he recalls, \"my ghairat burned. I thought, how can we call ourselves a civilized Muslim society when our women cannot even travel from one place to another without fear? That day, I vowed to create a service where no woman would have to feel that helpless again.\" Launched on June 16, 2025, after completing all legal and operational requirements, VSisters now operates in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore with 464 active female riders - 64 in Islamabad, 44 in Rawalpindi, and around 356 in Lahore. Expansion to Karachi, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala is already underway. More than a transport service, VSisters is a platform for women's empowerment. The company provides free motorbike training to women aged 18 and above, helping them earn an income and gain independence. \"Our aim is to make women not just passengers, but also drivers of change,\" Mr. Tariq said. Among VSisters' many success stories is Faryal, a Lahore-based rider who currently stands as one of the platform's highest earners, bringing in an income that comfortably surpasses what most women in similar jobs make. While many female workers in the transport sector struggle to get by, VSisters riders are earning nearly twice as much as their counterparts, thanks to fair pay, strong demand for safe travel, and the trust the brand has built among female commuters. For women like Faryal, it's not just a job - it's financial independence, dignity, and proof that women-led services can thrive in Pakistan. For riders like Nimra in Rawalpindi, the difference is life-changing: \"Before VSisters, I wanted to work but safety was always a concern. Now I earn well, and every passenger tells me they feel safe with me. It's empowering for both of us.\" Passengers feel the relief too. Ayesha, a university student in Islamabad, said, \"I travel without anxiety now. There's no inappropriate behavior, no fear. I reach home safely, every time.\" Women's rights activists say initiatives like VSisters are essential for reclaiming public spaces for women. \"Zero harassment isn't a luxury - it's a right. VSisters is proving that safety and empowerment can go hand in hand,\" said Sara Khan, a Lahore-based activist. With every pink-helmeted rider, VSisters is sending a message: women have the right to safety, the right to dignity, and the right to move - freely and fearlessly.",
