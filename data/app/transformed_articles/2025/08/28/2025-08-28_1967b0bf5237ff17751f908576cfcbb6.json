    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 28 (APP):The National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) has warned of a severe flood threat in the Chenab River, forecasting a flow of 700,000 to 800,000 cusecs at Trimmu Barrage around 4:00 PM on August 31. According to the advisory, potential severe flooding is likely to affect Jhang and adjoining areas, as floodwaters from the Chenab River are expected to surge toward Punjnad by the afternoon of September 3, 2025. A discharge ranging between 650,000 to 700,000 cusecs has been forecast, raising the risk of widespread inundation. Authorities have been directed to evacuate residents from nearby low-lying zones, while emergency teams remain on standby to manage the anticipated deluge. Evacuation directives have been issued for potentially affected districts including Hafizabad, Chiniot, Multan, Punjnad and Bahawalpur, while authorities may use the left bank area of 18-Hazari along the Chenab River as a breaching site to mitigate the expected flood situation. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), a rapid surge has been recorded in the Ravi River, with a high flood ranging from 150,029 to 200,000 cusecs expected at Balloki Barrage by 7:00 AM on August 29. The flood wave is anticipated to reach Sadhnai by September 1, where flows between 125,000 and 150,000 cusecs may pose a serious inundation threat to surrounding areas. Authorities have placed multiple regions on high alert due to the risk of flooding. In Lahore, high-risk union councils include Shahdara, Kot Mahbo, Jia Moosa, Aziz Colony, Qaiser Town, Faisal Park, Dheer, and Kot Begum. In Sheikhupura and Ferozewala, vulnerable areas include Faizpur Khoo, Dhameke, Daka, Burj Atari, and Kot Abdul Malik. Ganeshpur, spanning Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib districts, is also at risk. In Kasur and Pattoki, threatened localities comprise Phoolnagar, Rakh Khanke, Nathi Khalis, Lambe Jageer, Kot Sardar, Hanjrai Kalan, Bhattrowal Kalan, and Noshera Gaye. In Khanewal district, Ghauspur, Mian Channu, Umeed Garh, Kot Islam, Abdul Hakim, and Kabirwala may also be affected. On the directives of the Prime Minister, the NDMA is supervising all rescue and relief operations in the threatened areas. The NDMA spokesman stated that the National Emergencies Operation Center is fully operational round the clock, with NDMA coordinating closely with civil and military institutions. Residents near rivers and waterways have been advised to relocate to safer areas and follow local administration directives. People in flood-affected zones are urged to avoid unnecessary travel and stay in contact with rescue teams. Citizens are directed to prepare emergency kits with water, food, and medicines, safeguard important documents, and use the NDMA's Disaster Alert App for guidance.",
