    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 28 (APP): The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has directed all licensed entities under its regulation to adopt digital payment solutions in line with the governmentas vision of promoting a cashless economy. According to the directive, OGRA regulated businesses, including oil marketing companies, gas utilities, CNG stations, LPG and LNG operators, refineries, and lubricant marketers, must introduce and display digital payment options, particularly the State Bank of Pakistanas Raast QR Code at their outlets. The Authority emphasized that no outlet will be allowed to refuse customers opting for digital transactions. Full compliance is required by October 31, 2025. OGRA said the move supports the State Bankas digitization drive and is expected to improve financial inclusion, transparency, and operational efficiency across the energy sector. Businesses have been advised to coordinate with their banks, microfinance banks, or electronic money institutions to obtain free-of-cost Raast QR codes for timely implementation. aThis initiative will not only facilitate consumers but also strengthen Pakistanas digital payment ecosystem,a said OGRA spokesperson Imran Ghaznavi.",
