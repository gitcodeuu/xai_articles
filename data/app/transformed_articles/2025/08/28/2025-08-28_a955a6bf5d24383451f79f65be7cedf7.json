Talking to media, the minister stressed the need to set aside political differences and provide relief to the affected people. Abdul Aleem Khan welcomed the gesture of goodwill from the Chief Ministers of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, who not only expressed solidarity with Punjab in dealing with the flood situation but also offered-assistance from their respective provincial governments. He recalled that during the floods and heavy rains in Gilgit-Baltistan, Punjab also extended similar support, reflecting national unity. The federal minister assured the media that the National Highway Authority (NHA) and the Ministry of Communications will leave no stone unturned in maintaining, repairing, and restoring damaged roads across the country. He appreciated the Punjab government and administrative bodies for their timely preparations, which helped raise awareness among people and minimize losses. Highlighting the extraordinary rise in water levels in River Ravi, Aleem Khan said that he had never witnessed such a situation before, but expressed confidence that with collective efforts, the crisis would be handled effectively. He lauded the preparedness and swift response of rescue services and other institutions, hoping that the next 24 hours would also pass without major difficulties for the people, particularly those living around Shahdara.
