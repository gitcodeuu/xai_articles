Dr Shahid Mahmud, Advisor, COMSTECH, extended his sincere thanks to the distinguished experts from Ningbo University for their valuable contributions and praised the participants for their active engagement throughout the 19-day program. He noted that the course successfully combined theoretical depth with practical learning and will enable participants to apply AI tools effectively in their research and professional work. Sharing her experience, Ms. Huda Sarwar, Faculty Member, Rawalpindi Women University, remarked, \"First of all, I would like to thank COMSTECH and Ningbo University for arranging this course on Applied Biomedical AI. The one-month program was very well structured and engaging. I learned valuable concepts such as word embedding techniques, biomolecule encoding, and CNNs applied to biomedical data, which I can now apply in my future work. The teaching style was interactive, and overall, it was a very beneficial course.\" At the end of the ceremony, physical participants received certificates, while online participants were awarded digital certificates. The course featured leading scientists from Ningbo University and COMSTECH and is expected to foster long-term cooperation and innovation in biomedical AI across OIC Member States.",
