The prime minister chaired a high-level meeting here at the Prime Minister's House to review and strategize the promotion of tourism across Pakistan, a Prime Minister's Office news release said. \"Pakistan is immensely blessed by nature. From snow-covered mountains and lush forests to rivers, deserts, and a vibrant coastline, our country holds a unique and significant place in the world,\" the Prime Minister remarked.
