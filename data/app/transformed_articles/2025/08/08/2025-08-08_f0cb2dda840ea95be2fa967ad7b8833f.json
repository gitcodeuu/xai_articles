Moreover, approximately 315,000 students, including around 115,000 women, were provided professional IT training to ensure equal opportunities for women in the IT sector. The National Incubation Center supported 130 women-led startups, and dedicated training centers for women were established nationwide. Additionally, 2,200 federal government officers and staff were trained, and around 3,000 students received cybersecurity training. The representatives of the meeting were told that Rs. 6.2 billion in taxes were collected through Pak-App. E-Office implementation reached 98% in federal government offices, and 51 new systems were introduced to enhance governance. During the briefing on the telecom sector, it was told that last year, the target of providing 4G access to over 580,000 people was surpassed.
