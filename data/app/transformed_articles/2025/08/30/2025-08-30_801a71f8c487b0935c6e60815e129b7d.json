The Authority will serve as a central platform for inter-agency coordination, ensuring efficient trade and passenger movement at land ports,\" President Secretariat Press Wing said in a press release on Saturday. With this development, Pakistan became the third country in South Asia, after Bangladesh and India to establish a dedicated land port authority. The authority will introduce a robust mechanism to coordinate effectively with border management agencies, streamline trade facilitation, and enhance cross-border connectivity. It will also play a vital role in meeting Pakistan's obligations under international agreements and conventions. \"The establishment of the Pakistan Land Port Authority marks a significant step towards strengthening Pakistan's regional trade integration, improving border management, and enhancing economic connectivity with neighboring countries,\" it was further added.",
