The \"Dreams Becoming Reality\" initiative, launched in September 2024, reflects SK Hydro's commitment to the principle of \"extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits.\" Beyond education assistance, two major community projects-the Viewing Platform in the Head Region of the SK Hydropower Station and the Khan Area Government Service Center-are nearing completion, further enhancing local development. Following the ceremony, the DC of Mansehra and his delegation toured the powerhouse and switching station to review the operational performance of the hydropower station.
