Accompanied by senior officers, Aleem Khan issued on the spot instructions and expressed satisfaction over the restoration of traffic in minimum time. He directed NHA authorities that water flowing from the mountains should be routed under the roads instead of over it, so that road infrastructure and travelers remain safe from flood hazards. He noted that the National Highway Authority (NHA) and Frontier Works Organization (FWO) have jointly worked on war footing basis on the affected Highways and within minimal time opened Skardu and its surrounding roads for traffic while construction work on some bridges is still in progress. Talking on the occasion, Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan said that the heavy rains and flash floods on August 15 severely damaged lives, property and the communications system; however, NHA promptly began repair work and already opened several roads and highways in Gilgit-Baltistan for traffic.
