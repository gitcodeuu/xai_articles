    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 01 (APP): Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) has imposed a strict ban on the entry of heavy, overloaded vehicles and loader rickshaws into the federal capital, as part of a broader crackdown on traffic violations under drone surveillance, initiated on Friday. A public relations officer told APP on Friday that Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (R) Syed Zeeshan Haider has personally supervised the deployment of additional personnel on all major highways and intersections to ensure smoother traffic flow and public safety. He said the ITP will seize motorcycles and vehicles on the spot if found in violation of traffic laws, adding that violations such as signal breaking, over speeding, lane discipline breaches, and wrong parking will result in fines and legal action. \"Strict monitoring through drone cameras is being carried out to identify violators and ensure transparency in enforcement,\" CTO Zeeshan said. He added that the ITP will enforce traffic laws on an equal basis, without discrimination. He said the Islamabad Traffic Education Unit will remain active on major roads to raise public awareness, while senior officers will be present in the field to manage traffic in real-time and handle emerging situations. \"The safety of citizens and prevention of road accidents is our top priority,\" said the CTO, urging residents to cooperate by following traffic rules. \"No overloaded or heavy vehicle will be allowed to enter the city under any circumstances,\" he stressed.",
