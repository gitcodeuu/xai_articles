The chairman expressed strong condemnation of the Modi governmentas actions, particularly the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A on August 5, 2019. aThe Modi governmentas tendency for false flag operations and subsequent aggression has become all too familiar,a he added. He condemned the Pulwama incident, Indian aggression and demographic changes in IIOJ&K and highlighted a troubling pattern of cultural, civilizational and religious aggression, alongside grave human rights violations carried out by Indian forces in Kashmir. He said if the Kashmir conflict was not resolved, there would be no peace and stability in South Asia. He condemned the widespread atrocities committed by the Indian military, which includes the continued detention of Hurriyat leadership. Among those imprisoned, he mentioned leaders like Syed Shabir Shah, Yasin Malik, Musarrat Alam Bhat, and Dr Qasim Faktoo, urging the international community to intervene for their immediate release.
