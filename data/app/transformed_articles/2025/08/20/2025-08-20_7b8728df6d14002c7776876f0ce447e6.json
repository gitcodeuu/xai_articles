    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 20 (APP): A state-of-the-art data center was inaugurated on Wednesday to enhance the operational efficiency and streamline data management for registered Allied Health Professionals (AHPs). The facility was officially launched by the Allied Health Professional Council (AHPC), which functions under the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (NHSR&C). The inauguration ceremony was led by AHPC President Dr. Sajid Mehmood and attended by representatives of affiliated institutes, healthcare professionals, and council officials. The new system will enable smooth registration processes, accurate record-keeping and supporting improved governance and decision-making within the allied health sector. Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Sajid Mehmood said the transition from manual to online registration would significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of maintaining professional records. He noted that the new system would facilitate registration of AHPs, track their service tenure across institutions, and generate comprehensive records to support effective governance and decision-making. Participants appreciated the initiative, describing it as timely and essential, while also sharing suggestions for further improvement of the system. The AHPC registers teaching hospitals, institutes, and organizations offering courses in 30 defined disciplines, including anesthesia technology, blood banking technology, and medical laboratory technology, besides others. It also registers academic professionals such as teachers, professors, and lecturers in these fields. Recently, the Council issued provisional certificates to more than 170 institutes nationwide, with several applications still under process.",
