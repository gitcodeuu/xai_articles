Each shelter kit is equipped with essential relief items, including a shelter unit, solar panels with LED lights, two thermal blankets, plastic mats, durable kitchen sets, water coolers, and antibacterial soap. Each food package, weighing 95 kilograms, contains wheat flour, sugar, lentils, and cooking oil, carefully designed to meet the immediate nutritional needs of affected families.
