    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 20 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved its verdict on a petition against the appointment of Chairman Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). Justice Babar Sattar issued a written order for today's hearing on the petition of Usama Khilji. The court directed the Chairman PTA, Additional Attorney General and other parties to submit written arguments by September 8. The party who wants to submit written arguments can submit them by the said date. The order said that the federal government can submit the record of the process of appointment of the Chairman PTA if it wants. It said that the court had already heard detailed arguments of the lawyers of the parties in the case. After the 26th Amendment, the parties were given the opportunity to provide more judicial assistance, it said. The Assistant Attorney General told the court today that the Additional Attorney General is on leave and sought more time to submit response on behalf of federal government. It said that the PTA's lawyer also filed a request to postpone the hearing. Chairman PTA's lawyer was also not available in today's hearing, the written order said.",
