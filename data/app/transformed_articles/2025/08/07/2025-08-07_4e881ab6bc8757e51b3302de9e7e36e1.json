Chairman Randhawa welcomed the lawmakers and underscored the importance of working in sync with elected representatives to resolve civic issues more effectively. \"The role of Islamabad's parliamentarians is vital in guiding ongoing development projects and ensuring balanced progress in both urban and rural areas,\" Randhawa said. Lawmakers praised the CDA's development initiatives under Randhawa's leadership and pledged full support for efforts aimed at improving infrastructure, beautification, and welfare services. They also offered suggestions to tackle persistent civic problems. The meeting covered a broad agenda, including the beautification of the Islamabad Expressway, where officials discussed enhancing green belts through focused horticultural efforts. Development of sports and recreational facilities under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) was also highlighted, with the Director General Environment appointed as the focal person to oversee the better use of parks, green areas, and open spaces. Infrastructure upgrades featured prominently in the talks. These included the construction and renovation of major highways, the installation of permanent and decorative lighting in various sectors, and the creation of new parks alongside the improvement of existing ones. Public transport improvements were also discussed, particularly the expansion of electric bus services. Parliamentarians emphasized the success of the existing fleet and recommended expanding the routes. Randhawa assured them that a comprehensive review would be undertaken to align services with commuter needs. The meeting also addressed critical issues related to water and sewage. The CDA briefed lawmakers on the recent establishment of the Islamabad Water Authority, a step aimed at managing the city's water resources more effectively. The delegation was also informed of plans to identify and allocate land for new graveyards in response to the capital's growing population. Participants received updates on the CDA's ongoing crackdown against illegal constructions and encroachments, which are being jointly undertaken with the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration. Randhawa highlighted that these operations are being carried out without discrimination, with a focus on restoring public spaces and enhancing the city's green cover through tree planting. Another key highlight of the session was the CDA's transition toward a cashless and paperless administrative system. Chairman Randhawa said that efforts are underway to fully digitize internal processes to promote transparency, accountability, and efficiency in public service delivery. \"All possible efforts will be made to ensure timely completion of ongoing projects, with strict adherence to legal requirements,\" Randhawa assured the delegation. The meeting concluded with a unanimous decision to establish a formal follow-up mechanism, which will enable regular monitoring of development progress and ensure the timely resolution of issues faced by Islamabad's residents.",
