The webinar, titled \"Investment in Pakistan's HealthTech, Pharma, and Hospitals: Challenges and Opportunities\", brought together healthcare professionals, researchers, and policy advocates to explore how innovation is reshaping healthcare and what policy gaps still need attention, said a press release issued on Thursday. Dr. Imtiaz Ahmed, a leading health professional with expertise in microbiology and genetics, underscored the role of telemedicine and AI diagnostics in transforming healthcare in Pakistan, particularly for remote areas with limited medical staff.Buy vitamins and supplements \"Telemedicine is no longer optional-it is essential,\" said Dr. Imtiaz. \"AI diagnostic centers can help meet rising patient demands where healthcare personnel are scarce.\" He emphasized public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a means to enhance healthcare access and efficiency in rural communities, but also cautioned about the unregulated pharmaceutical sector, which continues to pose serious challenges.

Uneesa Saeed and Naba Mansoor spoke on how emerging technologies like wearable health devices, virtual consultations, and automated diagnostics are already making a difference in Pakistan's healthcare landscape. \"Innovation isn't just about new tools,\" said Uneesa. \"It's about changing how and where we deliver healthcare.\" Naba Mansoor highlighted the importance of integrating blockchain and digital tracking in the pharma industry to improve transparency and efficiency in service delivery.Buy vitamins and supplements Dr. Tariq Khan, Convenor of Alliance Good Governance Foundation, wrapped up the session by calling technology a \"powerful equalizer\" in healthcare-if supported by inclusive policies. \"We cannot treat healthcare as a privilege.

He urged continued collaboration among stakeholders, including civil society and government, to push for concrete reforms in innovation, funding, and service delivery.
