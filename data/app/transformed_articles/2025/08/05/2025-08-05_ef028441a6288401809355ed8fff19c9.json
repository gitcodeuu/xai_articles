Speaking at the meeting, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasized that small and medium-sized businesses play a pivotal role in the development and prosperity of the country. \"The growth of SMEs is among the top priorities of the government, and we are implementing reforms and initiatives on a fast-track basis to support this critical sector,\" he said. During the session, the committee was briefed on recent reforms within SMEDA and key initiatives aimed at strengthening the SME ecosystem. It was revealed that, on the Prime Minister's special directive, businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 30 million have now been classified as micro enterprises and brought under SMEDA's purview. Highlighting progress on women-led businesses, officials informed the prime minister that a draft of the Women Entrepreneurship Policy has been finalized and will soon be presented to the federal cabinet for approval.
