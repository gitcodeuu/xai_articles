The ambassador, in his keynote address at a ceremony to observe Youm-e-Istehsal Kashmir, strongly condemned India's ongoing atrocities and attempts at demographic engineering in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The event was a somber reminder of the ongoing suffering of the Kashmiri people under Indian occupation and reaffirmed Pakistan's steadfast solidarity with their legitimate struggle. The programme featured moving speeches and poetic tributes. President of the Pakistan Press Club Belgium Imran Saqib delivered powerful verses that captured the pain, perseverance, and indomitable spirit of the Kashmiri people. Ambassador Qureshi reaffirmed Pakistan's unwavering political, diplomatic, and moral support to the Kashmiri people in their just and rightful struggle for self-determination. In his address, Chairman of the Kashmir Council-EU Ali Raza Syed emphasized the urgent need for sustained international attention and accountability to address the deepening humanitarian crisis.
