Addressing the participants, the minister thanked the people for expressing solidarity with their Kashmiri brethren and urged the international community to put pressure on India to curb state terrorism, the continued military siege since 5th August 2019 and other atrocities in IIOJK. Pakistan will not allow India to succeed in its nefarious designs of turning the Muslim majority into the minority in the IIOJK, he added.The participants were chanting slogans against India and carrying placards and banners inscribed with slogans \"Go India, Go Back\", \"Stop Killing in Kashmir and Stop HR Violation in Occupied Kashmir\". One minute's silence was also observed in memory of the martyrs in Kashmir. \"Our strong and steadfast moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people will continue till the realization of their inalienable right to self-determination,\" he reiterated. Qasim Noon MNA said that 'Youm-e-Istehsal' was a somber occasion to recall India's illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019 in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). That day, India scrapped the special status of IIOJK and bifurcated it into two so-called 'Union Territories' to alter its internationally recognized disputed status and undermine the right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people.
