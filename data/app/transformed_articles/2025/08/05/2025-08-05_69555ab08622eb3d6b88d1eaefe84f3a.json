    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 5 (APP):In order to show solidarity with the people of India-held Kashmir (IHK), a one-minute silence has been observed across the country at 10 am here on Tuesday. According to the details, a one-minute silence has been observed at 10:00 am across the country to mark \" Youm-e-Istehsal \". The main theme of the day was to support the Kashmiris who were deprived of their basic right after the abrogation of 35-A and 370 articles on August 5, 2019. The Pakistani nation has unwavering support for the struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination under the UN resolutions. The day is being marked to expose the worst ever oppression perpetrated by India against Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K). The rest of the country's all concerned departments will hold Kashmir rallies and gatherings at divisional, district, and tehsil levels.",
