The prime minister offered prayers for those who lost their lives and wished a speedy recovery for the injured. Highlighting Pakistan's minimal contribution to global emissions, the prime minister stressed that despite the fact that Pakistan contributed almost zero emissions, it was among the top ten nations most affected by climate change-induced disasters. \"Despite Pakistan's near-zero emissions, we suffer huge devastation every year due to global warming,\" he noted. He also emphasized the importance of global climate conferences, directing the authorities to ensure active participation aimed at securing funds for building resilient infrastructure to combat future disasters. The prime minister acknowledged the visible climate changes affecting Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, and other parts of the country, underlining the critical role of the Ministry of Climate Change in addressing these challenges. To restore flood- and rain-damaged roads, the prime minister also directed the Ministry of Communications to expedite repair work. Additionally, PM Shehbaz expressed his commitment to overseeing the completion of development projects such as the Danish Schools and the Solar Park that was recently approved by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP). He reaffirmed his personal monitoring of the solar park project, adding that he will revisit the area soon to lay foundation of Daanish Schools.",
