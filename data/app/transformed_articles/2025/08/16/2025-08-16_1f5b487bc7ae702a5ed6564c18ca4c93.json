During a review meeting on Jinnah Medical Complex and Research Center, he directed that all the measures related to the construction of the complex should be completed within the stipulated period of time. The meeting was presented with the concept design of the complex prepared by the Chinese company Hongkong-AOHUA. The company which has over 30 years of experience in designing more than 1,000 hospitals, prepared the concept design of the hospital free of cost, PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.

The prime minister observed that a Chinese company prepared a world-class concept design for a hospital in Pakistan without any compensation which was a clear testament to the strong Pak-China friendship and growing people-to-people ties. \"We are deeply grateful to the leadership of the Chinese company and every individual involved in the design process,\" he said, adding this gift from the Chinese company would always be remembered by the government, the people of Pakistan, and those who would get treatment in this hospital. The prime minister desired that a technical review of the design prepared by the Chinese company be conducted.
