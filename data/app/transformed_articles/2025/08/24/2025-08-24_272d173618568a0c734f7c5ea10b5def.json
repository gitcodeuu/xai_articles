According to the report of Federal Flood Commission (FFC) issued here Sunday, flash flooding is also expected in the nullahs of D.G. Khan and northeastern Balochistan, while medium to high level flows are expected in the nullahs of river Ravi and Chenab during the next 48 hours. Urban flooding is expected in Lahore, Gujranwala and Rawalpindi within the next two days. Widespread thunderstorm/rain with scattered heavy to very heavy falls/ torrential rains is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum along with north and northeastern Punjab from 25th August to 27th August 2025, besides, scattered thunderstorm/rain of moderate to heavy intensity over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus during the said period. Due to the expected widespread rainfall over the upper catchments of the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and the tributaries of the river Kabul, a significant rise in flows is anticipated within next 48 hours. According to FFC, River Indus is running in high flood at Guddu while medium flood at sukkur with rising trend. Similarly, River Sutlej is flowing in medium flood with falling trend at Ganda Singh Wala.
