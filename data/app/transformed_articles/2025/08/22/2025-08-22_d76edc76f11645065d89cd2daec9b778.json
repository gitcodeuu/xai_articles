He further criticized Indiaas asabre-rattling and war-mongering whenever confronted with inconvenient facts,a adding that unfounded allegations and fabricated narratives areflect New Delhias lack of diplomatic confidence.a He said Indiaas attempt to involve third countries in its propaganda ais a futile effort to exert pressure on Pakistan through distortion of facts.a Contrasting Indiaas approach with Pakistanas, the FO Spokesperson emphasized: aPakistan shall continue to act as a responsible member of the international community. However, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistanas sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership.a Ambassador Khan concluded that instead of aprovocative rhetoric,a India should focus on fulfilling its international obligations, particularly on issues of regional peace, counterterrorism and adherence to binding international treaties such as the Indus Waters Treaty.",
