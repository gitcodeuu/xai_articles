    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP):The Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) has formally published the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, replacing the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. This major reform reflects the Court's commitment to modernization, digitalization, and bring justice system procedural clarity, in line with global governance of law. Framed under Article 191 of the Constitution, the new Rules replace outdated provisions and bring court procedures in line with contemporary legal, constitutional, and technological developments. They have come into immediate effect. To carry out this revision, the Chief Justice of Pakistan constituted a committee comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. The Committee engaged with Judges, the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association, and other Bar Associations. The final draft was placed before the Full Court and approved after detailed deliberation. The Supreme Court Rules, 2025 consist of seven Parts, thirty-eight Orders, and six Schedules, with approximately 280 provisions amended (including 160 from the Schedules), 60 new provisions added, and 5 outdated provisions deleted.
