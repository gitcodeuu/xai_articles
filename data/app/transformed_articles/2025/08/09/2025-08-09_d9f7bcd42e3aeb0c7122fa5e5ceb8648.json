We congratulate President Ilham Aliyev and the people of Azerbaijan on this historic agreement, that reflects wisdom, foresight and sagacity in charting a course for a peaceful future for their region,\" the prime minister posted on X account. He further said that Pakistan had always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan, and stood with them at this proud moment of their history. \"We also appreciate the facilitation role of the United States, under President Donald Trump, in bringing the two sides together and securing an agreement that opens new avenues for trade, connectivity, and regional integration.
