    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 11 (APP):Pakistan welcomed the award rendered by the Court of Arbitration on the issues of General Interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), announced on August 8, 2025, and publicized on the Court's website on Monday. In a statement, the Foreign Office Spokesperson said, \"The Award interprets the designed criteria for the new run-of-river hydropower projects, to be constructed by India on the Western Rivers (Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus)\". \"In a significant finding, the Court has declared that India shall let flow the waters of the Western Rivers for Pakistan's unrestricted use. In that connection, the specified exceptions for generation of hydro-electric plants must conform strictly to the requirements laid down in the Treaty, rather than to what India might consider an 'ideal' or 'best practices' approach,\" he added. He said the Court's findings on low-level outlets, gated spillways, intakes for the turbines, and free-board are in line with Pakistan's interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty. The Award also limits India from maximizing the pondage volume. Notably, the Court has observed that the Awards of a Court of Arbitration are final and binding on the Parties (India and Pakistan), and have a controlling legal effect on subsequent Courts of Arbitration and Neutral Experts. Recognizing Pakistan's vulnerability as the downstream riparian, the Court has further observed that the object and purpose of the Indus Waters Treaty, as it relates to the Western Rivers, is to de-limit the two states' respective rights and obligations, in conjunction with mutual cooperation and effective dispute resolutions procedures. The Award carries special significance in the wake of India's recent announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, and its earlier decision to boycott the proceedings of the Court of Arbitration. It is an endorsement of Pakistan's historical stance on the afore-stated issues. The Spokesperson said, \"Pakistan remains committed to full implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty. It also expects India to immediately resume the normal functioning of the Treaty, and faithfully implement the Award announced by the Court of Arbitration.\"",
