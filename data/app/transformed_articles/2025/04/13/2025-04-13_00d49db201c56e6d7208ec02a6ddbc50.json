In a statement, the Foreign Office Spokesperson said, \"We hope for Iranian side's full cooperation in investigating the matter and in timely repatriation of victims' remains.\" \"Eight Pakistani nationals were tragically killed yesterday in Mehrestan county, Sistan-Baluchistan province, located approximately 230 kilometers from the Pakistan-Iran border.
