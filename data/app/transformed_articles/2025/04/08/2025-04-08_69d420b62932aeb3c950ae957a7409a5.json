    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 8 (APP):Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Minister for Economy of Azerbaijan, Mikayil Jabbarov, in a high-level meeting on Tuesday underscored the mutual ambition to fast-track priority projects that can serve as catalysts for broader economic initiatives-especially in sectors such as infrastructure, energy, and IT. The meeting between the deputy prime minister and the Azerbaijan minister aimed to accelerate ongoing efforts to strengthen bilateral economic cooperation, whereas both the dignitaries reaffirmed the shared commitment to enhancing trade, investment, and long-term economic collaboration between the two brotherly nations, a DPM's office news release said. The meeting discussions also touched upon emerging opportunities in green energy, with both sides exploring potential joint ventures and strategic investments. The Pakistani delegation conveyed its gratitude and appreciation to Minister Jabbarov for his leadership and dedication to deepening Pak-Azerbaijan economic ties, which have the potential of high growth. The personal interest and guidance of the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, continue to serve as a driving force in translating the strong political will between the two countries into tangible economic partnerships. It was noted that both sides have been working diligently since the recent visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Azerbaijan, which catalyzed a renewed focus on critical investment projects. This momentum has been sustained through consistent engagement between the relevant authorities of both countries, including through platforms such as the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), with a particular emphasis on Government-to-Government (G2G) and Business-to-Business (B2B) collaboration. Ministry of Commerce has also prepared a comprehensive roadmap aimed at elevating bilateral trade volumes and diversifying the areas of cooperation. This includes actionable measures to create a more conducive environment for businesses and investors from both countries. Moreover, a number of agreements and MoUs will be signed during the upcoming visit of the President of Azerbaijan to Pakistan, marking a significant milestone in advancing bilateral cooperation. Both parties reaffirmed their resolve to continue working closely to unlock the full potential of their bilateral relationship and to promote sustainable economic growth and prosperity for both nations.",
