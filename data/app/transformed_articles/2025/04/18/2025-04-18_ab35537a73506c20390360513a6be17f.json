The federal minister said Saudi government has further improved the overall Hajj arrangements and also introduced NUSUK and other new initiatives while the government of Pakistan made the best arrangements as well to facilitate the pilgrims this year which included quality residence near the Haramain Sharifain, round the clock transport, air conditioned tents and other facilities. For the convenience of Hujjaj e Karam, quality residential facilities have been arranged at the minimum possible distance in the Markazia area of Madina Munawara and Batha Quraish, Azizia and other central areas of Makkah Mukarama, he said and added that staff of the ministry and Muavneen would be available for assistance of Hujjaj Karam there. Under the guidance of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Ministry is making all out efforts to ensure maxim facilitation of Hujjaj so that they could perform Hajj- one of the essential religious obligations in Islam- with comfort and peace of mind, he stated. He assured every possible facilitation and assistance to the intending Hujjaj and requested them to pray for peace, progress, stability and prosperity of the country and particularly for gallant sons of the nation who sacrificed their lives in defense of the motherland. Responding to a query about the issue of private Hajj tour operators, the federal minister informed that due to non compliance of Saudi Hajj policies over 300000 intending Hujjaj from different countries including Pakistan were facing problems. The government has taken the issue with the Saudi Hajj ministry and 10000 cases from Pakistan got clearance, he informed and added that some Hajj tour operators failed to fulfill the requirement and commitments with Saudi authorities and business partners within the committed time despite repeated directives by the religious affairs ministry.
