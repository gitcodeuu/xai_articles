According to the Ministry's Spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt, the program covers first aid, CPR, civil defense, and special handling techniques, and is a crucial component of preparations for Hajj 2025. He informed that Joint Secretary of the Ministry, Asadullah Faiz, is personally overseeing all training activities to ensure their effective implementation.
