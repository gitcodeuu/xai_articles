    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 29 (APP):Chairman Senate of Pakistan, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani Tuesday met with Mohamed Ould Errachid President of Morocco's Upper House, and discussed matters of mutual interest. The two leaders reaffirmed the close and historic relations between Pakistan and Morocco said a news release received here. Gilani said Pakistan and Morocco share deep-rooted ties based on religion, brotherhood, culture, and history. He stressed that Pakistan values its long-standing relationship with Morocco and appreciates their common positions on key regional and global issues. \"Morocco and Pakistan have always supported each other at international forums,\" Gilani said. He recalled a symbolic gesture from 1952 when Pakistan issued a passport to Moroccan leader Ahmed Balafrej to attend a United Nations session - highlighting Pakistan's early support for Morocco's sovereignty. He called for stronger parliamentary cooperation between the two countries, particularly through exchanges involving youth and the business community. He said such interactions can help build lasting bonds and shared progress. Gilani praised Morocco's cultural heritage and highlighted opportunities for partnership in sectors like agriculture, information technology, education, vocational training, and tourism. He also called for greater unity among Muslim countries to address the pressing challenges faced by the Ummah. Congratulating Morocco on its rich history of over 1,200 years, Gilani commended President for successfully organizing the 3rd South-South Parliamentary Forum. He said the forum provided an important platform to address global issues like climate change, food security, and cooperation among developing countries. He also extended his best wishes for the recovery of King Mohammed VI. He expressed pride in being unanimously elected as the founding chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers' Conference. He said it was an honor for both himself and Pakistan. The event was attended by parliamentary speakers and delegates from over 150 countries. President Mohamed Ould Errachid thanked Gilani for attending the forum and described Pakistan as an important country in the Islamic world. He praised Pakistan's efforts to promote unity among Muslim nations and said parliamentary relations could help bring the people of both countries closer. On the occasion, both sides signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance cooperation between their parliaments, renewing ties after a gap of four years. The two leaders also agreed to activate the Pakistan-Morocco Joint Ministerial Commission and to strengthen parliamentary cooperation in advancing shared interests at regional and international levels.",
