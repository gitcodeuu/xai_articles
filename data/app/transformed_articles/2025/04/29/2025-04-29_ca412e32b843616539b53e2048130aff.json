She issued a pointed warning to India, stating, aIndia must understand that there is a big difference between what happens in their films and in the battle grounds. Continuing her remarks in the Senate, Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan said that Pakistan have the respect for Sikh community, particularly acknowledging the Sikh leader who expressed support for Pakistana also highlighted the growing voices within India challenging the governmentas stance. Senator Raja Nasir Abbas warned that Pakistanas enemy is gradually advancing its agenda and aims to destabilize Pakistan. He emphasized that Indiaas foreign policy is clearly aligned against Pakistan, with efforts underway to isolate the country on the global stage. Senator Abbas called for a strong and decisive response to Indiaas actions, stating that aIndia must be given a fitting reply.a He stressed that national unity is the need of the hour and urged the political leadership to set aside internal differences and act collectively as one nation to counter Indiaas growing hostility. Meanwhile, Senator Nasir Mehmood Butt stated that Pakistan is a proud and dignified nation that will give a strong and fitting response to any aggression. He stressed the importance of sending a clear and unified message from the Senate of Pakistan to India. aNarendra Modi is a terrorist,a he said, adding that the country must not tolerate any hostile actions from India. Senator Butt also criticized former Prime Minister Imran Khanas decision to release Indian pilot Abhinandan just two hours after his capture, calling it a mistake. Senator Dinesh Kumar condemned the loss of innocent lives in the Pahalgam incident. He praised the timely condemnation of the attack by Pakistanas top leadership, acknowledging their responsible stance on the matter. He emphasized that Pakistan is currently grappling with internal conflicts and fighting a war against terrorism. In such a situation, Indiaas allegations against Pakistan are nothing more than a conspiracy, he said. aI am proud to be a patriotic Baloch and a Pakistani Hindu,a said Kumar. aMy religion teaches me that no innocent life should be taken.a He also addressed the Indian mediaas reaction to the recent statement by Pakistanas Army Chief regarding the two-nation theory, saying it was unnecessarily exaggerated. aThere was nothing controversial in the statement. The concept of the two-nation theory was, in fact, presented by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Allama Iqbal, and Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It is a historical reality,a he added. Senator Kamil Ali Agha stated that the speeches made by senators in the Senate reflect a clear message: the nation stands united against the enemy. He emphasized that Pakistan has repeatedly taught India a lesson, and the Pahalgam incident has now been exposed as a false flag operation. He pointed out that even an Indian general has acknowledged the incident was based on falsehood. Agha praised the Pakistani media for demonstrating responsibility in its coverage. Speaking on the Indus Waters Treaty, he warned that if India attempts to block Pakistanas water, then Pakistan will destroy all the illegal dams constructed in Indian Illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir. He added that India has already violated agreements by diverting Pakistanas share of water in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, which is a clear breach of the treaty.",
