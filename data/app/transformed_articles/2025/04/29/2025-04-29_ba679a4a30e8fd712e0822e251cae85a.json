    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, April 29 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar Tuesday held a telephone conversation with Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary Peter Szijjarto. The DPM/FM apprised him on the current regional situation and strongly rejected India's baseless propaganda and unilateral illegal actions against Pakistan, specifically holding Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance - a clear violation of international law, Foreign Office Spokesperson said in a press release. Reaffirming Pakistan's commitment to promote peace and stability, Dar emphasized Pakistan's resolve to defend its national interests. FM Szijjarto underscored the importance of de-escalating the situation through dialogue and peaceful resolution of issues. The DPM/FM also appreciated the excellent momentum in bilateral relations after Szijjarto's recent visit to Islamabad.",
