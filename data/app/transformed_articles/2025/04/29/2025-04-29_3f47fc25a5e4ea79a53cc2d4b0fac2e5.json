The consultation was organized by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in collaboration with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), said a press release. PAFST is launched to deliberate on food systems transformation in alignment with national, regional and international policies. It brought together key stakeholders to support policy reforms, promote climate-smart agriculture, and improve access to affordable and nutritious food. Further, the event discussed competing political interests and demands, limited budgets, and tight timelines to strengthen food systems. The Alliance will also work to strengthen Pakistan's voice in global food systems discussions, including those under the UN Food Systems Summit and climate negotiations. The platform will be steered by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, with SDPI serving as the secretariat and GAIN providing advisory support. The Alliance will focus on evidence-based policymaking, market system improvements, climate resilience, and knowledge sharing, with a special emphasis on youth, women, and farmers. Speaking at the consultation, Dr. Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI, said, \"Food security is not just about hunger; it is about economic stability, resilience to climate change, and national security.
