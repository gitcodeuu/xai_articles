    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 29 (APP): The Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to ensure merit-based, transparent, and computerised recruitment for CDA vacancies. The agreement aims to address workforce shortages by hiring qualified, skilled, and IT-proficient professionals through a modern, automated testing system. The signing ceremony took place during a high-level meeting chaired by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa at the CDA headquarters on Tuesday. Attendees included CDA members, NUST representatives, and senior officials. Under the MoU, NUST will conduct fully computerised written tests and oversee the recruitment process to ensure fairness and efficiency. The system will screen applications, administer exams, and evaluate candidates using advanced technology, eliminating human bias. Chairman Randhawa emphasised that the initiative prioritises quality, transparency, and merit over mere hiring targets. \"CDA seeks educated, skilled, and hardworking individuals. These tests aren't just about recruitment-they're about maintaining high standards,\" he stated. He added that the partnership with NUST, known for its rigorous merit-based systems, aligns with CDA's goal of modernising its workforce. Randhawa highlighted the need for an effective monitoring system to enhance institutional performance. \"Collaborating with NUST is a milestone in ensuring CDA recruits talent that meets contemporary demands,\" he said. The chairman reiterated CDA's commitment to providing equal opportunities for youth equipped with modern IT skills. Both institutions agreed to explore further collaboration in research and innovation. NUST's delegation praised CDA's performance and assured that the university would leverage its technological expertise to select candidates capable of contributing to Islamabad's development.",
