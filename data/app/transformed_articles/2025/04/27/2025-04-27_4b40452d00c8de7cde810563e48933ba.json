Sources said that in Mohali, Hindu extremists harassed a Kashmiri female student residing in a hostel. The student said that Hindu extremists kicked the door of her hostel room, hurled abuses at her, and threatened her with dire consequences. \"I had to flee along with my friend to escape the attackers,\" she added. In Chandigarh, a group of Kashmiri students was attacked at a university, the sources said. Similarly, in Dehradun, the \"Hindu Rakshak Dal\" issued a video message warning Kashmiris, they said.
