    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 14 (APP):The delegates from across the globe on Monday gathered here at Jinnah Convention Centre for the inaugural of Overseas Pakistanis Convention 2025, termed the event as a timely initiative and expressed hope that it would help address long-standing issues faced by overseas communities. Talking to APP, attendees from countries including the United States, South Korea, Netherlands, Singapore, Canada and others praised the government for organizing the first-of-its-kind event focused entirely on the Pakistani diaspora. Ali Cheema, who traveled from South Korea, said Pakistan remains close to the hearts of overseas citizens. \"Pakistan lives in our soul and we stand with the it for the construction and development of our homeland\", he added. He stressed the country's potential for investment and added that many delegates came with the intention to explore economic opportunities in various sectors. Bushra Salman, a participant from the United States, said that the government of Pakistan deserves appreciations for organizing the convention for the first time in the history of Overseas Pakistanis. She noted that the convention allowed for direct dialogue between overseas Pakistanis and government departments. She said the platform enabled attendees to raise issues and seek practical solutions in person. From the Netherlands, Nawabzada Asghar Ali highlighted the presence of service counters set up by key institutions such as NADRA, FIA, NAB, the Passport Office, State Bank, and FBR. These counters, he said, provided immediate support and guidance to overseas attendees. He also appreciated the reception and transport arrangements provided by the authorities. Abdul Latif Siddiqui, visiting from Singapore, emphasized that overseas Pakistanis are eager to contribute to the country's progress. He acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's role in making the event possible and called it a step toward building stronger connections with the global Pakistani community. Waleed Mushtaq, another delegate, suggested the creation of a centralized \"one-window\" facility to help overseas citizens deal with property and administrative matters more efficiently. He said this would reduce the need to visit multiple offices and streamline support for diaspora-related issues. Farah Zafar, from Canada, thanked the government for giving overseas Pakistanis the status of state guests during the event. She said such recognition would help rebuild trust between the state and its citizens living abroad. The convention served as a platform for overseas Pakistanis to voice concerns, seek reforms, and explore ways to contribute to national development.",
