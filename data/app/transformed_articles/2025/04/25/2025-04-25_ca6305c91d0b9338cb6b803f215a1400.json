In his remarks on the launch of the programme, Chairman HEC Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed termed the initiative as a start of a paramount mission to promote the teachings of Quran.

Addressing the closing ceremony, Managing Director NAHE Ms. Noor Amna Malik congratulated the training participants on completion of their course and urged them to pass on the knowledge gained in the event so that it casts cascading and multiplying results.
