    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 21 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif Monday said the government was striving to resolve the issues of overseas Pakistanis on a priority basis and working to provide them more facilities. He was chairing a special meeting on matters related to overseas Pakistanis. He said the overseas Pakistanis would be given opportunities of investment in Pakistan according to their expertise. Overseas Pakistanis played the role of ambassadors of Pakistan in the outside world, he said, adding overseas Pakistanis rendered great services for Pakistan. The prime minister said a large number of overseas Pakistanis attended the recently held overseas convention, which showed their trust in the policies of the government. \"We salute the true sentiments of overseas Pakistanis and their love and sacrifices for their country,\" he said adding the overseas Pakistanis had made a name for themselves and their country by working diligently all across the world. The prime minister said expatriates worked day and night as professionals in the fields of medicine, education, engineering, and consultancy, and earned legitimately. The government of Pakistan recently in recognition of the services of overseas Pakistanis gave a big package of incentives, he continued. He said those overseas Pakistanis who performed prominently in different fields and those who sent the highest remittances through the State Bank would be given civil awards in view of their services. The meeting was briefed on the progress regarding the facilities announced by the government and the strategy to implement them.
