    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 09 (APP):The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA), in collaboration with the local administration, conducted joint safety inspections of LPG storage tanks, bowzers and cylinder manufacturing facilities located in the peripheral areas of Lahore during March 2025. During the process, three LPG equipment manufacturer premises were inspected, namely M/s Elite Metal Tek (Private) Limited, M/s Hi-Tek Manufacturing (Private) Limited and M/s Unique Metal Engineering Services Limited, said a news release. Violations of technical and safety standards were observed, which included the production of oversized LPG bowzers, the absence of essential safety systems, unlicensed bowzers present on-site, and operations without mandatory registration from the Deputy Commissioner and Civil Defence authorities. As a result, two facilities, namely M/s Hi-Tek Manufacturing (Private) Limited and M/s Unique Metal Engineering Services Limited, where serious violations were observed, were sealed by the district administration. The Authority is initiating regulatory action under applicable laws, which may result in the delisting/cancellation of licenses of non-compliant entities. OGRA maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward unsafe, non-compliant and unauthorized manufacturing practices. Surprise inspections will continue nationwide to ensure compliance with safety standards and regulatory compliance in LPG equipment manufacturing.",
