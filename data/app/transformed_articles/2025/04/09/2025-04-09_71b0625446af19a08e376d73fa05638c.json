    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 09 (APP):The lower court of Islamabad on Wednesday expressed dismay over the delay in submitting the investigation report in a case against Rauf Hassan and others, who are accused of spreading propaganda against state institutions. Meanwhile, the court maintained a show-cause notice against the investigating officer and gave a final deadline to submit the report. During the today's hearing, Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah showed dissatisfaction when the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) failed to present the challan (investigation report) in the case registered against Rauf Hassan and several others. The court also noted that no lawyer appeared on behalf of the accused. The court had summoned the investigating officer to submit the case file but was informed that the report was still not ready. This delay drew a strong response from the judge, who reminded the investigation team that they were already issued a show-cause notice for negligence. The judge remarked that the court was giving the officer one last chance to present the challan. The notice issued earlier will remain in effect until further orders. The hearing has now been postponed until April 15. This case was registered by the FIA and involves allegations of spreading misinformation and harmful content against national institutions.",
