    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 09 (APP):The National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), in collaboration with the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is hosting a two-day national conference titled \"From Promise to Action: Advancing SDG 16 for Justice and Reform\" in Islamabad. The event brings together senior government officials, human rights experts, members of the judiciary, and civil society representatives to discuss challenges in Pakistan's criminal justice system and identify pathways for inclusive, accountable, and rights-based reforms. The conference focuses on three critical areas, including law enforcement, the judiciary, and the penal system, and will explore ways to make these systems more responsive and fairer, particularly for vulnerable groups such as women, juveniles, and minorities. Dr. Riina Kionka, Ambassador of the European Union, commended the NCHR for convening this important and timely dialogue. \"Now more than ever, the world needs National Human Rights Institutions to play their human rights watchdog role to the fullest. The real measure of our commitment to human rights lies not in our words, but in the impact of our actions. The European Union will remain a steadfast supporter to accompany your efforts in ensuring justice, rule of law, and fundamental rights for all in Pakistan.\" NCHR Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha highlighted the importance of collective action in advancing justice sector reform. \"Governments alone cannot create justice. Civil society alone cannot ensure accountability. Donors alone cannot reform institutions,\" she said. \"But together, through strategic collaboration, we can dismantle barriers to justice.\" The event aligns Pakistan's criminal justice reform agenda with Sustainable Development Goal 16, the GSP+ Scheme, and core international human rights treaties. Following NCHR's A status accreditation, Pakistan has fulfilled its commitment under SDG 16.A.1. The conference aims to build on this momentum by addressing the remaining gaps in achieving SDG 16. Through case studies and panel discussions, participants will examine key challenges such as pre-trial detention, legal delays, systemic bias, and barriers to justice for the most marginalized. Minister of State for Interfaith Harmony, Kesoo Mal Kheal Das, emphasized the importance of inclusive justice, stating: \"True justice is not merely the absence of crime or punishment, but by the presence of fairness, the protection of human dignity, and the guarantee of equal rights for all citizens, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or social background.\" Dr. Samuel Rizk, UNDP Resident Representative, emphasized the need to implement and scale innovative approaches to justice delivery. \"We must recognize the transformative potential of digital solutions like virtual courts, digital case management, and online legal aid,\" he said. \"UNDP's support in establishing virtual courts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan led to a 130 percent increase in case hearings in KP this year alone. This momentum must continue alongside people-centered reforms.\" Supported by the European Union and UNDP Pakistan through the Huqooq-e-Pakistan II project, the conference will conclude today with six thematic sub-working groups expected to develop concrete recommendations. These are set to focus on improving police response mechanisms, reducing case backlogs, expanding legal aid, protecting the rights of detainees, and making courts more accessible and survivor-centered, ensuring that no one is left behind.",
