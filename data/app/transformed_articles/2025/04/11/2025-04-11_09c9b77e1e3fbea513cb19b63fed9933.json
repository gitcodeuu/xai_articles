    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 11 (APP): In an era marked by geopolitical fragmentation and growing global challenges, the Antalya Diplomacy Forum 2025 emerges as a vital platform for dialogue, cooperation, and renewed international engagement. Held under the auspices of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and hosted by Turkiye's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the fourth edition of the Forum convenes over 4,000 global actors, including heads of state, ministers, and international leaders, to champion diplomacy as the cornerstone for peace, stability, and shared progress. The fourth edition of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum will take place from April 11 to 13 in Antalya, Turkiye, with the theme \"Reclaiming Diplomacy in a Fragmented World.\" According to a press release issued by the Turkish Embassy, this year's theme highlights the urgent need for dialogue-driven solutions to address global divisions and tensions. The Forum is expected to attract more than 4,000 participants, including over 20 heads of state and government, 70 ministers, and 60 high-ranking representatives from international organizations. It will feature more than 50 sessions, tackling a broad array of pressing issues such as climate change, counterterrorism, humanitarian aid, digitization, food security, and the growing influence of artificial intelligence. Distinguished global leaders will participate, including presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers from countries such as Azerbaijan, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Norway, Ukraine, Sudan, Libya, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Iraq. Representatives from Pakistan are also expected to attend, reflecting the strong bond between Pakistan and Turkiye. Their participation underscores the shared commitment of both nations to promoting peace, dialogue, and multilateral cooperation on the global stage. ADF2025 continues to position itself as a dynamic and inclusive diplomatic platform, where global leaders, policymakers, academics, and opinion shapers converge to tackle global crises through open dialogue and collective action.",
