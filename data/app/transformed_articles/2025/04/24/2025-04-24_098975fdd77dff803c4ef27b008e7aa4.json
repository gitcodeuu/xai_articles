    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 24 (APP):The National Assembly Standing Committee on Climate Change addressed urgent environmental challenges, including e-waste regulation, climate finance transparency, and urban waste management, during its 11th meeting on Thursday. Chaired by Munaza Hassan, the committee, reviewed the Pakistan Environmental Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aimed at managing electronic waste from devices like mobile phones and laptops. While the Ministry of Climate Change acknowledged gaps in e-waste policy, it warned against a blanket ban, stating it could harm industries reliant on recyclable imports. The Ministry of Law clarified that existing laws cover hazardous waste but agreed to refine the e-waste definition. On climate finance, the Finance Division outlined major agreements, including $500 million from the Asian Development Bank and $1.3 billion from the IMF. Chairperson Hassan stressed the need to prevent diversion of climate funds, to which officials assured reforms like \"green budget tagging\" to track spending. The Capital Development Authority (CDA) presented plans for a new landfill and waste segregation system in Islamabad but faced scrutiny over the lack of policies for medical and green waste. Meanwhile, the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board reported progress on demarcating Margalla Hills National Park, though concerns were raised over limited staffing and public awareness efforts. The meeting was attended by multiple MNAs, including virtual participants. The committee directed follow-ups on pending policies and enforcement measures.",
