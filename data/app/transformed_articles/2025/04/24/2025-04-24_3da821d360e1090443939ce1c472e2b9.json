    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 24 (APP):Federal Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety, Syed Imran Ahmad Shah, during his visit to the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) Headquarters on Thursday, reaffirmed his commitment to advancing BISP's mission of uplifting marginalized communities, with a particular focus on women empowerment. The minister was warmly received by BISP Chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid and Secretary Amer Ali Ahmad. In her welcome address, Senator Rubina Khalid highlighted BISP's transformational role in promoting socio-economic empowerment across Pakistan. She emphasized that the programme, envisioned by Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto during her exile in Dubai, was launched in 2008 by President Asif Ali Zardari to uphold her legacy. Senator Khalid noted that linking BISP benefits with the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) system has enabled over 10 million women to gain national recognition and access to social protection. She also spotlighted ongoing efforts such as the Benazir Hunarmand Programme, aimed at equipping beneficiaries with globally relevant technical skills. The Chairperson informed the minister about a forthcoming pilot project that would allow beneficiaries to open direct bank accounts in seven regions, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the State Bank of Pakistan, to enhance financial transparency and dignity. Speaking on the occasion, Syed Imran Ahmad Shah stressed the need for enhanced skill development and identified the lack of post-training engagement data for women as a critical gap. He suggested initiating MoUs with countries like Germany to facilitate skilled labor migration and emphasized streamlining the beneficiary registry to ensure timely assistance for those below the 32-score poverty threshold. Addressing concerns around corruption, the minister recommended surprise inspections and deeper coordination with provincial police departments to ensure transparency within the system. He lauded BISP's numerous initiatives and stressed the importance of raising awareness among beneficiaries to ensure maximum utilization of available services. Secretary BISP Amer Ali Ahmad briefed the minister on several flagship initiatives, including the New Payment Model, Hybrid Social Protection Scheme, Mobile Registration Vans, and the Nutrition Program for Adolescent Girls. He also highlighted BISP's proactive role in responding to emergencies and natural disasters. Earlier, Additional Secretary Dr. Tahir Noor presented a detailed overview of key programs such as Benazir Kafaalat, Benazir Taleemi Wazaif, Benazir Nashonuma, and the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER). The federal minister commended the impactful work being done under BISP and assured continued government support in ensuring the welfare of vulnerable populations, especially women.",
