    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 24 (APP):Minister of State for Law & Justice, Barrister Aqeel Malik, visited the International Mediation and Arbitration Centre (IMAC), an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Law & Justice. During the visit, the Registrar IMAC Ehsan Ullah Khan briefed the Minister on IMAC's mandate, activities, and strategic direction. Barrister Aqeel Malik emphasized that Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is no longer a choice but a necessity, particularly in view of the overwhelming backlog of cases in the country's courts. He noted that IMAC is poised to play a crucial role in facilitating efficient dispute resolution mechanisms, both domestically and internationally. Highlighting Pakistan's expanding trade relations with Central Asian states, Azerbaijan, Turkiye, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, the Minister stated that the demand for a robust institution like IMAC has grown significantly. He praised IMAC's nationwide awareness and training programs aimed at strengthening ADR capacity among legal professionals and stakeholders.",
