    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 24 (APP):Vice Chancellor, Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood has underscored the importance of a balanced approach to early childhood education, highlighting that learning should not be confined to academic assessments alone. He stressed that equal attention must be paid to children's social, emotional, and psychological development to build a solid foundation for their future. He made these remarks during the closing session of a seminar titled \"Foundational Learning Assessment in Pakistan: Challenges and Opportunities\" held at AIOU. Dr. Mahmood advocated for the creation of an \"enabling environment\" in schools, stating that educational reforms must go beyond academics to help nurture well-rounded, responsible citizens. \"Today's children are tomorrow's architects,\" he said, \"and their holistic development is essential for a brighter national future.\" The seminar was jointly organized by Allama Iqbal Open University and the Pakistan Institute of Education. The event aimed to evaluate the current landscape of foundational learning in Pakistan, identify key challenges, and explore avenues for improvement. During the opening session, Director General of the Pakistan Institute of Education, Dr. Muhammad Shahid Surayya, presented the National Education Assessment Report. He expressed optimism that the introduction of a new assessment policy would significantly enhance the overall quality of education in the country. Other prominent speakers included Azza Farukh from the World Bank, Prof. Dr. Adnan Zafar of LUMS University, and Dr. Abdullah Firdous, an education expert from the American Institute for Research. They shared in-depth analyses of the foundational education system in Pakistan, discussing critical issues such as educational equity, teacher training, infrastructure, and student inclusion. Speakers also stressed the importance of aligning assessment reforms with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG-4), which calls for inclusive and equitable quality education for all.",
