The delegation was warmly received by Pro-Rector Research, Innovation and Commercialisation (RIC), Dr Rizwan Riaz, who briefed the visitors on NUST's strong emphasis on international collaboration and its thriving ecosystem promoting academia-industry linkages. The delegation toured key facilities including the National Science and Technology Park (NSTP), where they engaged with startups and R&D firms working in AI, Cyber Security, and Ed-Tech. They also visited SINES - Pakistan's first interdisciplinary research cluster - and the Center of Emerging Technologies, which houses the National Center of AI. Both sides held in-depth discussions on future collaborations, focusing on innovation-driven initiatives. Mr Jie expressed keen interest in establishing concrete partnerships, particularly in cutting-edge areas such as 6G, Artificial Intelligence, and Supercomputing. Proposals for joint labs, research projects, and training programs were also tabled to develop a robust framework for cooperation. The visit marks a significant step towards strengthening Sino-Pak academic and technological ties through mutual collaboration and shared innovation goals.",
