In a statement, the prime minister, who is currently on a two-day visit to Turkiye, expressed grief over the martyrdom of the Levies personnel guarding the polio vaccination team. He prayed to Allah Almighty for peace for the departed souls and strength for the bereaved families to bear the loss. \"The terrorists causing harm to the lives and properties of innocent citizens will be brought to justice.
