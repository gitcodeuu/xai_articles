In his statement issued by the Ministry of Power Division here, the minister said, \"India's reckless suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is an act of water warfare; a cowardly, illegal move. Every drop is ours by right, and we will defend it with full force - legally, politically, and globally\".",
