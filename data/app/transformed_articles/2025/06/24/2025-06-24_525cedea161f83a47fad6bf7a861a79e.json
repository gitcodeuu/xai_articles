    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): In a historic achievement for Pakistan's transgender community, renowned activist Nayyab Ali has been appointed as a Global Human Rights Fellow at the prestigious Harvard Kennedy School's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. Nayyab's selection marks a significant milestone as she joins the cohort of eight distinguished global leaders, including former U.S. Special Envoy Jessica Stern. Her presence at one of the world's top universities is being hailed as a powerful step in projecting a positive and inclusive image of Pakistan on the global stage. During her one-year fellowship, Nayyab Ali will conduct research on human rights issues, with her policy paper expected to influence international policymaking. Her selection is being celebrated not only as a personal triumph but also as a beacon of hope and inspiration for the transgender community in Pakistan and beyond. Advocates believe her achievement demonstrates that with access to education and opportunities, transgender individuals can assume leadership roles on the world stage.",
