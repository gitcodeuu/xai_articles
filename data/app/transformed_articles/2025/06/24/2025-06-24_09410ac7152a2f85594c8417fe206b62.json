    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP):Helpline 1099, operated by the Ministry of Human Rights, received a total of 12,097 calls in May 2025, reflecting growing public engagement and awareness regarding human rights violations and legal redress in Pakistan. Out of the total, 443 cases were formally processed for service provision. Among them, 151 cases were disposed off with legal advice, 82 were referred to relevant authorities, 28 were instantly referred through the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit (PMDU), and 180 ZARRA (Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act) reminders were issued. Additionally, 2 cases were related to walk-in visitors or applications, and 31 calls were uploaded in the ZARRA system. The helpline also managed 288 follow-up or callback communications, ensuring continuity in response and resolution processes. Furthermore, 972 reminders were issued for ongoing or pending cases as part of a follow-up mechanism. In terms of gender breakdown, 120 callers were male, 93 were female, 1 was a transgender person, and 19 callers did not disclose their gender. The provincial distribution of cases shows a higher concentration of complaints from Punjab with 134 cases, followed by Islamabad with 35, Sindh with 31, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 17, province unspecified with 13, and Balochistan with 3 cases. No case was reported from Azad Kashmir. The main areas of concern recorded through the helpline include 111 cases related to women's rights, 42 cases linked to government or administrative issues, 26 related to men's rights, 15 to child rights, and 16 miscellaneous concerns. There were 8 complaints regarding the rights of persons with disabilities, 3 concerning transgender persons, 2 related to senior citizens, and one case each on the rights of missing persons, minorities' rights, rights to life, liberty and dignity, and overseas Pakistanis' rights. The overwhelming number of women rights-related calls highlights the continued need for targeted protections and support services for women across Pakistan. Simultaneously, cases involving men, children, the disabled, and transgender persons also indicate a diverse range of rights violations being reported. The use of digital platforms like PMDU for instant referrals and ZARRA for child alerts and recovery demonstrates a growing institutional effort toward integrating technology for timely justice delivery. The Ministry of Human Rights has reiterated its commitment to strengthening helpline services, raising awareness, and expanding legal aid access to vulnerable communities. Helpline 1099 remains a critical lifeline for citizens to report abuse, seek redress, and assert their constitutional rights across the country.",
