    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): Chairperson of the Parliamentary Forum on Population, Senator Sherry Rehman, delivered a compelling call to action at the 13th meeting of the Forum titled \"From Consensus to Action: Leveraging Parliamentary Support to Achieve Sustainable Population Growth.\" Addressing a room full of lawmakers, experts and development partners, she declared Pakistan's unchecked population growth \"a ticking time bomb that has been consistently placed on the back burner,\" said in a press release issued here on Tuesday. \"It's a structural burden - not a dividend,\" said Senator Rehman. \"We cannot ignore that our population has reached 241 million, with a fertility rate of 3.6 births per woman - among the highest in South Asia. We are the 5th most populous country in the world, but we're not investing enough in the people who make up that number.\" She warned that the growing crisis is pressing down on every household and every resource. \"We have more mouths to feed than families can afford. 40 percent of our children under five are stunted. Every 50 minutes, a woman in Pakistan dies during childbirth. These are not abstract numbers - they are daily tragedies unfolding across the country,\" she said. \"And yet, this issue is always sidelined, rarely receiving the attention or intervention it demands.\" Senator Rehman underscored how population growth is deeply interlinked with health, education, and economic stability. \"Population growth reduces per capita income - a 1% increase in population growth slashes PKR 35,000 annually from the average citizen's income. If we reduce fertility to 2.1 births per woman by 2030, per capita income could rise by 37%, and GDP growth could increase to 3.9% by 2033.\" She underscored the lack of embedded action, both at the national and local levels. \"There is a real gap between data and delivery,\" she said. \"The climate ministry had its budget cut, and we're seeing similar neglect when it comes to population issues. Our local governments are under pressure to provide basic services - clean water, health care, sanitation - yet the population keeps growing without support.\" Senator Rehman acknowledged the important role of provinces while noting the burden they face. \"Yes, provinces must lead implementation, but Parliament has to step up too. Parliament must become the fourth leg of this solution. When Parliament speaks, it gives legitimacy, visibility, and political will.\" Recognizing the efforts of development partners, she said, \"The Population Council, UNFPA, and UKAID have done critical work in providing us with evidence. To find solutions is our national responsibility. It demands a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.\" Sherry Rehman also stressed the need to challenge cultural taboos and normalize discourse on reproductive rights. \"We must stop letting culture muzzle rights,\" she said. \"Family planning is not just a health issue - it's a human right. It's about giving women the agency and power to make good choices - that lead to healthier children and stronger households.\" The Senator underscored the recent passage of the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill in the Senate, which raised the age of marriage from 16 to 18. \"This bill - which I first introduced in 2018 - is not just a legislative win, it's a moral and social victory,\" she said. \"Girls married too young are more likely to drop out of school, suffer domestic violence, and die from early pregnancies. We rank 6th in the world for the highest number of child marriages. This law gives our girls some agency - the right to education, to choose, and to live.\" She added that contraception and family planning remain underused tools. \"Only 34 percent of couples use contraception, while 17.3 percent have unmet needs. If we increase usage to 52 percent, we can prevent 3,800 maternal deaths and 140,000 infant deaths. That's the scale of what's possible.\" Calling on fellow lawmakers, she said, \"I urge you to take this issue to your constituencies. Women's representation matters, but so does educating families - especially men. This issue must be brought to the frontline of our political agendas. If it brings discomfort to others, don't hold back. This is about dignity, rights, and responsibility.\" Concluding her address, Sherry Rehman said, \"Let us not walk away from this moment thinking we've ticked a box. Let's take this momentum forward. Everyone here matters - as a single voice and as a collective voice. If we can move coordinated resolutions in both houses, it will be a powerful message that Pakistan is ready to face its future - with clarity, compassion, and courage.\"",
