    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): The federal capital currently lacks any operational government hostel for working women, a situation that has added to the challenges faced by female professionals in need of safe and affordable accommodation. According to an official source, the Nusrat Hostel in Sector G-6, which previously served as a residence for working women, was converted into a Girls Child Protection Center, which is also not functional at present. Similarly, the Staff Welfare Women Hostel in Sector G-7 was vacated approximately three months ago and has yet to be reopened. Working women posted in various government departments, healthcare institutions, and educational organizations have expressed concern over the lack of residential facilities in Islamabad. \"Affordable accommodation is a basic need. Without official hostels, we are left to search for expensive private options which are not always secure,\" said Sadia Khan, a schoolteacher from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \"Many of us come from distant areas and do not have relatives here. Every month, a major portion of our salaries is spent on rent, which makes it difficult to manage other expenses\", she said. Talking to. APP, Samina Ali, a junior government officer from Punjab, shared her concern saying, \"When I was transferred to Islamabad, I assumed there would be hostel support.

Farzana Bibi, a nurse working at a public hospital, noted, \"We work long shifts and need a safe place to rest. Living in shared private accommodations is neither ideal nor always safe.
