He rejected all motions moved by the opposition and defended the performance of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's cabinet. Dr. Fazal explained that under Article 92(1) of the Constitution, the federal cabinet cannot exceed 11% of the total National Assembly membership. \"The current cabinet has 42 members, which is four less than the allowed limit of 46,\" he said. He said that when the present government took office, Pakistan was facing a severe economic crisis and risked default. \"Today, economic indicators are stable, and key sectors are recovering,\" he stated. Dr. Fazal credited the government with reviving the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), introducing tax reforms, and promoting investment in sectors such as energy and agriculture. \"The energy sector has undergone major reforms, and initiatives in agriculture are effectively addressing long-standing challenges,\" he added. He also highlighted progress in the minerals and mining sectors, saying Pakistan has untapped resources worth trillions of dollars. \"The government is working with international partners to explore and develop these resources for national growth,\" he said.

He said that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has played a major role in attracting billions of dollars in foreign investment. \"The SIFC was created to remove hurdles in investment and ensure timely project implementation,\" he explained. Addressing concerns about the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Dr. Fazal said the authority is now fully operational across all provinces. \"There is proper leadership and coordination at both federal and provincial levels,\" he said, adding that the NDMA's work has earned praise from global partners. On the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), he said the federal government is actively implementing programs focused on infrastructure, education, healthcare, and climate action. \"We are working in line with international standards and expanding outreach to all provinces,\" he said. Regarding the stalled Naya Pakistan Housing Program, Dr. Fazal said five projects initiated under the previous government remain incomplete. \"Not a single one was finished during the PTI government. We are now working to resume and complete them,\" he said. He also explained that the Cabinet Division is responsible for civil awards, which are given based on merit in fields like science, education, literature, and social work. On tourism, Dr. Fazal acknowledged that it is a provincial subject but said the federal government is taking steps to promote it nationwide. \"Tourism has increased recently, and we are committed to improving services for local and international visitors,\" he added.",
