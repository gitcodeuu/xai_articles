The training was designed specifically for HEC and universities across Pakistan to create awareness, enhance capacity, and foster environmentally responsible practices in managing electronic waste. Executive Director HEC, Dr. Mazhar Saeed, attended the opening session as the chief guest. He emphasised the importance of effective knowledge of e-waste management. Expert trainers engaged for the activity shared detailed presentations on e-waste and its sustainable management, environmental impact, regulations, and international agreements. It also aimed at developing a deliberate collective effort in promoting sustainability and environmental stewardship across the higher education sector. It is pertinent to mention here that ICT equipment forms a major part of electrical and electronic waste, or e-waste, in any modern-day organisation, which needs to be properly handled.",
