    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): Federal Minister for Housing and Works Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada met with Alisher Tukhtaev, Ambassador of the Republic of Uzbekistan to Pakistan, at the Ministry of Housing and Works on Tuesday. The discussion focused on collaboration in housing and communal development, with both sides engaging in a constructive dialogue to explore potential areas of cooperation. They also deliberated on sustainable urban growth, paving the way for future partnerships between the two nations. The minister welcomed the Ambassador and appreciated Uzbekistan's fast-growing economy, acknowledging the potential for mutually beneficial cooperation, especially in view of Pakistan's rising housing needs and increasing water scarcity. He stressed the importance of adopting innovative and sustainable solutions, such as recycling, green construction practices, and resource-efficient urban development models. Ambassador Tukhtaev highlighted the deep-rooted cultural, religious, and historical ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan, and underscored Uzbekistan's expertise in areas critical to urban development. He noted that one of the key outcomes of the Tashkent meetings held in February 2025 was the establishment of a Joint Working Group on Housing and Communal Services. The ambassador elaborated on Uzbekistan's economic reforms, a notable increase in Foreign Direct Investment, and the ongoing transformation of its housing and construction sector. He expressed readiness to cooperate in training and capacity-building initiatives in housing development, water recycling, green housing, and social infrastructure. He also offered Uzbekistan's support in sharing models and experiences related to rainwater harvesting, high-rise construction, smart and green housing, and affordable housing for low-income groups. Moreover, the ambassador proposed policy collaboration and knowledge exchange in public procurement, legal and institutional reforms, and emerging construction trends, emphasizing Uzbekistan's willingness to share its technical expertise during a period of construction sector growth. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing bilateral cooperation, with a shared resolve to translate their longstanding diplomatic relations into practical economic and industrial partnerships in the housing and urban development sectors.",
