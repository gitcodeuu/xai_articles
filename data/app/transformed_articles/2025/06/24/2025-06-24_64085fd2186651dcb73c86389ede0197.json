    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): The lawmakers on Tuesday welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, hailing it as a critical step back from the brink of a global conflict and a potential turning point for peace in the Middle East. Speaking to media outside Parliament, at the same time, they expressed grave concern over the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, urging the global community to intervene with urgency and justice. Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir, Rana Muhammad Qasim Noon, underscored the urgent need for both regional and international peace. \"War is not the solution,\" he said. \"Diplomacy must prevail. If peace is to be lasting, violators of international borders must be held accountable without immunity.\" He emphasized that no nation's sovereignty should be compromised under the guise of aggression. Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) leader Mustafa Kamal described the ceasefire between Israel and Iran as a welcome move, but warned that unless Israel halts its relentless campaign of violence, the specter of war will continue to loom. \"More than 50,000 innocent children have been martyred in Gaza-this scale of genocide is unprecedented. Israel must stop,\" he stressed. Member of National Assembly Begum Tehmina Daultana commended Iran's measured response to Israel and said the international community, including the United Nations and global organizations, must play an effective role in conflict resolution. \"It is time for the Muslim world to unite and meet the challenges ahead collectively,\" she said. Echoing Pakistan's longstanding commitment to peace, MNA Syed Ali Qasim Gillani noted the proactive efforts of Pakistan on the international front, including diplomatic outreach by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. \"Pakistan's stance has always been one of peace,\" Gilani said. \"We welcome US President Donald Trump's call for a ceasefire and believe it aligns with Pakistan's vision for a peaceful Middle East. Such steps deserve international recognition, even a Nobel Peace Prize to Donald Trump if they bear fruit.\" Sher Afzal Marwat hailed the ceasefire as an \"Iran's people victory,\" emphasizing that the conflict is fundamentally about control over resources. \"Iran has endured decades of sanctions, yet it has shown immense resilience. The ceasefire is a commendable step forward,\" he noted. Senior politician Latif Khosa issued a strong warning that if Israeli aggression remains unchecked, Pakistan itself could become a target. \"Pakistan, as the only Muslim nuclear power, must stand firm. The US attack on Iran's nuclear facilities from thousands of miles away is a flagrant violation of international law. Fortunately, the world has stepped back from the brink of World War III,\" he added. MNA Sahar Kamran stressed the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and urged for greater Muslim solidarity. \"Innocent children are dying, food is scarce, and oppression is mounting. She said Iran's firm response has shifted the balance. The ceasefire is a positive development, but lasting peace depends on unity among Muslim nations.\"",
