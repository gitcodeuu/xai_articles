    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP):Chairperson Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid Tuesday said that President Asif Ali Zardari has turned the dream of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto into reality through the launch of the Benazir Hunarmand Program-a milestone that stands as a proud achievement for BISP. Addressing in a cake-cutting ceremony organized by BISP employees at the BISP Headquarters to mark the 72nd birthday of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, Senator Rubina Khalid paid rich tributes to the iconic leader, calling her vision and courage a guiding force for the institution. \"Through BISP, we have worked to make the lives of deserving individuals easier. Now, with the Benazir Hunarmand Program, we aim to improve their quality of life and empower them to become self-reliant,\" she said. \"If we fulfill this noble mission with sincerity, the gates of heaven will open for us\", she said. She emphasized the need to instill confidence among the most deserving women of society, ensuring they are not subjected to fear or exploitation. \"We must work together to counter negative perceptions, address complaints effectively, and build an environment where no injustice is tolerated,\" she asserted. Calling the BISP team a united family with a shared purpose, she said every initiative-especially the newly launched Hunarmand Program-must be transformed into a success story. Paying tribute to Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Senator Rubina Khalid said, \"Leaders are not merely made-they are born. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is a living example of this truth.\" She praised his fearless leadership, global recognition, and powerful representation of Pakistan's stance on international forums, describing him as a proud reflection of the legacy of both Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Earlier, Sardar Azmat, President of the BISP Officers Association, and Sardar Shiraz, President of the All Pakistan BISP Employees Welfare Association, also addressed the gathering and shared their thoughts on the occasion. The event concluded with Senator Rubina Khalid and BISP staff jointly cutting the birthday cake in honour of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, reaffirming their dedication to her mission of empowerment and social justice.",
