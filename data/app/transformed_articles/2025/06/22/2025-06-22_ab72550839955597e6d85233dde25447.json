    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 22 (APP): A legal dispute involving the freezing of properties of Banking Society has taken a new turn after a court issued arrest warrants for the Islamabad Deputy Commissioner (DC) Irfan Nawaz Memon. The warrants were reportedly issued after a revenue officer failed to appear in court despite being informed of a previous order concerning property seizures linked to a banking society case. According to details, the court issued arrest warrants for the Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Islamabad after directions regarding property freezing in a 2024 case were not implemented in full. The issue dates back to September 30, 2024, when a court ordered the freezing of properties connected to the Bankers Society. These properties were located in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Haripur. On March 26, 2025, the court directed the Deputy Commissioners of the three districts to act as receivers of the identified properties. The formal orders were sent to the DCs of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Haripur, giving them the legal authority to take control of the assets in their respective jurisdictions. However, sources said that during a court hearing held in June, the revenue officer responsible for handling the Islamabad part of the case did not appear, reportedly due to illness. The court was officially informed about the officer's health condition and his inability to attend the proceedings. Despite the explanation, the court responded by issuing arrest warrants for the DC Islamabad, holding the office accountable for the revenue officer's absence. The sources further explained that in revenue-related matters, the DC Islamabad holds the same administrative rank as the Commissioners of Rawalpindi and Hazara divisions. In Rawalpindi and Haripur, the court's orders were directly addressed to the respective DCs, while in Islamabad, the instructions were received by the Commissioner Revenue. Sources added that just like the DCs in the other districts, in Islamabad the responsibility for implementing such orders rests with the concerned Collector Revenue, not necessarily the DC himself. In the next hearing, a Naib Tehsildar (sub-divisional revenue officer) is expected to submit a report to the court, providing an update on the implementation status of the property freezing directive and any progress made in assigning control to government officials. The court's decision to escalate the matter to issuing warrants signals the seriousness of the delay in implementing the order. Further action is expected after the court reviews the Naib Tehsildar's report in the upcoming hearing.",
