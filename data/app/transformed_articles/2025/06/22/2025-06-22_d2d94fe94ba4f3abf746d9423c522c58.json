    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 22 (APP): The Islamabad Food Authority (IFA) has conducted an operation at ketchup production unit located on Lehtrar Road and over 1,000 kilograms of substandard ketchup was destroyed after discovering expired ingredients, safety violations, and unhygienic conditions. Talking to APP, Deputy Director Operations of IFA, Dr Tahira Siddique said that the factory, located in the Tarlai area of Islamabad, was raided by the food authority teams following repeated warnings and non-compliance with food safety regulations. She said that the unit was storing pulp at room temperature without following proper storage standards. The inspection team also found several expired food items on the premises. Dr. Tahira Siddique said the ketchup was being produced using low-quality materials. During the inspection, the team could not find any certification for the chemicals used in the production of various food items. She further revealed that the workers at the unit were not wearing uniforms and had ignored standard safety procedures. The factory floor was found in an unsanitary condition. Standing water was observed, and food products were stored directly on the floor, violating hygiene rules. During the operation, 150 kilograms of expired pulp and 10 kilograms of trisodium citrate were confiscated and destroyed. A total of 1,000 kilograms of substandard ketchup was also disposed of. The food authority officials confirmed that the factory was sealed to prevent further production and distribution of unsafe food products. The action was part of IFA's ongoing efforts to monitor food safety standards in the federal capital and ensure compliance from local manufacturers. Authorities have warned other factories and food units to follow proper regulations or face similar action.",
