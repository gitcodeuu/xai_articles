    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 22 (APP): As Islamabad faces yet another punishing heatwave with afeels likea temperatures soaring to 50AC, the cityas shrinking tree cover is turning entire sectors into heat traps. In neighborhoods where mature trees still stand, residents find some refuge from the scorching sunabut in many areas, the absence of shade is making life unbearable. The capitalas changing climate is no longer a warningaitas a lived reality, demanding urgent action from both the civic authorities and the citizens. In areas like F-6 and parts of E-7, mature treesasuch as neem, peepal, bohar, and amaltasado more than beautify the streets. They lower temperatures, allow for breezes, and make it possible for residents to sit outdoors even during scorching afternoons. But the situation changes dramatically in places like G-6, G-7, G-13, and G-14. Here, tree cover is sparse or consists of younger trees that provide minimal cooling. aThe streets feel like ovens,a said Kamran Khan, a G-6 resident. aThe sun burns from above, and the heat radiates from below. Thereas no escape.a Islamabad urgently needs thousands of new treesaespecially in rapidly urbanizing sectors like G-13, G-14, the H-sectors, and Bhara Kahu. But not just any treesathe city needs native, climate-resilient species that provide real shade and cooling benefits. aTrees are no longer a luxuryatheyare a necessity,a said Noreen, a resident of G-7. aIf we want to survive these summers, we need shade, not just more concrete.a One major misstep has been the widespread planting of safeda (eucalyptus) trees. Though they grow quickly, these trees are now criticized for consuming vast amounts of groundwater, providing little shade, and leaving the ground warmer. aIt might grow fast, but it gives back very little,a wrote one concerned citizen on Facebook. aWe need trees that help the environment, not just fill space.a Environmental expert Nasir Ali Panhwar warns of worsening urban heat island effects in fast-growing cities like Islamabad. He stresses the importance of nature-based solutions, including extensive tree plantation and green infrastructure like green roofs and vertical gardens. aThese not only cool urban areas but also restore biodiversity and improve air quality,a he explained. The climate threat is growing, compounded by rapid urbanization and unchecked population growth. According to Global Forest Watch, Pakistan lost 5.35 thousand hectares of tree cover to fires and 4.19 thousand hectares to other causes between 2001 and 2024. Alarmingly, in just one week, from June 8 to June 15, 2025, 2,587 fire alerts were recorded across the country. This marks a steep rise compared to previous years. Under the leadership of Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has launched an ambitious tree-planting campaign, aiming to plant one million trees during the Spring and Monsoon seasons of 2025. But experts caution that planting alone isnat enough, itas about planting the right trees in the right places. Naseer Memon, a leading voice on climate change and urban planning, paints a grim picture: aOur cities are fast becoming mini-hells. Green belts are disappearing, replaced by unchecked infrastructure. Vehicular emissions and overuse of air conditioning are creating hot islands across urban Pakistan.a Memon calls for aggressive social forestry measures, enforced by building control agencies. aEvery new structure should be mandated to plant and nurture trees until they reach maturity,a he said. aCosmetic plantation drives wonat solve the problem. Trees are a nature-based solution to improving microclimates in cities exposed to severe and frequent heatwaves.a When Islamabad was established in the late 1960s, it was planned as a green city surrounded by forests, with nearly two-thirds of its land covered by trees. Over the decades, rapid urban growth and development have reduced this tree cover dramatically. Today, less than one-third of the cityas original forest area remains, making the loss of greenery a visible and urgent challenge for the capitalas climate and livability. As Islamabad continues to expand, experts and residents alike are calling for smarter urban forestry strategies. Planting native, climate-adapted trees is not just about comfort, itas about survival, in the face of escalating climate change and global warming.",
