An official told APP that the purpose of these measures was to protect citizens from traffic jams and ensure an organized traffic system around the bazaars. In this regard, senior officers visited the bazaars, assessed the traffic flow, and briefed traffic personnel to perform their duties efficiently.

Traffic police personnel have been deployed at all entry and exit points, parking areas, and sensitive locations to prevent any kind of disorder or obstruction. Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (retd) Syed Zeeshan Haider, appealed to the citizens to park their vehicles only in designated parking areas so that traffic flow is not disrupted.
