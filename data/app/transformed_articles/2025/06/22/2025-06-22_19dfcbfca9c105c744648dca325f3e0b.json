    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 22 (APP): In a city often plagued by traffic congestion, unreliable public transport, and rising fuel costs, Islamabad residents are turning to an unconventional yet effective solution: WhatsApp carpooling groups. These community-driven chat groups are quietly transforming daily commutes and long-distance travel alike, offering both drivers and passengers a smarter way to move. More than just a ride-sharing tool, these groups are becoming a symbol of digital solidarity. From office commutes to weekend trips to Swat or Murree, members post their travel plans with simple messages like, \"Leaving for Lahore at 9 a.m. tomorrow - two seats available,\" or \"Need a ride to Faisalabad this Friday.\" Responses are swift, and the arrangement is usually settled in minutes. One active user, Shan Ali Khan, an engineer, shared his experience: \"Carpooling has reduced my monthly travelling cost from Rs60,000 to Rs20,000. Through the WhatsApp group, I now have regular co-riders who split the cost, offer great company, and even take over the driving at times. It's a win-win situation.\" Another member, Zarak Khan, a civil servant, recalled last Eid ul Azha: \"There was a chaotic situation at bus stations, with overcharging at its peak. I got a seat in a taxi for Rs6,000. Minutes before departure, I found a ride in a luxury car through a WhatsApp group with Dr. Sadiq - it cost me just Rs1,500, and it turned out to be one of the finest journeys of my life.\" But the scope of these groups goes beyond just long-distance travel. Local carpooling for daily office routes within Islamabad and Rawalpindi is equally popular. Many professionals find this more reliable than waiting for cabs or struggling with overbooked ride-hailing apps during rush hours. Muhibullah, a development activist and admin of the Swat-Islamabad Carpooling WhatsApp group - which now has over a thousand members - said the idea struck him after a frustrating experience: \"I waited over two hours for a bus at Chungi No. 26 and then had to travel standing for over 90 minutes to Swat. That's when I realized we needed a better system.\" Another regular user, Dr. Majid Ali Khan, emphasized the social aspect: \"Carpooling doesn't just save money - it offers opportunities for networking. I've made so many friends this way: doctors, engineers, professionals, and especially students.\" Environmentalists also praise the trend. \"Carpooling reduces the number of vehicles on the road, which means lower emissions and less congestion,\" noted Tariq Khan, CEO of Clean and Green Pakistan. Of course, challenges remain. Concerns about safety, coordination, and lack of regulation do arise. Admins often play a vital role in managing trust, setting rules, and removing problematic members. As these groups grow, some users have begun calling for light government oversight or community-created safety guidelines, especially to support women participants. Despite these hurdles, WhatsApp carpooling continues to thrive - not because of big tech but because of ordinary citizens choosing to help each other move better. In a time when fuel prices are rising and public transport remains inconsistent, carpooling is more than just convenient - it's a community-powered solution. So if you're tired of expensive rides, long waits, or solo drives, maybe it's time to join a WhatsApp carpooling group - and discover how a simple message can lead to smarter, friendlier, and more sustainable travel.",
