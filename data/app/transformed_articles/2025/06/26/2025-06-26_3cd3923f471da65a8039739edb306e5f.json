    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Thursday issued a clarification regarding viral social media clips showing a damaged slip road near the Jinnah Square Interchange. The civic body confirmed that all main structures, loops, and operational sections of the interchange remain fully intact and functional. The minor issue stemmed from water seepage near Sui gas trenches along a small isolated slip road, which was promptly repaired by the contractor following heavy rainfall. CDA emphasized that the repair work, conducted under the contractor's two-year defect liability period, was completed at no cost to the authority. The quick resolution reaffirms compliance with quality standards, ensuring public safety and infrastructure durability. Officials urged citizens to rely on official statements and avoid misinformation circulating on social media platforms.",
