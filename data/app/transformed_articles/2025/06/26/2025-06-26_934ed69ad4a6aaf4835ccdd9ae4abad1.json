    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): A man and his 12-year-old son lost their lives, while three women sustained injuries when a cemented utility pole collapsed onto a moving car on IJP Road near the Carriage Factory on Thursday afternoon. An official told APP that the incident occurred at around 2:40 PM when a Suzuki Mehran (registration number GAF-4550), reportedly associated with the Al Huda Foundation for student transport, was traveling along the busy road. A heavy cemented pole, believed to be part of the electrical infrastructure, suddenly toppled over, crushing the front portion of the vehicle. He said Rasheed, son of Niaz, aged approximately 50, and his son Muhammad Bin Amir, aged around 12, both residents of Rawalpindi, were seated in the front seats and died on the spot due to the impact. He said three female passengers sitting in the rear suffered minor injuries. Rescue 1122 personnel, assisted by local police, reached the site promptly, retrieved the injured, and shifted them to a nearby hospital, where their condition was reported to be stable. He said preliminary investigations suggest that the pole may have weakened due to recent heavy rainfall and water-logging, which compromised its foundation. SP Industrial Area immediately took notice of the incident and directed legal action under the relevant provisions of law. Authorities have also been instructed to inspect surrounding infrastructure to ensure public safety. He urged the public to avoid standing near utility poles and electric structures, especially during the ongoing monsoon season, and report any signs of structural weakness to the concerned departments.",
