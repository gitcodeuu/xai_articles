    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, June 26 (APP): The Federal Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Thursday officially announced the commencement of the Islamic New Year, following the sighting of the Muharram-ul-Haram moon. According to a notification issued by the ministry, the announcement came in line with the decision of the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, which convened earlier in Quetta to observe the new moon. The committee confirmed that the crescent marking the beginning of Muharram 1447 AH has been sighted. Consequently, the first day of Muharram-ul-Haram 1447 AH will fall on Friday, June 27, 2025, marking the start of the new Islamic year for Muslims across Pakistan. Muharram is the first month of the Islamic lunar calendar and holds profound religious significance, particularly for commemorating the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and the tragedy of Karbala.",
