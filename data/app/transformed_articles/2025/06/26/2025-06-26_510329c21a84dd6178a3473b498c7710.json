    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): Secretary of the Ministry of Human Rights, Abdul Khalique Shaikh, on Thursday described Pakistan's 148th position in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2025 as a \"wake-up call,\" and stressed the need for collective resolve to foster a more inclusive, gender-equal society. Speaking as the Guest of Honour at the 'National Dialogue on Spotlight on the Global Gender Gap Report 2025 - Facts, Ground Realities, and the Way Forward (2026)', Shaikh expressed deep concern over the country's 148th ranking out of 148 nations. \"It's not just a statistic - it's a moment for self-reflection,\" he remarked. The event was organized by National Commission on Status of Women (NCSW). Emphasizing introducing reforms over denial to the report, he noted the report should serve as a catalyst for introspection, and called for homegrown strategies to tackle gender disparities, particularly in economic participation and political representation. \"Rather than racing to meet external standards, we must define and commit to our own vision of equality,\" he said. Shaikh pointed to encouraging trends, including an increase in women's representation in the civil services, now at 48%, and the influential role of women legislators, who have led 55% of Parliament's agenda in recent sessions. These milestones, he suggested, could pave the way for gradually retiring gender-based quotas. He also reaffirmed the ministry's commitment to protecting vulnerable groups and highlighted several women-centric projects in pipeline, or nearing completion across the country. \"There is no need for despair - there is room for change, and the work is already underway,\" he concluded.",
