    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Thursday welcomed the federal government's inclusion of his party major proposals in the budget for fiscal year 2025-26, expressing appreciation for the coalition's focus on public relief and social welfare. Speaking in the National Assembly, PPP he praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government for increasing a record 20 percent increase in the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), calling it a \"commendable step\" and a clear reflection of the government's commitment to social protection. Bilawal highlighted that, following the PPP's persistent advocacy, the government had raised the annual income tax exemption limit for salaried individuals from Rs600,000 to Rs1.2 million-a move he described as a major relief for the middle class. He also credited PPP's active role in securing a 50 percent reduction in proposed taxes on solar panels, terming it a \"significant achievement\" that would benefit households and promote clean energy. The party, he said, would support the passage of the budget in view of these and other pro-people reforms. The PPP chairman further said that the party had successfully pushed for amendments to restrict the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) powers of arrest. He explained that under the revised provisions, arrest powers could only be exercised after the conclusion of inquiries specifically involving sales tax fraud-ensuring stronger checks and accountability within the tax system. Bilawal expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb for accepting the majority of PPP's recommendations, especially those aimed at easing the burden on the salaried class and ensuring economic justice. He reaffirmed that the PPP's support for the federal budget was rooted in its public-focused agenda. \"Our commitment is to ensure that every budgetary decision serves the national interest and prioritizes the welfare of ordinary citizens,\" he added.",
