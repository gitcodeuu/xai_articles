    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): Professor Athar ul Islam has officially taken charge as the new Principal of Islamabad Model Postgraduate College (IMPC), H-8. Prior to this, he served as Principal of Islamabad Model College for Boys, F-10/4. The staff of IMPC H-8 gave him a warm welcome and expressed hope that his dynamic leadership will bring positive academic and administrative reforms. They are particularly optimistic that the declining performance of the intermediate classes will improve under his guidance and vision. They voiced their hope that the college, once considered a best institution, would regain its lost stature. Muhammad Imran, the college librarian, noted that Professor Athar ul Islam immediately visited the campus after assuming office, reflecting his interest and commitment to improving the institution and promoting education. Senior faculty member Professor Tahir Mahmood talking to APP remarked, \"There is a substantial need for multidimensional reforms to enhance the college's academic performance and discipline. I also hope he will take steps to reopen the college cafeteria, which has been closed for more than a year. We expect that the new Principal will bring about essential changes for the betterment of students.\"",
