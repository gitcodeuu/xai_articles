    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP):On the occasion of the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, Federal Minister for Interior and Narcotics Control Mohsin Naqvi delivered a strong and resolute message, highlighting Pakistan's unwavering commitment to combating the growing menace of drug use and smuggling. In his official statement, the minister emphasized the need for global cooperation and national unity in creating a drug-free society. \"The growing threat of drug abuse has become a serious challenge for every society around the world,\" Naqvi stated. \"The international community must come together and take coordinated action to halt the spread of this destructive trend.\" He reiterated that Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community in this critical fight, having undertaken robust measures under the country's National Anti-Narcotics Policy. \"Pakistan has implemented comprehensive steps to counter both drug consumption and trafficking,\" he said, praising the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) for its pivotal role. Naqvi commended the dedication and sacrifices of ANF officers and personnel, many of whom have laid down their lives in the line of duty to protect future generations. \"The efforts of ANF are nothing short of heroic. We honor the memory of those brave individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of a drug-free society,\" he said, adding that the nation collectively salutes its martyrs, whose blood has become a symbol of Pakistan's resolve. Stressing the importance of a united front, the minister said, \"Winning the war against drugs requires a joint effort-every segment of society must play its part. Only through solidarity and shared responsibility can we overcome this challenge.\" Naqvi asserted that a drug-free society is the rightful inheritance of the youth and vowed that the government will ensure this right is upheld. He did not mince words when it came to drug traffickers, calling them the \"worst enemies of humanity and the youth\" and pledging that those responsible will be brought to justice and made \"a symbol of disgrace.\" In conclusion, the minister called upon the nation to renew its commitment to building a healthier, drug-free future. \"Let us reaffirm our determination to strengthen our efforts and contribute to the creation of a society free from drug abuse and smuggling,\" he said. The message comes as Pakistan continues to engage in regional and international partnerships aimed at disrupting narcotics networks and promoting rehabilitation, education, and prevention strategies. With its national resolve and active enforcement, Pakistan remains a key player in the global war on drugs.",
