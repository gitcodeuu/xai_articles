    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police have finalized an extensive security plan for Muharram-ul-Haram, deploying over 16,000 personnel to ensure the safety of 181 religious gatherings (Majalis) and 965 processions across the federal capital. A public relations officer told APP on Thursday that the plan was formally approved by Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, after a detailed review, while DIG Muhammad Jawad Tariq has been tasked with supervising its implementation. He said that over 16,000 personnel from Islamabad Police, Pakistan Rangers, Lady Police, Traffic Police, and the Special Branch will be deployed to maintain law and order during the month of Muharram. The security deployment aims to ensure the peaceful conduct of 181 Majalis and 965 processions scheduled in various sectors of Islamabad. DIG Tariq has issued strict directions to all Zonal SPs, SDPOs, and SHOs to maintain close liaison with the organizers of Majalis and peace committees. They have been instructed to ensure cooperation in maintaining security and to secure the routes of all processions. He said that walkthrough gates and metal detectors will be installed at the entry and exit points of all Majalis and processions, while participants will be professionally checked by police officials. Peace committees have been asked to assist in identifying participants and ensuring no unknown persons are allowed to stay inside worship places. DIG Tariq emphasized the importance of clearing bushes and improving lighting arrangements around worship places, in coordination with relevant departments. Patrolling has also been enhanced, and commando vehicles will be deployed in sensitive areas. DIG said that special focus will be placed on traffic arrangements to ensure smooth vehicular flow across the city. Parking areas will be set up at a safe distance from the main procession routes, with strict security checks in place. DIG Tariq said that rooftops of buildings along procession routes will be covered by police officials, while special arrangements have been made for female gatherings with the deployment of Lady Police officers. Volunteers assisting in security duties will be registered with complete biodata collected by local SHOs. DIG said that additional deployment of Rangers and elite commandos will be made at sensitive Imambargahs, which will remain on high alert. Rope lines will be used to secure processions from all directions. He said that strict measures have also been directed to prevent wall chalking, display of illegal posters, and the distribution of any material that could incite sectarian tension. DIG Tariq said that the Islamabad Police will perform their duties with full dedication and professionalism to ensure the safety of citizens and the peaceful observance of Muharram-ul-Haram rituals.",
