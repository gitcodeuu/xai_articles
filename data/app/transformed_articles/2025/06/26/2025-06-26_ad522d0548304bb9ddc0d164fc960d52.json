    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has commended the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for its unprecedented performance during the fiscal year 2023-24, highlighting record-breaking direct and indirect recoveries amounting to Rs. 5311 billion (approximately USD 18.6 billion) between October and December 2023. During a meeting with NAB Chairman Lt. Gen (R) Nazir Ahmed Butt at the Parliament House, the Speaker praised NAB's transformation into a fair, efficient, apolitical, and credible institution. He said that no other anti-corruption agency in the world has achieved recoveries of such magnitude, describing it as a testament to NAB's strengthened institutional integrity and operational reforms. Ayaz Sadiq also expressed satisfaction over the significant structural and technological reforms undertaken by NAB. He appreciated the agency's austerity measures, complete digitalization through AI-driven systems, and the establishment of Special Accountability Facilitation Desks across all provinces to support a business-friendly environment. Ayaz Sadiq lauded NAB's efforts to streamline its complaint handling process, modernize its investigation regime, and contribute positively to the country's economic stability. Nazir Ahmed thanked the National Assembly Speaker for his encouraging remarks and reaffirmed his commitment to transforming NAB into a model anti-corruption body. Deputy Chairman NAB, Sohail Nasir was also present during the meeting.",
