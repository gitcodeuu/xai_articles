The lawmakers shared their views while speaking to PTV News outside the Parliament House on Thursday. Dr. Shaista Jadoon, MNA from PML-N, called the initiative timely and important. \"This university will help in research on global warming, which is a serious issue for the entire world,\" she said. Syed Aminul Haq, MNA from MQM, praised the government's broader climate policies. \"Efforts like emission control, promotion of green energy, and support for electric vehicles will play a key role in fighting climate change,\" he said. Malik Shakir Bashir, MNA, said the government cannot do it alone. \"Every section of society needs to come forward and support the fight against climate change,\" he urged. The lawmakers noted that one of the main goals of the Green University is to involve young people in climate action. They said this step would help prepare the next generation to deal with future environmental challenges.
