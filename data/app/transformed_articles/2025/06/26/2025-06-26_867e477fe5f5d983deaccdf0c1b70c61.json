    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP)::The Director General of the Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL), Sultan Muhammad Nawaz Nasir, on Thursday, acknowledging social media's role for preserving Pakistan's endangered indigenous languages like Yidgha, Wakhi, Burushaski, Brahui and others, said, \"It is the most relevant platform to preserve country's rich linguistic mosaic.\" According to the latest data from Ethnologue, there are approximately 7,159 living languages worldwide. However, 75% of the global population communicates using just 20 languages. In Pakistan alone, around 80 languages are spoken, including 68 indigenous and 12 non-indigenous ones. While Urdu is the national language and English a co-official one, regional languages remain a vital part of the country's cultural identity. Languages like Wakhi, Burushaski, Brahui and others are at risk. However, community-driven efforts are helping to preserve them. For example, the Wakhi Culture Association is using radio, social media, and cultural events to promote the language. Wakhi speakers, known as Xik, maintain a strong cultural identity across borders-from China's Tashkurghan to Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor. Burushaski, a language isolate with no known relatives, is spoken in the Hunza, Nagar, and Yasin valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. Its speakers are increasingly turning to platforms like Facebook and TikTok to share content, promote cultural pride and keep the language alive. A 2020 article titled \"Challenges and Opportunities for Brahui Journalism in Balochistan\" emphasized the role of digital media in connecting people globally. Experts noted that blogs, websites, and other user-generated content platforms provide opportunities for self-expression and cultural preservation. Sonaina Hamiya, who was graduated from the National College of Arts (NCA) belongs Hunza, designed Burushaski alphabets for her thesis on preserving the language. She noted that many young Burusho, especially in cities, are shifting to dominant languages. Her work aimed to creatively preserve Burushaski by making it accessible and relevant to younger generations. Internationally, digital campaigns like Chile's Kimeltuwe, which promotes Mapuche culture and has over 216,000 Facebook followers, show how social media can revitalize languages. In Pakistan, similar initiatives like the Youth Engagement and Resilience Initiative (YERI) are building digital literacy, promoting online safety, and incorporating indigenous languages into peacebuilding efforts. PAL is actively using its own digital platforms to highlight such initiatives and raise awareness about endangered languages. Through e-learning and social media, youth are being empowered to celebrate diversity, counter hate speech, and become responsible digital citizens, while also helping preserve Pakistan's linguistic heritage. UNESCO warns that over 40% of the world's 7,000 languages are at risk of disappearing. Languages like Naiki (10,000 speakers), Phalura (8,600), and others with just a handful of speakers, such as Juma (5) and Yuchi (4), are facing extinction, threatening to take centuries of cultural traditions with them. Experts and organizations like PAL stress that preserving language is preserving identity. With sustained commitment and digital innovation, Pakistan's rich linguistic mosaic, and that of the world, can still be protected for future generations.",
