    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):The China-Pakistan TVET Industrial Center of Excellence (CPTICE) hosted an event at the Government College of Technology, Kareemabad, Karachi, titled \"Deepening Educational Cooperation and Advancing the Localization of Chinese Language Education.\" This gathering was jointly organized by TANG International Education and Technology and the Government College of Technology, Kareemabad, and is part of a broader commitment to youth development and academic collaboration under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The event was attended by Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training, Dr. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, as Chief Guest. Addressing the audience, Federal Minister emphasised the need for transformation through self-empowerment, stating, \"Only those nations that change have the power to change themselves.\" He highlighted the double-edged nature of modern technological advancement, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), which he said would both create and eliminate jobs in the near future. Dr. Siddiqui further elaborated on Pakistan's youth bulge, calling it a potential national asset that must be strategically utilized through education, skills training, and targeted opportunities. He also made a passionate appeal for gender equality, stating, \"Women are a very important part of this society and should be provided with equal opportunities. They must not be suppressed due to misinterpretations of religion by those lacking true understanding.\" The event aimed at promoting the localization of Chinese language education and the expansion of skill development programs. These efforts aim to prepare Pakistan's workforce for the evolving regional job market and strengthen bilateral cooperation in education and technology. As a gesture of appreciation, the Principal of Government College of Technology, Kareemabad, presented a commemorative souvenir to Dr. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, acknowledging his valuable presence and continued support for educational progress in Pakistan.",
