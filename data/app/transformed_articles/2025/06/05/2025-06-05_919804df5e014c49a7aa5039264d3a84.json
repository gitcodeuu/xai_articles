    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 5 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday calling the plastic pollution an environmental challenge threatening ecosystems, economy, and future generations, reaffirmed his government's commitment to eco-friendly policies, responsible consumption, and stricter plastic regulations. \"Real change begins with each of us - in our homes, our communities, and our choices,\" the prime minister said in his message on World Environment Day, annually observed on June 5. He said that on the Day, Pakistan joined the international community in reaffirming its commitment to safeguard our planet and pursue sustainable development. The prime minister said that this year's theme - \"Putting an End to Plastic Pollution\" - was both timely and urgent. \"Plastic pollution is an environmental challenge that threatens our ecosystems, our economy, and future generations. From choking our rivers and seas to harming marine life and contaminating our food chain, plastic waste has reached alarming levels across the globe - and Pakistan is no exception. This calls for a bold and collective action,\" he remarked. He said that the Day should serve as a reminder of our shared responsibility - to ourselves and to the generations yet to come.",
