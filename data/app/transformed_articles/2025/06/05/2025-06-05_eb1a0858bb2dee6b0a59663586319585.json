    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP): As Eid-ul-Azha approaches, the Islamabad district administration has chalked out a comprehensive plan to ensure timely disposal of animal waste and maintain cleanliness during the three-day festival. In this regard, the Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Islamabad chaired a meeting to review preparations for sanitation during Eid-ul-Azha. Assistant Commissioners and magistrates from across the district participated in the session to discuss practical steps for waste management during the eid holidays. The meeting focused on how to efficiently collect and dispose of animal remains, especially during the peak days of Eid when a large number of sacrificial animals are slaughtered. The administration is aiming to prevent waste from piling up in streets and open spaces. Officials reviewed the availability of resources for the clean-up drive, including staff, vehicles, and waste disposal materials. The goal is to maintain basic sanitation across all Union Councils (UCs) of Islamabad throughout the Eid holidays. DC Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon emphasized that all available resources will be used to keep the city clean during and after the Eid celebrations. He directed the teams to be present in the field and coordinate closely with local representatives. To assist in proper waste disposal, the administration will distribute biodegradable bags to citizens. These bags will help in storing animal waste before collection by sanitation teams. The district administration hopes this step will reduce the chances of waste being thrown in open areas or near residential streets. A control room will be established to monitor the clean-up operation. It will remain active throughout Eid to ensure quick response in case of complaints. Citizens will be able to contact the control room to report unattended waste or delays in waste collection. DC Memon also appealed to the public to play their part by cooperating with the sanitation teams. He urged residents to use the biodegradable bags for animal waste and to inform the authorities if garbage is not collected in time. Public awareness campaigns will be launched before Eid to share these instructions with households. According to district officials, the sanitation teams will be assigned to each UC, where they will operate in shifts to manage the waste load. Supervisors will ensure that every area is covered and that no remains are left behind for long periods. Temporary collection points will be set up across Islamabad to speed up waste removal. These points will act as transfer stations before the waste is finally moved to designated dumping sites. Meanwhile, Magistrates and Assistant Commissioners will be responsible for inspecting their assigned areas during Eid. They will report directly to the control room and coordinate with the sanitation staff. Any negligence in the cleaning operation will be addressed immediately. Special focus will be placed on crowded residential sectors, markets, and areas with a high number of animal sacrifices. Officials have been instructed to prepare for increased workload during the first two days of Eid, when most sacrifices take place. The administration will also provide additional vehicles and machinery where needed. Water sprinkling and lime powder will be used after waste removal to control odor and prevent flies. To encourage participation from the community, mosques and local committees will be informed about the campaign. Loudspeaker announcements and mobile messages will be used to spread information regarding waste collection points and contact numbers. DC Memon said that timely action and cooperation from all departments would ensure a smooth clean-up operation. He stressed that the success of the campaign depends equally on administrative work and responsible behavior from the public.",
