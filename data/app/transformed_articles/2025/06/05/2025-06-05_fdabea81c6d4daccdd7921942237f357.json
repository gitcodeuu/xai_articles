    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Freedom Gate Prosperity (FGP), a non-profit organization, proudly launched its flagship podcast series, \"Freedom Gate Dialogues\", with a powerful and engaging inaugural episode featuring Gulmina Bilal Ahmad, Chairperson of the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC). The session was hosted by Urooj Raza Sayyami, who led a thought-provoking and candid conversation with Chairperson NAVTTC around leadership, public service, and institutional transformation. During the podcast, Gulmina Bilal Ahmad shared her personal and professional journey that led her to assume leadership of NAVTTC. She reflected on the challenges and opportunities that come with steering a national institution responsible for skilling Pakistan's youth and workforce. She laid out her broader vision to reshape NAVTTC as an institution that is accountable to the people and serves as a functional, responsive mechanism to address employment and poverty through skill development. Gulmina congratulated Muhammad Anwar, CEO of FGP and his team on launching this timely initiative. She expressed hope that FGP would go a long way in raising awareness and bringing important development issues to the forefront of public discourse. She also highlighted the critical role NAVTTC was playing in building pathways to economic empowerment for the country's youth and women, particularly in underserved regions. Her emphasis on inclusive policies, practical training and alignment with market needs underscored the organization's shift toward a demand-driven approach to vocational and technical education. FGP podcast aims to provide a platform for visionary leaders, change-makers, and public intellectuals to share their insights and inspire informed civic dialogue.
