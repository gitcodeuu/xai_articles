Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the case filed by former minister. During the hearing, a report was submitted to the court by the Directorate General of Immigration, Passport according to which Fawad Chaudhry's name was removed from the list on June 4. It should be noted that the court had earlier issued an order on September 25, 2024, to remove Fawad Chaudhry's name from the PCL, however, despite the court orders, Fawad Chaudhry had filed a contempt of court petition as this decision was not implemented in time.
