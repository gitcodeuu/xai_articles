    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has urged urgent action to combat plastic pollution threatening Pakistan's coastal ecosystems and marine biodiversity. In his World Environment Day message, he emphasized aligning maritime policies with global climate goals to ensure cleaner oceans and greener coasts. The Ministry has planted millions of mangrove saplings to restore coastal biodiversity and mitigate pollution. Highlighting this year's theme, \"Beat Plastic Pollution,\" Minister Chaudhry called for sustainable solutions to protect Pakistan's over 1,000 km coastline, which supports ports, fishing communities, and coastal towns but is increasingly endangered by plastic waste. He stressed the need to transition from a linear \"take-make-dispose\" economy to a circular model emphasizing reuse, recycling, and sustainable alternatives. The Minister said the Ministry is collaborating with stakeholders to enforce waste regulations at ports and on vessels to prevent marine pollution. Mangrove restoration remains a key focus, as these forests act as natural coastal protectors, nurseries for marine life, and filters for pollutants. \"Pakistan's Indus Delta hosts one of the world's largest mangrove ecosystems, with ongoing efforts involving local communities and international partners\", he added. Minister Chaudhry called on industries, civil society, academia, and citizens to join the fight against plastic pollution, underscoring that lasting solutions require both policy and daily commitment. He concluded: \"Let this World Environment Day be a turning point - a pledge that we, as a nation, will not only protect but also restore the blue heart of our planet. Together, we can chart a course toward cleaner oceans, greener coastlines, and a sustainable future.\"",
