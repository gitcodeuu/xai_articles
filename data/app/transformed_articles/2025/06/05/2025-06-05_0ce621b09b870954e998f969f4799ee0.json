    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Parliamentary Secretary, Farah Naz Akbar visited the construction site of the Daanish School Islamabad on Thursday, a flagship initiative launched under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to provide quality education to underprivileged children. She praised the steady progress and high construction standards maintained throughout the project. She commended the Ministry's Project Management Unit, consultants, and contractors for their professionalism, dedication, and efficiency. Farah Naz Akbar noted that the timely development of the Daanish School Islamabad exemplifies the government's strong commitment to educational reform and inclusive national growth. The project, overseen by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training (MoFEPT) through its Project Management Unit, began on 14 January 2025. Within just four months, the structural work has been completed, and the school has now entered the renovation and finishing phase. Once completed, Daanish School Islamabad is expected to serve as a model of excellence-providing free, high-quality education, modern facilities, and a supportive learning environment to students from marginalized communities. The institution aims to help bridge educational gaps and empower the next generation for future success.",
