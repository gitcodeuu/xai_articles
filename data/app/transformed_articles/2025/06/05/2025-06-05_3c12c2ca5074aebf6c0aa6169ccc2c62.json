    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Qalam Karwan, a literary organization, has held a commemorative session to mark the historic announcement of the creation of Pakistan under the June 3, 1947, plan for the Partition of India. The event featured a keynote address by the esteemed senior jurist, Advocate Kokab Iqbal Noorani, who presented a scholarly paper offering a historical justification for the creation of Pakistan. The special event took place at the premises of Qalam Karwan the other day. In his address, Advocate Noorani argued that the foundation of Pakistan was made possible primarily through the efforts of religious movements, Islamic scholars, freedom fighters, and the deeply rooted Islamic sentiments of the general public. He also criticized secular interpretations of history, which, in his view, have distorted the ideological basis of Pakistan's creation. Following the presentation, attendees engaged in a thoughtful discussion on the contents of the paper. The session concluded with a presidential address by Professor Aftab Hayat, who offered a reflective summary of the key themes discussed during the event.",
