    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Pakistan has joined the global community in commemorating World Environment Day on Thursday reaffirming its dedication to addressing pressing environmental challenges and contributing to international efforts aimed at protecting the planet. In a press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government described the day as a \"significant opportunity to raise awareness about the urgent environmental challenges facing the world\" and to \"accelerate collective efforts\" to address them. Pakistan, among the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, expressed appreciation for ongoing global initiatives to confront the \"triple planetary crises\" of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. The 2025 theme, \"Beat Plastic Pollution,\" was lauded by the Ministry as both \"timely and vital,\" given the increasing threat of plastic waste contaminating land, rivers, and oceans worldwide. The government emphasized that the theme closely aligns with Pakistan's own national priorities. In a landmark move this April, the Government of Pakistan launched the National Action Roadmap to Reduce Plastic Pollution, a strategic framework aimed at minimizing plastic waste through improved waste management practices and promoting circularity in the use of materials. \"Pakistan remains committed to playing its full part in addressing these critical environmental crises and in safeguarding our planet for future generations,\" the statement concluded.",
