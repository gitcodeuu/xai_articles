    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):The National Language Promotion Department (NLPD) has gifted a collection of its published books to the libraries of government educational institutions across the country. A special ceremony to this effect was held under the premises of NLPD the other day. Director General of the NLPD, Professor Dr. Muhammad Saleem Mazhar, presented sets of books to the heads of various colleges. More than 25 principals, both male and female, from public sector colleges participated in the event and received books for their respective libraries. While addressing the gathering, Dr. Mazhar stated that the department possessed a rich collection of high-quality books that it aims to distribute to libraries in public educational institutions nationwide. \"Our objective is to nurture a love for reading among the youth and to acquaint them with the richness of Urdu language and literature,\" he remarked. He further emphasized that while Pakistan's educational system was superior to that of many countries, continuous collective efforts are needed for further improvement. \"Knowledge is a treasure that multiplies when shared, and no education is complete without the inclusion of language and literature,\" he added. Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Rashid Hameed, Executive Director of the NLPD, highlighted the crucial role of language and literature in societal development. \"Today's event marks the first step in our initiative to deliver these books to public college libraries. This effort will not only continue in the future, but students will soon also have digital access to our publications via our website,\" he announced. Deputy Director of the department, Mehboob Khan Bugti, gave a brief introduction to the organization. The ceremony concluded with the presentation of a set of 280 books to each participating college as a gift from the NLPD.",
