He made these remarks during a high-level meeting with Federal Minister for Water Resources, Mian Muhammad Moeen Wattoo, and former Federal Minister for Science and Technology, Changez Khan Jamali. The meeting focused on the pressing water issues in Balochistan and Punjab, as well as strategies for early flood prevention. Minister Aurangzeb Khichi stated that environmental protection is as vital as preserving the country's cultural heritage, and both must be prioritized equally. \"Timely measures to mitigate flood risks and the sustainable use of water resources are the need of the hour,\" he said. Federal Minister for Water Resources, Mian Moeen Wattoo, assured that water distribution among provinces would strictly follow the existing formula, ensuring each province receives its rightful share. He reiterated that no province's water would be diverted to another.

The three leaders agreed that close coordination between federal and provincial governments is essential for tackling water issues and flood risks.
