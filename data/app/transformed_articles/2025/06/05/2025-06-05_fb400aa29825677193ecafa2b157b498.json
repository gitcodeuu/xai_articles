    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Muhammad Shoaib Khan visited the Sangjani Cattle Market late at - night to review security arrangements and ensure smooth traffic flow and public safety ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. An official told APP on Thursday that the visit was part of a broader initiative to secure all officially designated cattle markets in the federal capital and to prevent the setup of illegal markets in unauthorized areas. SSP Shoaib said that Islamabad Police officers were actively performing their duties to protect traders and buyers, while strict legal action was being taken against violators establishing makeshift cattle sale points in residential and public spaces. SSP Shoaib said patrolling units, including the Dolphin Squad and Police Response Unit, had been deployed to thwart the activities of fraudsters, pickpockets, and other criminal elements within and around the cattle markets. SSP Shoaib said the police were committed to ensuring a peaceful and secure environment for citizens, adding that no compromise would be made on the enforcement of law and order.",
