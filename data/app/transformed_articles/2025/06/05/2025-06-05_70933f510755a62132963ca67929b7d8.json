    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Five-time World Champion and twelve-time European Champion Turkish wrestler Riza Kayaalp, on Thursday expressed his desire to train Pakistani youth that would help to develop world-class wrestlers from Pakistan. Speaking at a \"Meet the Press\" event at the National Press Club (NPC) Islamabad, Kayaalp said it would be an honor for him to mentor Pakistani athletes and contribute to the country's sporting future, said a press release. Joined by Dr Abdul Rahman Akkoc, Religious Affairs Counsellor at the Embassy of Turkiye, and Dr Alam Khan, Deputy Counsellor and Embassy Spokesperson, Kayaalp shared his journey from a rural village in Turkiye to global wrestling fame. He said his success came despite limited resources, thanks to the support of his family and dedication to the sport. \"Wrestling is a dangerous sport-one wrong move can be fatal even in jest. It demands seriousness, discipline, and skill,\" he said. Kayaalp added that larger youth population of Pakistan posses great potential, emphasizing that with proper support and joint venture in sports development, they could become not just Asian but global champions in the years to come. Dr Abdul Rahman Akkoc highlighted the global humanitarian efforts of Diyanet, Turkiye's religious and welfare organization, which is operating in 81 countries, including non-Muslim nations. He announced that this Eid-ul-Azha, Diyanet would sacrifice 4,500 animals in 16 cities across Pakistan including Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, and Quetta-with the meat distributed among deserving families. Kayaalp who also collaborates with Diyanet in charitable initiatives, was praised as both a sports hero and a humanitarian. President of the NPC, Azhar Jatoi thanked the Turkish delegation, noting Turkiye's consistent support for Pakistan in every times of need like during floods, earthquakes, or regional tensions. He cited the establishment of Tayyip Erdogan Hospital in DG Khan as a symbol of strong bilateral friendship. Jatoi also proposed the establishment of a wrestling academy in Pakistan under Riza Kayaalp's mentorship to train local youth in professional techniques. Earlier, the acting secretary of the Press Club welcomed the guests, while Dr Alam Khan provided live translation throughout the session. The event concluded with an exchange of goodwill and renewed commitment to sports cooperation between Pakistan and Turkiye.",
