    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture Division, Muhammad Aurangzaib Khichi, on Friday congratulated the nation, and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on the approval of the federal budget 2025-26, terming it a balanced and people-friendly financial plan that offers maximum relief to the low-income and salaried segments of society. In an exclusive conversation with APP, the minister said that despite economic challenges the budget reflects the government's unwavering commitment to economic stability, inclusive growth, and social justice. \"The budget extends the tax net to the elite class to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio, while ensuring lowering the burden on low-income citizens,\" he said, adding that billions of rupees have been allocated for sustainable development, inflation control, and poverty alleviation. Highlighting key features, he said, \"This budget gives special attention to the uplift of agriculture, industry, and the IT sector, along with targeted relief for vulnerable communities, especially the salaried class.\" He emphasized that the government's economic priorities revolve around \"5Es\" Exports, Equity, Empowerment, Environment, and Energy to lay the foundation for a prosperous and self-reliant Pakistan. The minister also extended his heartfelt congratulations to Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Secretary Finance and Chairman FBR for their untiring efforts and presenting a well-balanced, inclusive, and reform-oriented budget. \"There is no doubt that the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 has met the expectations and aspirations of the common people,\" he remarked. In response to a question, he stated that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) maintains a strong alliance with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), and the budget was finalized through consensus and consultation with coalition partners. Responding to another query, he clarified that no new taxes have been imposed on the low-income groups. \"The government's focus remains on providing relief, and we are confident that inflation will continue to decline as a result of these prudent policies.\" The minister urged all citizens to demonstrate unity, patience, and collective resolve in order to steer the country toward sustainable economic development.",
