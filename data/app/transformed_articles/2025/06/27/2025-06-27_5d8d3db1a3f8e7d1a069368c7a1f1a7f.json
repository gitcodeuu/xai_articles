    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf visited Pakistan Navy War College, Lahore, and addressed the participants of the 54th PN Staff Course. While appreciating their efforts, he underscored the importance of understanding the evolving nature of modern warfare and emerging maritime security threats. He emphasised that traditional military strategies must adapt to effectively address the complexities of contemporary security challenges, both traditional and non-traditional, said the Director General of Public Relations (Navy) news release. The Naval Chief, while elaborating on the maritime challenges facing Pakistan and available response options, remarked that the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) remains fluid and contested. He highlighted that new geopolitical realignments and ongoing power rivalries in the region continue to affect the security environment in the IOR. The recent crises between Pakistan and India, as well as the 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, serve as testimony to this dynamic environment. He stated that the conventional, one-dimensional study of warfare is now outdated. Winning future wars demands not only a re-evaluation of legacy warfighting strategies but also the development and maintenance of a future-ready workforce that is intellectually astute and technologically proficient. In conclusion, the Chief of the Naval Staff congratulated graduating officers on the successful completion of the PN Staff Course and encouraged them to be meticulous, analytical, and innovative in their forthcoming appointments.",
