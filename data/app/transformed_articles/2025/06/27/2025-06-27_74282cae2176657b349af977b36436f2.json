    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Friday congratulated the people and government of Iran for their resilience and success in the wake of Israeli aggression. Talking to Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam, he said Pakistan and Iran enjoy cordial ties rooted in shared religion, history, and cultural heritage, reaffirming that the friendship between the two neighbouring countries continues to grow stronger with time. Deputy Speaker National Assembly, Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, and Federal Minister for Interior Syed Mohsin Naqvi were also present on the occasion. The speaker condemned Israel's recent attack on Iran, calling it a flagrant violation of international law. Welcoming the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the speaker emphasized that what the world needs today is not more war, but a renewed commitment to peace. He reiterated that Pakistan has always played a proactive role in promoting peace and stability in the region. Referring to recent regional tensions, he highlighted Pakistan's firm and effective response to Indian aggression, stating that the events clearly exposed the strategic alliance between India and Israel. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has also stated that a successful outcome for Iran and Pakistan in these turbulent times would further solidify their bilateral partnership. He pointed out that India's negative and unconstructive role in the Iran-Israel conflict provides Iran with an opportunity to reconsider its diplomatic and strategic ties with India. The speaker also expressed deep sorrow over the loss of over 50,000 Palestinian lives due to Israeli aggression, calling it a tragedy that has deeply affected every Pakistani. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also said that Parliament and the people of Pakistan stand in complete solidarity with the Iranian nation. Pakistan's National Assembly was the first legislature to pass a resolution condemning the Israeli attack on Iran. Furthermore, more than 200 members of parliament reiterated their support for Iran during their speeches on the National budget for the fiscal year 2025-26. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq stressed the recent conflicts between Pakistan and India, and Iran and Israel, serve as a reminder to the world of the urgent need for peace. He warned that Israel's actions pose a severe threat to regional security and called upon the international community to take immediate and serious notice of the violations of international law. He asserted that Israeli attacks are in clear breach of both international legal norms and the United Nations Charter. Reaffirming Pakistan's commitment to its neighbor, the speaker described Iran as a trusted and brotherly country. He emphasized that Pakistan is determined to expand cooperation with Iran in both parliamentary and economic sectors. He further added that increased parliamentary engagement can play a crucial role in strengthening bilateral relations and bringing the people of both countries closer together. Iranian Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam expressed deep gratitude to the speaker and the people of Pakistan for their consistent and heartfelt support. He acknowledged Pakistan as a true and reliable friend, especially in difficult times. The Ambassador thanked Speaker Ayaz Sadiq for being the first to express solidarity with Iran following the Israeli attack and praised Pakistan's principled stance in supporting Iran across all international platforms. Ambassador Moghadam also conveyed appreciation on behalf of the Iranian Parliament and government to Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, the Parliament of Pakistan, and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for their unwavering support. He stated that Israel's attack was a deliberate attempt to damage Iran's nuclear program, and that Israel's weakening position has led to the United States becoming directly involved in the conflict. The Iranian Ambassador lauded Pakistan's positive and constructive role in supporting peace and stability across the region. He emphasized the importance of strengthening parliamentary cooperation as a means to further deepen ties between the two countries and acknowledged the speaker's commendable efforts in fostering bilateral engagement.",
