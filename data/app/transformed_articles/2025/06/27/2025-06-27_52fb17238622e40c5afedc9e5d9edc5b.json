    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, divided Pakistan's victory in the war against India into three parts, highlighting significant success on the diplomatic and war fronts, including success in the narrative battle. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad on Friday, he said that they were told India was a big country and its resources were seven times more than Pakistan's, and it enjoyed friendly relations with superpowers. However, Pakistan managed to defeat such a powerful nation solely in self-defense and shot down six of its planes. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari further highlighted the situation following the Pahalgam incident, stating that Pakistani ambassadors and representatives of the Foreign Office played a historic role at the diplomatic level. In line with directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the chairman said they worked diligently to convey Pakistan's stance to the international community, which ultimately recognized Pakistan's position. He praised the national media for its performance during the conflict between Pakistan and India. The chairman said that the role of the Pakistani media during the war was excellent, adding that its responsible coverage earned appreciation on the international stage. He contrasted this with the Indian media's narrative, stating that the world witnessed the lies being broadcast from across the border while recognizing the credibility and professionalism of Pakistani journalists. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called on India to implement the ceasefire in principle, criticizing New Delhi's stance as contradictory and based on falsehoods. Bilawal said, \"Just as their war was based on lies, their narrative is also based on lies.\" He stated that India had accepted the ceasefire in the early hours of the conflict, but is now portraying it as merely a temporary measure. \"Listen to their Prime Minister's speech,\" he urged. \"Is he talking about peace, or is he calling for war?\" Bilawal questioned India's sincerity, suggesting its leadership is not genuinely committed to de-escalation.",
