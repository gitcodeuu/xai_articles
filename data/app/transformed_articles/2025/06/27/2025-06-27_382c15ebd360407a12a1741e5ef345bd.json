Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador AKAMATSU congratulated the students and teachers for receiving this valuable gift from the Nippon Foundation and expressed the hope that with these books, students, faculty members, and intellectuals will have more fascinating information on Japan as these books are windows into Japan's rich history, vibrant culture, advanced technology, and unique values. He appreciated the services rendered by NUTECH for offering not only the degree programs but also vocational training and language courses and has cultivated talented students, contributing to Pakistan's human capital. He said that NUTECH's relationship with Japan is noteworthy as it's a registered organization which is sending interns for Japan's Technical Intern Training Program (TITP). \"I believe that NUTECH is playing a pivotal role in people-to-people exchange between Japan and Pakistan,\" said Ambassador AKAMATSU. In his remarks, the Rector NUTECH Lt.
