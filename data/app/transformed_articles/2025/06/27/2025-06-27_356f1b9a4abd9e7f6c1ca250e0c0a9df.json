    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP):The National University of Modern Languages (NUML) in Islamabad has introduced Romanian language courses for the first time in Pakistan, marking a significant milestone in academic engagement between Romania and Pakistan. This development aims to enhance cross-cultural understanding and cooperation. The initiative is the result of an agreement signed between the Romanian Language Institute (RLI) and NUML. Under this partnership, the Romanian Language Institute will appoint a qualified Romanian lecturer to teach courses on Romanian language, literature, culture, and civilization within NUML's Faculty of Languages. These courses will be offered as elective options, enriching the university's academic and cultural diversity. The Romanian lecturer will also participate in cultural promotion activities and contribute to strengthening academic ties between Romania and Pakistan. Romanian Ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Dan Stoenescu, welcomed this initiative, stating that it will enhance educational diplomacy, build people-to-people connections, and promote mutual understanding. He expressed hope for introducing Urdu language classes in Romania in the future. The Romanian language program will cater to students from diverse academic and professional backgrounds, offering courses in multiple formats, including short-term certifications and long-term diplomas. The program aligns with global standards, such as the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). This development reflects the growing interest in building institutional linkages between Romania and Pakistan, following recent joint initiatives in higher education, research, and innovation.",
