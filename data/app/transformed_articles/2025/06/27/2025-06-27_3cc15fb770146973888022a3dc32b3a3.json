    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP)::Islamabad, home to several top-ranking educational institutions, attracts thousands of students from the country's remote areas each year. While they arrive full of dreams for academic success and personal growth, many soon face a harsh and ignored reality, the severe crisis of student accommodation in the city. The core issue lies in the serious shortage of on-campus hostel facilities. Even prestigious universities often fail to provide sufficient internal accommodations, pushing students to seek housing in private hostels or rented apartments. With Islamabad's high living costs, many are left with no option but to settle in private hostels, places that, for many, become centers of exploitation and neglect. Back in 2019, Senator Rehman Malik, then Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior, officially took notice of the growing number of unregulated private hostels in Islamabad. The committee requested detailed reports from the Chief Commissioner, the Capital Development Authority (CDA), and the Higher Education Commission (HEC) on the registration, operations, and safety standards of these hostels. They questioned the lack of legal frameworks, the shortage of university-affiliated hostels, and the absence of standard operating procedures (SOPs), especially concerning the safety of female students. Yet five years later, little has changed. One such student is Hadia Emaan, enrolled at a leading Islamabad university, requested not to name her institution. Her story reflects the struggle of thousands. After securing admission in 2022, she thought the toughest part was behind her, until she discovered her university had no internal hostel. \"I thought once I got in, I could focus on my studies,\" she recalled. \"I didn't realize finding safe, decent housing would be the real nightmare\" she remarked talking to APP. Her first stay was in a cramped seven-seater room in E-11, costing Rs. 18,000 a month. The conditions were appalling. \"The food was inedible, there was no security, and the owner treated us like we had no rights,\" she said. When she complained, he bluntly replied, \"Aap ko nahin pasand tu kahin aur shift kar len\" (If you don't like it, go find another place). After moving between several hostels, Hadia now pays Rs. 30,000 for a single-seater in E-11, yet the problems continue. \"As a female student, it's tough managing alone. Food, water, and living conditions are worse than back home. Despite everything, the charges are unreasonably high.\" Hadia's case isn't rare. Umme Rumman, another university student said, \"Complaints are ignored; there's no security, and it's not worth Rs. 25,000 for a five-seater room.\" \"The quality of life is far worse than at home, yet the charges are outrageous.\" While female students face added safety concerns, male students aren't spared. During protests or security crackdowns, male hostel residents are often evicted on short notice. Travel restrictions prevent them from returning home, disrupting studies and causing emotional distress. Private hostels, often run like unregulated businesses, charge Rs. 20,000 to 40,000 for rooms shared by up to five people, while neglecting basic services like hygiene, food, transport, and security. Some hostel owners, however, claim to maintain acceptable standards. Mr. Liaqat, a hostel owner in Islamabad, said, \"We charge PKR 20,000 per month including meals, transport, internet, cleaning, and laundry. I monitor food quality and hygiene myself. Student issues are resolved quickly, and staff are trained to ensure a safe, respectful environment.\" Even government-run hostels fare no better. Tooba Talal, a student at Allama Iqbal Open University living in an internal hostel, shared, \"There's no proper food. We pay Rs. 23,000 but have to arrange meals ourselves.\" When approached, officials from major universities admitted that a rapidly growing student population and financial constraints had delayed on-campus hostel development. They also clarified that universities cannot affiliate with private hostels due to accountability and safety risks, further complicating matters for students. Addressing Islamabad's hostel crisis demands immediate action. Universities must expand on-campus housing or partner with regulated private hostels to ensure safety, affordability, and dignity. The government should enforce building codes, implement long-delayed SOPs, and empower oversight bodies to hold exploitative owners accountable. Student housing is not just a logistical issue, it's a foundation for academic success and national progress. Ensuring safe, affordable accommodation is a basic right that can no longer be ignored.",
