    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP), in collaboration with Honda Atlas, concluded a three-day road safety campaign aimed at raising awareness among motorcyclists about traffic regulations and ensuring public safety on roads. An official told APP on Friday that the campaign was launched under special directions of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi to promote safe riding practices and enhance traffic discipline in federal capital. SP Traffic Majid Iqbal said the campaign was held in two phases. In the first phase, awareness sessions were conducted on the use of helmets, rear-view mirrors, indicators, headlights, taillights, and speedometers. Citizens were informed about the risks associated with riding motorcycles lacking basic safety features. SP Majid said with the support of Honda Atlas, ITP provided free minor repair services to motorcyclists to ensure roadworthy conditions of their bikes. He said special police squads were deployed to educate riders across the city about road safety and traffic laws. The SP said in the second phase of the campaign, strict legal action would be taken against those riding without helmets, mirrors, indicators, speedometers, or using defective motorcycles. He added that the main objective of the campaign was to protect citizens, reduce accidents, and maintain smooth traffic flow in Islamabad by ensuring enforcement of traffic laws.",
