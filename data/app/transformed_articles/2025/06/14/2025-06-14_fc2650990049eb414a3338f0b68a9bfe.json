    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 14 (APP): Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication, Shaza Fatima Khawaja, warmly welcomed former captain of Pakistan's Women's Cricket Team, Sana Mir, at Islamabad Airport on Saturday. The welcome followed Mir's historic inclusion in the ICC Hall of Fame, a first for any Pakistani woman cricketer. Sana Mir has made a name for herself as the first Pakistani woman to be honoured by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in its Hall of Fame. This achievement is not only a proud moment for Pakistan but also a big step forward for women's cricket around the world. Speaking to the media, Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said that she had known Sana Mir for some time, including when she led the national team and became a role model for many. She praised Mir for her struggle to promote women's cricket and for opening doors for young girls in the sport. \"She made the country proud with her performance and inspired an entire generation,\" the minister said. \"Under her leadership, the women's team reached new heights, including a famous win against India in the World Cup and winning a gold medal for Pakistan.\" Shaza Fatima further said that few women, whether in men's or women's cricket, have earned the kind of respect and recognition Sana Mir has on the global stage. \"She is more than a cricketer - she is a symbol of courage and confidence, especially for young girls,\" she added. The minister also praised Mir for her efforts to support women's cricket and encourage young girls through sports. \"Sana Mir's journey shows the strength and determination of Pakistani women. She is not just a sports hero but a national pride,\" she said. Sana Mir said it felt like another Women's Day celebration. \"I am very grateful to everyone who came to welcome me. My family and fans are here, they have always supported me,\" she said. She highlighted the importance of real opportunities for women to succeed. \"When women get the kind of support I received from my parents, brothers, friends, and society - we see the results,\" she said. Mir also acknowledged her supporters, mentioning people like Raza who stood by her throughout her journey. \"This journey was never just mine,\" she said. Sana Mir said, \"Let's keep supporting women to grow and succeed. InshaAllah, many more women like me will rise and make Pakistan proud. I hope we can all be part of their support system.\"",
