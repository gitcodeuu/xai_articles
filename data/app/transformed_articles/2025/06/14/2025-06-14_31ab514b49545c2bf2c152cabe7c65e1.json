Citing Khawaja Asif's statement, she revealed that Rs 5.8 trillion was lost last year due to tax loopholes, subsidies, and concessions. She called for comprehensive tax reforms to ease the burden on the salaried and middle-income classes. MQM-P MNA Sofia Saeed Shah noted that although Rs 3.2 billion has been allocated for the KV-4 water project in Karachi, the amount falls short of the rising costs. She recalled MQM's earlier proposal of Rs 30 billion for the project and questioned the government's claims of reducing electricity prices while increasing levies on fuel. SIC lawmaker Shahzada Muhammad Gushtasap Khan stressed the need to increase allocations for education and health.

While welcoming the government's target of 4.2% economic growth and the allocation of special allowances for the armed forces, he expressed disappointment over the lack of substantial allocations for Balochistan.

Participating in the budget debate, SIC MNA Amjad Ali Khan claimed that economy did not perform well during the fiscal year 2024-25, citing example of low growth of agriculture and Large Scale Manufacturing.

Meanwhile, on a point of order, SIC MNA Asad Qaiser announced his party's token walkout from the National Assembly proceedings, expressing displeasure over the absence of relevant officials during the budget debate. He stated that \"nobody\" was present to take note of SIC members' suggestions, prompting the walkout decision. Responding to the SIC token walkout, PML-N MNA Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry clarified that ministers, parliamentary secretaries, and senior officials from the Ministry of Finance were taking due note of the points raised in the House. He said, ample time was being provided to parliamentarians to express their views on the budget proposals. He urged opposition members to take the session seriously and present constructive suggestions to improve the budget. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Naz Baloch, while participating in the budget debate, called on the government to prioritize the development of Karachi, describing it as the economic engine of the country.

Commending the finance team, she described the budget as people-friendly and a reflection of responsible policymaking in difficult circumstances. Ms Aurangzeb said the country was steered away from the brink of economic collapse due to the prudent policies of the incumbent government, which successfully reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). She added that key economic indicators-including the policy rate, inflation, and public debt-were now showing positive trends. Dawar Khan Kundi, SIC MNA, criticised the federal budget during the ongoing debate, terming it \"direction-less\" and lacking a clear economic vision. He claimed the budget was designed primarily to fulfill International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions without incorporating any meaningful political input. Kundi pointed out that no comprehensive plans were introduced for poverty alleviation, agricultural development, or other critical sectors. He also called on the government to enhance Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) allocations for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which, he noted, have borne the brunt of terrorism and where residents continue to suffer from underdevelopment, particularly in newly merged tribal districts.

Speaking on the floor, he called for a tax exemption on solar panel imports to help reduce the country's reliance on oil imports, thereby conserving valuable foreign exchange reserves. He also raised concerns about the substandard production of various oil products by local refineries, stating that poor-quality oil is posing serious health risks and damaging vehicle engines. Furthermore, Mehmud proposed exempting electric vehicles from import duties to promote a cleaner environment and reduce the import of edible oils, diesel, and petrol. Shakir Bashir Awan lauded the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the armed forces for successfully confronting Indian aggression, and said the entire Pakistani nation stood with the government and armed forces during difficult times which is commendable. He also strongly condemned Israel's attack on Iran saying that the masses of Pakistanare standing with the Iran.

He also appreciated the Green Pakistan initiative, expressing hope it would improve the agriculture sector. Awan emphasized the challenges faced by farmers, especially due to rising costs and climate change, and demanded the construction of small dams in his native district of Khushab, which faces water scarcity. He also urged the government to allocate budgetary funds for Khushab and fulfill the promise of establishing a university there. He highlighted the need to build the proposed motorway from Lilla to Musakhel, which he said would connect the region to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), promote tourism, and bring development to connected areas. Meanwhile, Muhammad Moazzam Ali Khan Jatoi noted that no livestock census has been conducted since 2006 and forest statistics are also outdated. He proposed planting palm oil trees along the coastal belt and emphasized the importance of setting a national minimum wage. Jatoi called on the government to reduce the role of middlemen and provide direct support to landlords and farmers. He also demanded the establishment of a university in his constituency and proposed that instead of simply handing out money under the Benazir Income Support Program, the government should focus on creating job opportunities for the underprivileged. Asad Sikandar of the PPP, while participating in the budget debate, said that all provinces should be treated equally and given equal rights. He demanded relief in GST on solar panels to facilitate the poor, suggesting it should be further reduced from the current 10 percent. Ammar Ahmad Khan Leghari of PML(N) expressed concern over satellite internet services being provided through only one company. He argued that this was not a viable approach, as local companies also have the capability to operate in this domain and should be given the opportunity. He emphasized the need to make the satellite internet industry more competitive. Leghari highlighted the untapped potential in the country's IT export sector, noting that exports could be significantly increased. To achieve this, he stressed the importance of investing in vocational training and organizing workshops at the school, college, and university levels to develop a skilled workforce. He described the formation of a crypto council as a golden opportunity to regulate and promote cryptocurrency through official exchange platforms, allowing for proper oversight and monitoring. Additionally, Leghari underlined the importance of climate financing, suggesting that efforts in this area be strengthened to support sustainable development initiatives.

He pointed out the budget for lacking a clear policy direction on industrial growth and foreign investment, warning that such omissions could hinder long-term economic development. He noted that while the government appeared to be prioritizing privatization, it must first work to build investor confidence, which is essential for the success of any privatization efforts. Sabir also highlighted the severe challenges facing Karachi, the country's economic hub, particularly prolonged electricity load-shedding and other urban issues. He proposed that, just as the government has introduced a distinction between filers and non-filers, cities should also be categorized based on their tax contributions. He argued that this approach would help ensure Karachi receives the development attention and investment it deserves to restore its infrastructure and appeal. Shaista Pervaiz of the PML(N) lauded the financial team for presenting the best possible budget under the existing fiscal constraints, expressing hope that the next year would be better than the current one. She said that Rs. 2.55 trillion were allocated for defense in light of the prevailing situation.

Munawar Ali Talpur of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), while speaking during the debate, stated that the budget reflected the collective stance of the coalition government.
