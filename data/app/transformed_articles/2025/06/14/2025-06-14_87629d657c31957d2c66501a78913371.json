Addressing the press conference to international media in Brussels, the Chairman of Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) called the internationally community to play its vital role and to engage with India and emphasize that military confrontation was not a solution to the Kashmir dispute or terrorism, stressing that dialogue was the only way forward. It was a moral obligation, he said that all international community should play its part to encourage both sides to engage in dialogue through diplomacy for peace in the region, adding that Pakistan wanted bilateral composite dialogue to tackle the issues on table. \"Escalation is not a solution of the issues confronting between two nuclear states,\" Bilawal stressed.
