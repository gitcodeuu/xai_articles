    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 14 (APP):Federal Minister for Science and Technology, Khalid Hussain Magsi has strongly condemned the recent Israeli aggression, terming it a direct attack on global peace and a blatant violation of international laws. In a statement, Magsi emphasized that supporting the oppressed is a diplomatic, moral, and humanitarian responsibility. He expressed full solidarity with the brotherly nation of Iran, reiterating Pakistan's commitment to stand by its allies in times of crisis. \"This aggression by Israel is not just a regional matter-it's a serious threat to international peace and a direct defiance of international norms,\" Magsi said. He stressed that protecting humanity cannot be achieved through words alone, but through decisive and effective actions. He also condemned the violation of state sovereignty, calling it a grave breach of global protocols and laws. Magsi urged the international community to play its role in halting Israel's aggression and to uphold the principles of justice and peace.",
