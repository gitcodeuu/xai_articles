    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 03 (APP): Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry emphasized the crucial role of oil spill drills in ensuring effective preparedness to safeguard marine life and habitats from the severe and enduring effects of oil pollution on the ocean environment. Speaking to the media during his visit to the Karachi Port, where he observed a Oil Spill Response Exercise (OSRC), the Federal Minister stated that, as part of ministry's dedication, these drills have improved national oil spill response capabilities by more than 70% in recent years and have been institutionalized across major ports to guarantee thorough preparedness for environmental emergencies. The minister emphasized that such exercises are vital in enabling response teams to practice containment, cleanup, and mitigation strategies. \"These drills are essential in minimizing environmental damage when actual oil spills occur,\" he said. Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry elaborated on the ecological threats posed by oil pollution, stating, \"Oil pollution harms vulnerable marine species by coating and poisoning them, destroying critical habitats, disrupting food webs, and causing toxic bioaccumulation. All of this leads to population declines and long-lasting damage to ocean ecosystems.\" He further pointed out that natural carbon sinks such as mangroves and seagrass beds are particularly affected, rendering them unable to play their role in mitigating climate change. \"The slow recovery of these ecosystems results in prolonged environmental stress, biodiversity loss, and significant economic and social consequences for human communities relying on marine resources,\" the minister added. The minister stated that nearly 80 percent of Pakistan's coastal population depends on fisheries for their livelihood. He added that about 1 million people in the coastal areas are directly engaged in fishing, while a similar number work within the fishery value chain, making fisheries a crucial source of income and sustenance for approximately 2 million people in total. Earlier, Minister Chaudhry was briefed by General Manager Operations, Rear Admiral Atiq-ur-Rehman, and Manager Marine Pollution Control, Fayyaz Rasool about the drill. The Marine Pollution Control Department team also showcased oil spill response equipment and provided detailed explanations of its functions and usage.",
