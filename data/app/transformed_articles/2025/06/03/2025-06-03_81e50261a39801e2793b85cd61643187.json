    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 3 (APP):Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi and Uzbekistan's Ambassador to Pakistan, Ali Shir Takhtae held detailed discussions on Tuesday regarding the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Transit Corridor project. The meeting was focused to further strengthen cooperation in the railway sector and to devise a joint strategy for the completion of this historic project, said a news release. During the meeting, the leaders described the project as a milestone for regional economic growth and the consolidation of trade ties. Consensus was reached to finalize cooperation on this approximately 850-kilometer long railway connectivity project, which included the construction of a new 647-kilometer railway line through Afghanistan. This corridor will become the first direct railway link between Central Asia and South Asia, opening new avenues for trade and economic collaboration in the region.

The Minister termed this project a historic milestone that will provide Central Asia direct access to Pakistan's ports, facilitating easier access to global trading markets. Hanif Abbasi emphasized the strategic importance of the project as a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative, stating, \"This project will not only reinforce economic ties but will also play a pivotal role in promoting regional peace and stability.\" Ambassador Ali Shir Takhtaev highlighted the vast investment opportunities in Pakistan's railway sector and the potential to enhance bilateral trade relations.
