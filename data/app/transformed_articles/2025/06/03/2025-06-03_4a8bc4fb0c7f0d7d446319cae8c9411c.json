    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 03 (APP):The Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development has taken up the issue on Pakistani nationals being deported from Gulf and other countries due to beggary and fake documents. The committee, chaired by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, met at Parliament House on Tuesday to discuss the matter. According to officials from the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, around 7,873 Pakistanis have been deported from 2019 to 2025 on various charges, including beggary. Of these, 1,064 were deported for beggary, and 1,460 deportees had gone abroad through 691 Overseas Employment Promoters (OEPs). The committee expressed concern over the growing trend of beggary and other crimes committed by Pakistani nationals abroad, which has brought disgrace to the nation's image. Senator Zamir Hussain Ghumro asked about the steps taken by the ministry to prevent such incidents, while Senator Shahadat Awan questioned the legality of cancelling passports of individuals who commit crimes abroad. The ministry informed the committee that it has initiated cancellation of passports of all deportees to discourage the growing trend of beggary. The committee recommended that the ministry initiate criminal proceedings against OEPs involved in sending deportees abroad and provide details of OEPs who sent the maximum number of Pakistanis abroad who have been found involved in beggary and other criminal activities. The committee also sought segregated data of 5,000 deportees who went abroad on permit and visit visa to determine the role of OEPs in the matter. Officials from the Interior Ministry stated that around 58,000 Pakistanis have been deported since 2023, with 5,600 deported on account of beggary from Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar. The committee was also briefed about the economic diplomacy to increase migration of skilled labor abroad. The Managing Director of the Overseas Employment Corporation (OEC) informed the committee that around 10.3 million Pakistani skilled workers are employed in various countries, and OEC has MoUs with 18 countries. The committee appreciated the work done by OEC and decided to pay a visit to laboratories established by OEC in the upcoming meeting. The committee also sought a report from the DG Passport and Immigration regarding 24,000 speaking orders issued to facilitate deportees during the last three months.",
