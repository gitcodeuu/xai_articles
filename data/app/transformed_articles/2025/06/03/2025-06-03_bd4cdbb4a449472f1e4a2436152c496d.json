    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 03 (APP):Devcom-Pakistan kicked off World Environment Day celebrations by hosting the Pakistan Environmental Awards and Conference of Best Practices 2025, centered on the theme \"Beyond Plastic Waste - Navigating Climate and Environmental Risks.\" The event gathered policymakers, environmental experts, and sustainability advocates to address Pakistan's pressing ecological challenges here on Tuesday. Prominent figures, including Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, Dr. Sebastian Paust from the German Embassy, Vice Admiral (Retd.) Ahmed Saeed of the National Institute of Maritime Affairs, and Dr. Zaigham Abbas of Pak-EPA, emphasized the urgent need to combat plastic pollution and climate threats. The Federal Minister for Board of Investment called for strict measures against single-use plastics, declaring, \"A cleaner Pakistan begins with the choices we make today.\" Munir Ahmed, founder of Devcom-Pakistan, warned that plastic pollution is a \"ticking time bomb\" and stressed the importance of waste segregation and circular economy practices. Dr. Zaigham Abbas urged businesses to adopt sustainable packaging and waste management, while Vice Admiral (Retd.) Ahmed Saeed highlighted the dangers of marine pollution in Pakistan's waters. The ceremony honored sustainability leaders, including SinoHydro Dasu-Mansehra Power Transmission Line for eco-friendly energy infrastructure, Capital Smart City for urban sustainability, and OGDCL for environmental compliance. Individuals like Rina Saeed Khan (wildlife conservation) and Teacher Usman (community rainwater harvesting) were also recognized. Environmental journalists, including Jamal Shahid (Dawn) and Afshan S. Khan (The News), received awards for their impactful reporting. The event reinforced the need for stronger policies, corporate accountability, and public engagement to tackle plastic pollution and climate risks. World Environment Day, observed globally on June 5, is this year hosted by South Korea with a focus on ending plastic pollution. Pakistan's initiatives aim to drive meaningful action toward a sustainable future.",
