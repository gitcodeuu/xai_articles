He urged parents to proactively seek out polio workers and ensure the immunization of their children, reminding that safeguarding children's health is a matter of accountability both in this life and the hereafter. The minister highlighted that while cancer treatment is possible, polio remains an incurable disease, reinforcing the critical need to eliminate the virus through effective vaccination campaigns. He called for a significant policy shift to enhance campaign effectiveness and stressed the importance of unity and societal participation in this national mission. \"Only two countries in the world still face the threat of polio,\" Mustafa Kamal stated, noting ongoing extensive campaigns in Afghanistan, effectively supported by the Afghan government.
