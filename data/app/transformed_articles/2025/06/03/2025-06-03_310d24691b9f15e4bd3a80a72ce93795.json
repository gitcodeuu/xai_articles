    "article_body": "PESHAWAR, Jun 03 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday affirmed the immense sacrifices rendered by the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) in the fight against terrorism, and said the federal government would stand by the province until the complete eradication of the menace. Addressing a representative jirga, the prime minister said that KP has received Rs700 billion since 2010 under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award as its one percent share allocated for anti-terrorism efforts. These funds were released to strengthen the provincial police force, develop the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and enhance the capacity of law enforcement agencies, he added. \"The decision to allocate one percent of the NFC Award for KP, agreed by all provinces, was just and appropriate decision, as KP has remained the frontline province in the war against terrorism,\" he said. Highlighting the province's unwavering commitment and support to Pakistan, the prime minister said that KP's people had voted in favour of the country during the referendum and had stood by the armed forces through all challenges. \"The sacrifices of KP's people who laid down their lives and sustained injuries for the defence of Pakistan are deeply revered and will be remembered in golden words,\" he added. Referring to the tragic Army Public School (APS) attack on December 16, 2014, the prime minister paid tribute to the students and teachers who lost their lives in the brutal incident. Speaking on recent security developments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan had given a strong response to last month's unprovoked Indian aggression under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir. He reiterated that Pakistan's decisive retaliation had frustrated India's nefarious plans, adding that \"India will never forget this decisive response of Pakistan.\" The prime minister further shared that during recent visits to Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, leaders of these countries expressed joy over Pakistan's \"historic victory\" against India. He said that the Indian Prime Minister Modi was left \"frustrated and in a state of panic\" after the defeat. Reaffirming Pakistan's rights under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the prime minister asserted that India cannot deprive Pakistan of its rightful share of water and suspend the treaty unilaterally. He emphasized the need to expand existing water storage capacity and accelerate work on major dam projects, including Diamer Bhasha and Dasu dams. Calling for national unity in the face of external threats, PM Shehbaz Sharif appreciated the people of KP for offering special prayers for the country's success against India. The jirga was attended by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, federal and provincial ministers, senators, parliamentarians, the Corps Commander Peshawar, Chief Secretary KP, and the Inspector General of Police. The participants offered Fateha for the martyrs of Pakistan, paying tribute to both civilian and military personnel who have laid down their lives for the nation.",
