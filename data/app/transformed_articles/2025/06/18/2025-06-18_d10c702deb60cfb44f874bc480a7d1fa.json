    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP):Pakistan Muslim League (N) Member of National Assembly Malik Abrar has said that the Punjab government presented the best budget in history. He has appealed to Federal Finance Minister Aurangzeb Khan to immediately withdraw the 18 percent tax imposed on solar. Talking to journalists outside the Parliament House on Wednesday, Malik Abrar said, \"Despite being a part of the government benches, I am appealing to the Finance Minister in the public interest. I had also taken the same stand during my speech in the National Assembly that tax on solar should be withdrawn so that relief can be given to the poor people. He further said that solar energy is an important means of environmental protection and dealing with the energy crisis; therefore, tax should not be imposed on it, and the poor people who are benefiting should get it in any case. He said that he paid tribute to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for presenting the best budget of Punjab province.",
