    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP): Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has stated that Pakistan and Hungary have vast potential for expanding bilateral relations particularly in the areas of parliamentary diplomacy, education, trade and cultural exchange. He expressed these views during a meeting with Bela Fazekas, Ambassador of Hungary to Pakistan, who paid a farewell call on the Speaker at Parliament House on Wednesday. During the meeting, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq appreciated Ambassador Fazekas's positive contributions in strengthening bilateral ties during his tenure. He also expressed appreciation of the ambassador's efforts in facilitating the visit of a Pakistani parliamentary delegation to Hungary, which was led by the speaker himself and regarded as a significant milestone in bilateral parliamentary cooperation. The speaker also expressed hope that Ambassador Fazekas would continue to serve as a bridge between the two nations and praised the ambassador's affection for Pakistan. He also highlighted the importance of reactivating the Pakistan-Hungary Parliamentary Friendship Group, terming it essential for further enhancing mutual ties through people-to-people and legislative engagement. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq emphasized that Pakistan has always pursued a policy of restraint, particularly during periods of heightened tensions with India. He stressed the urgent need for lasting peace in the region, noting that it is the common people who suffer the most in times of war and conflict. He also reiterated Pakistan's parliamentary position on condemning attacks on Iran, expressing concern that such actions could further destabilize the already volatile regional security environment. Ambassador Bela Fazekas has also expressed gratitude for the cooperation extended to him by the Parliament of Pakistan and shared that he carries fond memories of his time in the country. He counted the successful organization of the Pakistani parliamentary delegation's visit to Hungary as one of the proudest achievements of his diplomatic service in Pakistan. The ambassador reaffirmed Hungary's interest in continuing to build upon the foundations laid during his tenure and expressed confidence that bilateral relations between Pakistan and Hungary would continue to grow in the years to come.",
