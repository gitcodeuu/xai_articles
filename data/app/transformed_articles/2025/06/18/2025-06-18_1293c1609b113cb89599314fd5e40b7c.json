    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP):Chairman Senate Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani on Wednesday extended a warm welcome to the student and faculty delegations from Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) and the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) during Wednesday's proceedings of the Upper House. Earlier, senior Senate officials warmly welcomed a 47-member delegation from Quaid-i-Azam University's Department of English and a 50-member delegation of students and faculty from IIUI's Faculty of Shariah and Law. Two delegations from leading academic institutions visited the Parliament House for an educational study tour designed to enhance their understanding of Pakistan's legislative process and parliamentary traditions. The visiting delegations toured the Senate Museum, where they viewed a comprehensive documentary highlighting the Senate's historical evolution, major national events, constitutional milestones, and parliamentary traditions. The documentary provided valuable visual and archival insight into Pakistan's constitutional journey, showcasing important legislative documents and pivotal moments in national history. The students later visited the Senate Hall, where they observed the proceedings of the Upper House in session. They were also briefed on the legislative process, parliamentary procedures, and the operational aspects of the Senate. The students termed the visit highly informative and professionally enriching, stating that the experience significantly enhanced their academic understanding and professional perspective. The delegations appreciated the Senate's initiative and expressed hope that such educational visits would continue in the future to strengthen the younger generation's awareness of democratic institutions and the law-making process in Pakistan.",
