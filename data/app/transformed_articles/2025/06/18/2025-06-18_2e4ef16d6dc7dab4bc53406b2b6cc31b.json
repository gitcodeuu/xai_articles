    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP): Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday underscored the Global Development Initiative (GDI) as a symbol of connectivity, coastal development, and regional integration, reaffirming Pakistan's strong support for the vision initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Speaking at the curtain-raiser ceremony of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) Group, the minister termed it an honour to address a platform that embodies a new era of international cooperation and inclusive progress. He highlighted Pakistan's strategic advantage, stating, \"With over 1,000 kilometers of coastline and key ports like Karachi, Port Qasim, and Gwadar, Pakistan stands as a natural hub for trade and energy corridors.\" The minister noted that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has already laid a solid foundation, transforming Gwadar into a vital economic link connecting China with the Arabian Sea. \"GDI builds upon this progress, complementing our national goals of infrastructure modernization, environmental resilience, and equitable development, particularly for underserved coastal communities such as Ormara and Pasni,\" he emphasized. Junaid Anwar Chaudhry outlined Pakistan's maritime ambitions under the GDI framework, which include digitizing and greening port operations, developing sustainable ocean industries, and enhancing logistics connectivity from coast to hinterland. He stressed the importance of ensuring that the dividends of development reach marginalized populations, adding that maritime advancement is critical to social harmony by offering alternatives to poverty and extremism. He also lauded the efforts of the Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change, Romina Khurshid Alam, for her commitment to integrating GDI into Pakistan's parliamentary and youth development frameworks. \"As the global community searches for models that promote equitable and sustainable growth, GDI offers a timely and people-centric solution,\" said the minister. \"Let us work collectively to realize this shared vision for a more connected and prosperous future.\" The ceremony brought together key stakeholders from government, civil society, and development sectors to explore the transformational potential of GDI for Pakistan and the wider region.",
