    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP):The Anti-Terrorism Court of Islamabad on Wednesday adjourned the hearing of a case related to the alleged attempt to run over Rangers personnel during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protest held on November 26. The case was scheduled for hearing in the court of Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, but due to the absence of the accused and their legal representatives, the proceedings could not take place. The court has now rescheduled the hearing for June 23. During the hearing, the court was informed that neither the accused nor their lawyers appeared, leading to the adjournment without any arguments or progress. On the next date, the prosecution witnesses are expected to record their statements. According to court documents, the prosecution has already submitted a charge sheet in connection with one of the accused, Hashim Abbasi. The case was registered at Islamabad's Ramna Police Station against several individuals including PTI founder, Bushra Bibi, former federal minister Ali Amin Gandapur, and Hashim Abbasi. They are accused of involvement in a protest where an attempt was allegedly made to run over Rangers officials.",
