    "article_body": "Member of the National Assembly, Nasir Iqbal, congratulated the people of Pakistan and paid tribute to the armed forces for defeating a much larger enemy through the government's timely strategy. Speaking during the budget debate, he praised the government for steering the country away from the threat of default and turning economic indicators positive. He said the incumbent government's tireless efforts had helped the country recover from severe challenges. Discussing agriculture, he emphasized the importance of the sector and urged the government to either raise crop prices or reduce production costs. He called for lowering water prices, removing taxes on solar energy, and reducing fertilizer prices to ease the burden on farmers. He also stressed the need for reviving agricultural research centers and modernizing farming techniques to increase per-acre yield, enhance farmer income, and curb inflation. Nasir Iqbal also highlighted the lack of access to international markets for farmers and urged the government to facilitate this to help them secure better prices for their produce. Meanwhile, Nauman Islam Sheikh also lauded the armed forces for decisively defeating India and criticized the imposition of taxes on solar energy, especially when electricity is already too expensive for farmers. He called for unity in Parliament and urged the political class to act as a nation and work collectively for the country's progress instead of engaging in endless criticism. He also praised Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's recent foreign visit, calling it a strong diplomatic move that positively represented Pakistan and exposed Indian aggression. However, he lamented that no development schemes were included in the budget for Sukkur, where gas load shedding remains a problem. Mohmand Ali Sarfraz pointed out that farmers are in distress and unable to sell their wheat. He said that rising petrol prices are main reason for inflation and expressed concern over job losses due to institutional downsizing. He rejected the government's plan to impose partial taxes on solar energy and argued for a complete exemption. He also rejected proposed banking regulations in the budget that would probe transactions, calling it a violation of customers' basic rights. Shahid Usman commended the bravery of the Pakistani nation during tense moments with India. He said the world had witnessed Pakistan's resolve and its readiness to retaliate against any aggression. He termed Pakistan as a responsible nuclear state seeking peace but prepared to respond forcefully if provoked. He also lauded the leadership of Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif under which Finance Division presented a commendable budget during difficult times. He noted that inflation had decreased over the past two years, the current account was in surplus, the rupee had stabilized, and remittances were expected to reach $38 billion by the end of the month. He said that tough decisions were necessary for national progress and commended both federal and provincial leadership. Referring to his own constituency in Gujranwala, he highlighted the absence of a hospital for a population of 1.1 million. He recalled that Nawaz Sharif had approved one in 2014, but the PTI government scrapped the project. He urged for its restoration and the construction of a much-needed flyover. He also thanked Maryam Nawaz for providing clean water plants. Syed Ali Musa Gilani(PPP) criticized the lack of clear solutions presented during budget speeches and called for reviving the nation's economic self-respect. He underlined the need for strengthening local industry, noting the irony of exporting locally made goods and importing expensive foreign ones. He said if Pakistan could build the JF-17 Thunder jet, it should also be able to manufacture vehicles and other necessary tools. Gilani stressed the need for national pride in locally produced goods. He also criticized former Prime Minister Imran Khan for not condemning Israeli actions. He urged the Iran to strongly respond to Israeli aggression. He also called on the Prime Minister and Finance Minister to announce a self-reliance policy that focuses on using and producing domestic goods. Mehtab Akbar Rashdi (PPP) expressed reservations regarding the ongoing right-sizing initiative, particularly proposals involving the merger or dissolution of institutions like the Academy of Letters, Urdu Science Board, and federal scientific bodies. She emphasized the necessity of a thorough review of these proposals. She voiced concerns over the reduction of government posts, warning that it could limit employment opportunities. Emphasizing the need for pension policy reforms, she specifically advocated for extending the claim period for widows. Additionally, she pointed out ambiguities in the budget's climate change policy, urging for greater clarity and increased funding for the Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway project.",
