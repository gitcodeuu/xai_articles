    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 11 (APP):Chairperson of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid, undertook a comprehensive field visit to BISP payment centers in Tehsil Gambat and the Village Council Office Togh Bala, Kohat, to assess service delivery and engage directly with women beneficiaries. During the visit, Senator Rubina Khalid met with recipients of the financial assistance program, listening attentively to their concerns and reaffirming BISP's unwavering commitment to the socio-economic empowerment of women across Pakistan, said a news release received here. Highlighting the legacy of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, the Chairperson urged the women to draw inspiration from her bravery and stand firmly for their rights. \"These payments are your rightful entitlement,\" she emphasized. \"If anyone demands unauthorized deductions, report it immediately. BISP will take strict legal action against any form of malpractice.\" She also underscored the importance of efficiency in service delivery, directing that only those beneficiaries who receive a payment notification via 8171 should approach the campsites. \"Given limited resources, repeated surveys are not feasible,\" she stated, instructing staff to place clear and informative banners at each site to ensure transparency. At the Village Council Office Togh Bala, Senator Rubina Khalid directed BISP staff to provide attentive and respectful support to all beneficiaries, ensuring a seamless and dignified experience for the deserving women. Later, Senator Rubina Khalid met with Deputy Commissioner Kohat, Mr. Abdul Akram, to review arrangements at BISP campsites. The meeting focused on improving facilities such as shaded waiting areas, clean drinking water, and enhanced cooperation from partner banks to ensure optimal service delivery. The Deputy Commissioner assured full support and presented a commemorative shield to the Chairperson in recognition of her efforts.",
