    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 11 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday adjourned the applications for suspension of the sentence of the founder of PTI and his wife Bushra Bibi, convicted in the 190 million pound case and their release on bail. The cause list of the case was canceled due to Justice Muhammad Asif, a member of the division bench that heard the case in the Islamabad High Court, being on leave. The next hearing will be held on June 26. A two-member division bench of the IHC, consisting of Acting Chief Justice Sardar Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, was to hear the applications for suspension of sentence of the founder of PTI and Bushra Bibi in the 190 million pound case, but due to the fact that the member of the bench, Justice Muhammad Asif, was on leave, the petitions could not be heard. PTI founder Aleema Khan, along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and the PTI leadership met the Acting Chief Justice's secretary regarding scheduling the next date.",
