In a post on his official account on social media platform X on Wednesday, Wali Khan remarked, \"In the past, some claimed that Pakistan's economy was on the verge of collapse, while others criticised it overall economic indicators and outlook. However, against all odds and despite such scepticism, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has not only revitalized the economy but is steering it towards greater stability.\" He also emphasized the government's commitment to supporting taxpayers, stating that those who contribute through taxes will be facilitated.",
