    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 11 (APP): A meeting of the FBR Review Committee was held here Wednesday under the chairmanship of Federal Minister for Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazir Tarar, in which the ongoing legal proceedings and progress of cases of the FBR were reviewed. A progress report of the decisions taken on priority basis as per the instructions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan was presented in the meeting. The law minister issued important instructions to the FBR and the relevant legal team regarding the future course of action so that revenue-related cases can be effectively brought to a logical conclusion. The meeting was informed that the Attorney General's Office is providing continuous legal support to the Legal Wing of the FBR, which is yielding positive results. During the last three months, the FBR has made possible the recovery of about Rs. 112 billion in various cases, which is a major progress. On this occasion, detailed consideration was also given to possible legal proposals to be included in the upcoming federal budget. The law minister expressed the hope that these measures would not only improve the legal system but also help in fiscal stability",
