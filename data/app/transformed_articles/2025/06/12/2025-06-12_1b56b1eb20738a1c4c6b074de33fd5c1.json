    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP):A special ceremony was organized in Capital Developmnet Authority (CDA) on Thursday to honor the efforts of sanitation workers, following the successful execution of Civic body's \"Zero Waste Operation.\" In a commendable display of teamwork and public service, the capital city maintained exemplary cleanliness during Eid ul-Azha, earning praise from citizens and government officials alike, said the interior minister Mohsin Naqvi addressing the employees of CDA. The initiative, led by Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, saw the participation of over 2,500 sanitation workers and 250 vehicles who worked tirelessly across both urban and rural parts of Islamabad. Their efforts resulted in the collection of 2,400 tons of offal and waste over just three days. Addressing the ceremony, Minister Naqvi paid tribute to the dedication of the sanitation staff. \"The workers performed their duties day and night with great commitment,\" he stated. He expressed his gratitude to all stakeholders involved, including CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, Deputy Commissioner Irfan Memon, Assistant Commissioners, and field teams for their leadership and coordination. To appreciate their hard work, Naqvi announced a bonus equal to one month's basic salary for all employees who took part in the operation. Additionally, daily wage workers will receive a cash reward of Rs. 15,000 each. Naqvi emphasized that the public's positive response was a true acknowledgment of the CDA's performance. \"Citizens expressed great satisfaction with the cleanliness across Islamabad during Eid,\" he noted. He also praised the cooperation of the public, which he said played a crucial role in the operation's success. Advanced technology was employed to ensure effective monitoring, with drone cameras helping to oversee the entire cleanliness drive. The Safe City team was particularly commended for its role in maintaining surveillance and coordination. \"All departments including CDA, MCI, District Administration, Islamabad Police, Safe City, and Traffic Police worked in harmony, setting aside institutional differences for the greater good,\" said Naqvi. \"From officers to field workers, everyone delivered as one team.\" He urged citizens to continue treating Islamabad as their own and to work together to maintain it as a clean and green city that meets international standards. CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa also addressed the ceremony, thanking all the teams involved for their round-the-clock efforts. The event was attended by several key officials, including Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha, IG Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi, DG Safe City, and other senior members of the administration. The ceremony concluded with renewed commitment from all departments to continue serving the public with dedication and integrity.",
