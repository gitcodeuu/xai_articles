    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP): Federal Minister for Law, Justice and Human Rights, Senator, Azam Nazeer Tarar on Thursday said that protecting children from forced labour required collective responsibility and he called for greater awareness of children's rights and urged every segment of society to play its part in ending child labour. He made these remarks while speaking at an event organized by the Child Protection Institute in Islamabad to mark the World Day Against Child Labour. Senator Tarar said that the government alone cannot eliminate child labour and that the community must also participate in this effort. He pointed out that everyone, from individuals to institutions, must contribute to protecting children from being forced into work. Tarar highlighted the key role being played by the Child Protection Institute, which worked to safeguard children's wellbeing. \"Institutes like these are essential in addressing child protection issues,\" he said. While discussing broader national challenges, the federal minister also linked child protection with larger development concerns. \"Pakistan's rapidly growing population is a major issue that directly affects the country's resources and governance,\" he said. He added that there was a need to make Islamabad a model city in terms of human rights, law and order, and cleanliness. For this, he said, all provinces and stakeholders must work together. On the issue of laws, Senator Tarar said that legislation to prevent child labour was already in place. However, he stressed the importance of proper enforcement. \"Strong implementation of these laws will help curb forced labour among children,\" he said. He added that raising awareness is not only a policy matter but also a moral responsibility. \"We must create a society where children are protected, educated and allowed to grow in a safe environment,\" he said. Tarar acknowledged that child labour was often linked to poverty and lack of access to education. He said that unless these root causes were addressed, the problem would persist. He also underlined the need for coordination between government departments, civil society and international partners. The federal minister said that ensuring children's rights was essential for the country's future. \"These children will grow up to become the workforce, the leaders and the citizens of tomorrow,\" he said. Participants at the event included government officials, child rights activists, students and representatives of civil society. Speakers discussed the challenges faced by children, particularly those who are pushed into work at an early age. Many shared the view that awareness campaigns and stronger institutional support were needed to end child labour. It was also noted that a lack of education, health facilities and social safety nets are contributing factors. Some speakers called for better data collection on child labour, so that targeted interventions could be designed. Others stressed the need for community-based monitoring systems and regular inspections of workplaces. Senator Tarar said that the government would continue to work with provinces and relevant institutions to improve child protection systems. He said policies will be reviewed and updated to reflect the current situation. He also encouraged young people to take part in community-based campaigns. \"Change starts from the ground. Youth engagement is vital in spreading awareness and creating a culture that respects children's rights,\" he said. While concluding his speech, Senator Tarar reaffirmed the government's commitment to fulfilling its national and international obligations regarding child protection. \"Pakistan is a signatory to various conventions on child rights. We are responsible for making sure that these commitments are honoured in practice,\" he said.",
