The decisions were made during a high-level meeting chaired by CDA Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa at the CDA headquarters. The meeting, attended by Member Planning, Member Finance, DG Building Control, DG Law, and other senior officers, reviewed the progress of ongoing anti-encroachment efforts. Chairman Randhawa directed authorities to take strict and indiscriminate action against illegal constructions in accordance with the law to ensure the timely completion of development projects.
