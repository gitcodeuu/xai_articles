    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP): Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Thursday said that children were the future of the nation and protecting them from forced labor was a shared responsibility of all. \"Child labour is a serious social issue and a crime,\" he said in his message on the World Day Against Child Labour. He emphasized that child labour was a major barrier to securing a safe and bright future for children. He reaffirmed that the Constitution of Pakistan guaranteed the protection and improved standard of living for children. \"Every child has the right to education, protection, play and healthy development,\" said the Speaker. Ayz Sadiq highlighted that providing a safe and labour-free environment for children is a collective responsibility. He said that the Parliament was committed to safeguarding the rights of children and had enacted effective legislation to prevent child labour and protect children's rights. The Speaker said a Parliamentary Caucus on Child Rights has been established in the National Assembly to prioritize the protection of children's rights. \"This caucus is playing an active role in ensuring the enforcement of children's rights across the country,\" he said. He urged the media, civil society and the general public to work together for the complete eradication of child labour in Pakistan. Ayaz Sadiq also noted that the Parliamentary Caucus on Child Rights has compiled a special report aimed at bringing out-of-school children back into the education system.",
