    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP):The Assistive Technology and Inclusion Summit (ATIS-2025), themed \"Transformative Solutions for Inclusive Development: The Role of Innovation in Fueling an Accessible and Equitable World,\" was successfully held at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) on Thursday, bringing together over 200 changemakers, experts, and stakeholders from across Pakistan. Jointly organized by NUST and the Pak Everbright Development Organization (PEDO), the summit served as a critical platform to address the growing need for assistive technologies, especially digital devices, aimed at enhancing the quality of life for differently-abled individuals and senior citizens. The event underscored the importance of bridging the gap between users and service providers, raising awareness, and ensuring the cost-effective availability and maintenance of assistive devices within the country. A major highlight of the summit was a high-level panel discussion titled \"Innovation for Accessibility: The Role of Academia, Industry, and Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) in Advancing Inclusion.\" The session featured thought leaders and industry professionals who shared insightful perspectives on current resources, challenges, and collaborative strategies to foster an inclusive future. Adding to the summit's milestones was the inauguration of the NUST Disability Resource Center (NDRC). Launched in collaboration with PEDO, the center aims to promote inclusive education at the tertiary level and provide an accessible and supportive environment for differently-abled students. \"ATIS-2025 marks a significant step towards a truly inclusive society in Pakistan,\" stated Shahab Ud Din, CEO of PEDO. \"Our collective efforts today will ignite further research and development, and empower stakeholders to drive digital innovation for accessibility,\" he added. Ahmad Al-Mosa Al-Malkawi, Head of the Physical Rehabilitation Programme (PRP) at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), praised the initiative, emphasizing that the ICRC recognizes the vital role of physical rehabilitation and assistive technology in empowering persons with disabilities. \"ATIS-2025 has provided an invaluable platform to share knowledge, foster collaboration, and accelerate inclusive solutions,\" he remarked. Expected outcomes from the summit include the initiation of pilot projects for assistive technology research, the establishment of a robust referral mechanism linking beneficiaries with service providers, and enhanced data collection on the needs and availability of assistive devices in Pakistan. This landmark summit aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), reinforcing Pakistan's commitment to inclusive and equitable development on a global scale.",
