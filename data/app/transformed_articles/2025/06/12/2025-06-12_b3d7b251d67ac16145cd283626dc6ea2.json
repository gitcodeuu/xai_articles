    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP): The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday organized a colorful Mango Festival here, bringing together members of the diplomatic corps and their families in a celebration of Pakistan's national fruit. The event served as a unique platform for cultural exchange and informal diplomacy and a tasteful reminder of the country's soft power and cultural diplomacy. Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan was the chief guest of the event who highlighted the importance of mangoes-not only as Pakistan's national fruit but also as a symbol of friendship and goodwill. \"Pakistan's mangoes are among the finest in the world. Through this festival, we aim to share a cherished part of our culture with our friends in the diplomatic community,\" Jam Kamal said in his brief remarks. He said that while Pakistan is among the top producers of mangoes, there is still significant untapped potential in the mango industry that needs to be explored. He also referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's 'mango diplomacy', emphasizing how the country's signature fruit is being used to strengthen diplomatic ties and promote a positive image of Pakistan internationally. Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch on the occasion highlighted the significance of the event as a celebration of Pakistan's iconic fruit - the mango, often referred to as the 'king of fruits'. She noted that Pakistan is the fifth-largest producer of mangoes in the world, that shows the country's strong agricultural potential. She further emphasized the government's commitment to modernizing the agriculture sector, with a focus on enhancing the export of value-added agricultural products. The goal, she said, is to empower farmers and exporters to compete effectively in international markets. She also thanked the Chief Executive Officer of the Serena Hotels Aziz Boolani for supporting the ministry in organizing the event. During the event, guests were treated to an exquisite variety of mangoes from across Pakistan, including Sindhri, Chaunsa, Anwar Ratol, and Langra. The event also featured mango-based desserts and drinks.",
