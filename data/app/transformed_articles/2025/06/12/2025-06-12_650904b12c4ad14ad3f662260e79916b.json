    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 11 (APP):The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has taken decisive action against financial defaulters while pushing forward with key infrastructure projects across the federal capital. During a high-level meeting chaired by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, on Wednesday who also serves as Chief Commissioner Islamabad and DG Civil Defence, officials outlined a comprehensive strategy to improve the authority's financial position and accelerate development works. The meeting, attended by CDA's Member Admin, Member Estate, Member Engineering, Member Finance and other senior officers, reviewed the authority's financial standing. Chairman Randhawa directed the DG Recovery to implement a rigorous action plan for recovering outstanding dues, warning that strict measures including heavy penalties and property allotment cancellations would be enforced against defaulters. Development projects in several sectors received special attention, with immediate completion orders issued for ongoing work in Sector E-12. The chairman mandated swift action against illegal encroachments in Sectors E-12 and C-15, while directing authorities to finalize the land award process in Sector C-16 to facilitate plot distribution to allottees. In a move to enhance recreational facilities, the CDA chief ordered expedited construction and operationalization of both Capital Food Street and Blue Area Food Street, with emphasis on maintaining high quality standards. Simultaneously, a major upgrade program was approved for Islamabad's graveyards, particularly Sector H-11, encompassing infrastructure improvements, modern lighting installation, and the establishment of a 24/7 public helpline for burial-related services. Anticipating future needs, the Planning Wing was instructed to identify suitable land for a new graveyard to accommodate the capital's growing population.",
