According to the Met Office, moist currents were currently penetrating the upper parts of the country, while a westerly wave was also likely to approach the region on June 13. Under the influence of these weather systems, duststorms and rain-thundershowers, accompanied by isolated hailstorms, are expected in Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree, Galliyat, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Malakand, Mansehra, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, and Abbottabad from June 13-16 with occasional gaps.
