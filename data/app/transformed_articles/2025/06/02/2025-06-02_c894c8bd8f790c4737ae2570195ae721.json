    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP): Capital Development Authority (CDA) has announced sweeping measures against illegal housing and cooperative societies operating in the federal capital. The decision was made during a high-level meeting chaired by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, on Monday. Senior officials including CDA board members, planning directors, and enforcement officers attended the session. It was decided that the CDA will immediately publish a comprehensive list of unauthorized housing societies in major newspapers and on its official website. aWe want every citizen to easily verify a societyas legal status before investing their hard-earned money,a stated a CDA spokesperson. Authorities have imposed a complete ban on construction material sales to illegal societies. Building material suppliers must now verify a societyas approved layout plan and valid No-Objection Certificate (NOC) before any transaction. Violators will face strict legal consequences. The crackdown particularly targets societies involved in illegal plot transfers and those avoiding mandatory CDA transfer fees. aThese unauthorized developments not only cheat investors but also create urban planning nightmares,a explained the spokesperson. The measures come after increasing complaints about fraudulent housing schemes cheating thousands of citizens. The CDA urges the public to always cross-check any property investment through their official channels before making payments. For verification of housing societies and regular updates, citizens can visit the CDAas official website or contact their helpline.",
