    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP):Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi on Monday announced that Pakistan Railways will run five special trains and offer a 20 percent discount on fares during the three days of Eid-ul-Azha. Speaking to the media, the minister described the last 11 months as a remarkable period for Pakistan Railways, saying the department had shown strong progress. He shared that revenue had reached Rs83 billion, mainly due to better operations, especially in the past four months. He said Rs42 billion was earned from passenger trains, Rs29 billion from freight services, and Rs13 billion from other sources. For the first time in its history, Pakistan Railways is now able to pay salaries and medical expenses of its staff from its own revenue. Abbasi highlighted that freight services are a key source of income globally. To improve efficiency, the ministry plans to outsource these operations. He also noted that leased railway land is contributing to revenue, while the Royal Palm Golf and Country Club is being outsourced through a transparent process under the Prime Minister's vision. He said Rs1 billion has been allocated to upgrade eight railway hospitals, which will also be outsourced. Railway employees will continue to receive free treatment, while non-employees will pay for services.Fourteen railway schools are also being outsourced. These schools will offer facilities similar to private institutions, and children of railway staff will pay fees based on special terms. Abbasi said infrastructure improvements are also underway. Cleanliness has improved at Chaklala and Margalla stations, and food services are being strictly monitored with the support of all four provincial food authorities. To enhance passenger experience, front-desk and train hostess services will be introduced. An anti-encroachment drive based on the Punjab model will be launched to reclaim valuable railway land, including station yards, commercial, residential, and agricultural areas. He said the Punjab government is fully backing these efforts. Several projects that had been stalled since 2016 are now being revived. As part of the Green Pakistan initiative, trees will be planted along railway tracks. The minister also announced a Rs45 billion development plan for Punjab, aiming to increase train speeds to 60 km per hour. He said 1,413 new wagons would be produced to support these goals. A new passenger train between Lahore and Narowal will start operating on June 15, the same day a freight train bound for Russia will be dispatched via Multan and Sindh. Abbasi added that work is also progressing on a rail link with Kazakhstan. These projects, he said, are crucial for transporting resources from Reko Diq and Thar Coal fields. He confirmed the closure of three inactive companies related to freight and audit operations and said that Margalla Railway Station would be modernized. Abbasi reaffirmed the government's commitment to honoring all agreements with the media and expressed confidence in a promising future for Pakistan Railways.",
