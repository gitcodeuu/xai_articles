    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP): Pakistan took part in the IV International Legal Forum \"Tashkent Law Spring,\" held in Uzbekistan, which commenced on May 29, 2025. The high-profile global gathering brought together over 1,500 participants, including ministers of justice, senior judges, legal scholars, and international experts from across the globe. The Pakistani delegation was led by Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, Federal Minister for Law and also included Barrister Syed Shahroz Bakhtiyar, Consultant at the Ministry of Law and Justice. This year's forum, themed \"The Digital Age: A Legal Look into the Future,\" explored cutting-edge issues at the intersection of law and technology-from AI in arbitration to blockchain, digital governance, and legal tech transformation. The Minister for Law and Justice addressed the plenary session, spotlighting Pakistan's legal reforms in the digital sphere and reaffirming its commitment to rights-based innovation and international legal cooperation. On the sidelines, the Minister for Law held high-level bilateral meetings with counterparts from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Turkiye, with discussions focused on judicial modernization, digital legal services, and regional collaboration. A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed between the Minister for Law and Justice of Pakistan and the Minister of Justice of Uzbekistan to formalize future cooperation and launch a joint working programme between the two ministries. The \"Tashkent Law Spring\" has rapidly emerged as a premier international platform shaping the global conversation on law in the digital age-and Pakistan's presence underscored its growing role in that dialogue.",
