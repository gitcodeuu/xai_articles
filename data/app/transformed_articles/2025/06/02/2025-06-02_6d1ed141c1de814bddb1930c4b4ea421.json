    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 2 (APP): The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) of Islamabad on Monday adjourned the hearing of protest-related cases against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) founder due to his absence. Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra of the Anti-Terrorism Court adjourned the hearing of protest-related cases after the PTI founder did not appear before the court. The hearing was scheduled as part of ongoing proceedings in cases registered against him and others at the Bara Kahu police station. During the hearing, no progress was made due to the PTI founder's unavailability. The court, taking note of his absence, decided to delay the proceedings without taking any action. The judge ordered that the PTI founder must attend the next hearing through video link, and instructed the authorities to ensure this arrangement is in place. The next hearing is scheduled for June 16.",
