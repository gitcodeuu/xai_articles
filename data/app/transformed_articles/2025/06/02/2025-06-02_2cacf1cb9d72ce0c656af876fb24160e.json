    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Monday highlighting the long diplomatic tradition of Italy said Pakistan look to Italy as an important country which could play the role of peace builder in the volatile regional and global scenario. Addressing the celebration ceremony of Italy's National Day, he said Pakistan and Italy share a rich history of diplomatic relations founded on mutual trust, cooperation and a commitment to global peace and development. \"We greatly value our relationship with Italy and strive to establish a comprehensive, long-term partnership, in the areas of trade and investment, security, education, and migration and labour mobility,\" he added. The minister, on behalf of the Government and people of Pakistan, extended warm felicitations to the friendly people and government of Italy on their National Day. \"Pakistan and Italy have completed 75 years of bilateral relations and our ties continue to develop in the positive direction,\" Tarar noted. He said the Italian Interior Minister visited Pakistan last month to sign an important bilateral MoU on migration and labour mobility. His visit to Pakistan amid the regional tension \"is a reflection of the strength of our bilateral relations.\" \"We have a robust dialogue architecture under the Strategic Engagement Plan (SEP) signed between the two countries in 2013,\" he said, adding both countries are keen on maintaining regular dialogue, including political and economic. The last session of the political dialogue was held in February this year, he said, adding Pakistan looks forward to hosting the next session of Pakistan-Italy Joint Economic Commission. He said Italy has remained an important partner of Pakistan in trade, and commercial spheres. \"It is satisfying to note that Pakistan-Italy bilateral trade has crossed the 1 billion dollar mark.\" It is a matter of satisfaction that a number of Italian companies are operating in Pakistan, he added. The minister said Italy has become an attractive destination in European Union for Pakistani students. An estimated 3500 students are studying in Italy, mostly in La Sapienza University in Rome. \"On this happy occasion, we wish to commend the untiring efforts of Ambassador Armellin and her team for strengthening the mutually beneficial partnership between Pakistan and Italy\" he remarked.",
