    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP):The National Assembly Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination has called for tighter regulation of private hospitals and accountability across healthcare institutions. The committee meeting which was held under the chairmanship of Dr. Mahesh Kumar Malani, MNA, reviewed the performance of the Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority (IHRA) and voiced concerns over unregulated pricing practices in private hospitals. Members emphasized the need for collaboration with provincial healthcare commissions, particularly in Punjab, to establish standardized pricing frameworks. IHRA was directed to submit a complete list of private hospitals, regulatory details, and updates on pending inquiries. To address regulatory shortcomings, a sub-committee was constituted under the convenership of Dr. Amjad Ali Khan, MNA. Members of the sub-committee included MNAs Ms. Sabheen Ghoury, Dr. Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro, and Dr. Shaista Khan. The body will evaluate IHRA's regulatory framework and monitor agreements with private hospitals to ensure compliance with public welfare obligations. The committee also reviewed the operations of the National Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine (NIRM), acknowledging its contributions while pointing out concerns related to hygiene, doctor availability, and patient care. Recommendations were made to improve staffing, cleanliness, and equitable distribution of resources. On the legislative front, discussion on the Pharmacy (Amendment) Bill, 2024-moved by MNA Abdul Qadir Patel-was deferred due to the absence of the Minister in charge. However, the bill is expected to be taken up in the next meeting, with Dr. Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro authorized to present it on the mover's behalf. The committee also discussed polio eradication efforts and pharmaceutical quality control, while stressing the need for budget transparency and performance audits. Chairperson Dr. Malani commended progress made but underlined the urgency of ensuring accountability and timely reforms in the health sector. The meeting was attended by several MNAs both in person and virtually, along with the Minister and senior officials from the Ministry of Health and its attached departments.",
