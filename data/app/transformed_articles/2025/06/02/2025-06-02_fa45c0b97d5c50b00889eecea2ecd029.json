    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP):Chairperson of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid, visited the BISP payment centre located at Central Park Housing Scheme on Kasur Road, Lahore to directly interact with beneficiaries and address their concerns. Speaking on the occasion, Senator Rubina Khalid emphasized that her visit aimed to hear people's issues firsthand and ensure timely solutions. \"We are here to understand your problems directly and take immediate steps for their redressal,\" she said. She urged beneficiaries not to visit payment centres unless they receive a message from 8171 to avoid unnecessary crowding, said a news release. Highlighting the importance of education, Senator Khalid advised parents to equip their children with both traditional and vocational education to empower them for a better future. \"This programme is named after Shaheed Benazir Bhutto - be fearless like her,\" she remarked, encouraging women to stand up for their rights. She reiterated that the full payment is the rightful entitlement of beneficiaries. \"No one has the right to deduct even a single rupee. If someone is involved in deduction, report immediately.\" Senator Rubina Khalid clarified that there is no fee for the BISP survey and that citizens must bring their CNIC, children's B-form, electricity bill, and an active mobile number for survey registration. She also announced that the quarterly Kafaalat installment has been increased from Rs. 10,500 to Rs. 13,500. \"Count your money thoroughly before leaving and don't forget to collect your receipt,\" she advised. In case of any deduction or misconduct, she urged beneficiaries to immediately call the BISP helpline at 0800-26477. \"Strict action will be taken against those involved in deductions. They will be punished in a way that they won't be able to face the public again,\" she warned.",
