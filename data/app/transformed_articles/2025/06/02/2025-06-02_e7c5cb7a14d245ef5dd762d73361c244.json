With Pakistan among the countries participating in the multi-country FSPC initiative, the study aims to enhance alignment and coherence of policies across sectors to accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2: Zero Hunger. In her opening remarks, Ms. Farrah Naz, Country Director, GAIN Pakistan, emphasized the urgency of integrated policy action. \"Fragmented policies were no longer sufficient to meet today's complex food system challenges. This workshop marks an important milestone in fostering dialogue across sectors and grounding our analysis in local realities,\" she added.

The workshop created a space for cross-sector collaboration and joint analysis, contributing to a stronger evidence base for future action. Faiz Rasool, Head of Policy and Advocacy at GAIN, highlighted the broader vision and said that this is more than a validation workshop-it is a step toward a nationally owned process of building policy coherence to transform Pakistan's food system.
