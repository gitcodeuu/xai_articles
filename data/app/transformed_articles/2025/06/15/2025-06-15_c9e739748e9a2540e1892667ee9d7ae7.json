    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 15 (APP):The Islamabad Transport Authority has started a citywide crackdown on vehicles that emit smoke. According to the spokesman of ICT administration here, under the new enforcement plan, daily inspections are being carried out, and action is being taken on the spot against violators. According to ICT administration officials, the transport authority inspected 50 vehicles on the first day of the operation. Out of these, four were shifted to the police station for causing significant pollution, while 25 drivers were issued warnings for violating emission standards. Chairman of the Islamabad Transport Authority, Irfan Nawaz Memon, stated that the campaign will continue on a daily basis. He said that there will be no leniency toward vehicles contributing to air pollution. A zero-tolerance policy will be followed, and those found guilty will face strict action, including heavy fines and possible impoundment of their vehicles. Chairman Memon also urged residents of Islamabad to report vehicles emitting smoke. \"Public cooperation is important to make this campaign successful,\" he said. \"If citizens spot a smoke-emitting vehicle, they should report it to the relevant authorities so that immediate action can be taken.\" He added that such vehicles not only damage the environment but also pose health risks to the general public. He reiterated that any driver operating a smoke-emitting vehicle will be fined, and in serious cases, the vehicle will be taken off the road. The chairman emphasized that environmental protection is a shared responsibility, and the role of the public is crucial in identifying violators. The Islamabad Transport Authority will continue monitoring across major roads and intersections in the capital. This campaign is part of broader efforts by the administration to reduce pollution in the federal capital. Officials say that such operations will be made more effective with public involvement and better surveillance. The authority plans to expand the operation to cover industrial vehicles, buses, and other forms of public transport. Inspections will not be limited to one-time action but will form part of a regular enforcement strategy. Citizens have also been asked to ensure their own vehicles meet emission standards. Vehicle owners are being encouraged to get their vehicles checked and maintained regularly to avoid penalties. Officials concluded that this campaign reflects the city's commitment to clean air and a healthier environment for all residents.",
