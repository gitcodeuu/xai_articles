    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 15 (APP):The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) serve over 40,000 new cancer patients each year, collectively performing an impressive 1 million diagnostic and treatment procedures. PAEC is at the forefront of the nation's battle against cancer, providing critical care through its extensive network of 20 Atomic Energy Cancer Hospitals (AECHs). In a statement released on Sunday by its Public Relations Directorate, PAEC underscored its six decades of unwavering commitment to cancer care, stating, \"With a legacy built on six decades of expertise, around 80% of Pakistan's all types of cancer patients are treated by PAEC's AECHs, offering advanced diagnostic and treatment services at highly subsidised rates.\" The statement further highlighted the advanced technological capabilities within the AECH network: \"Equipped with cutting-edge technology, our hospitals deliver comprehensive cancer management through specialized departments in Nuclear Medicine, Radiology, Radiation Oncology, and Medical Oncology. Our facilities boast state-of-the-art equipment, including PET-CT, SPECT-CT, Cyclotrons, Linear Accelerators, Cyber Knife, and Brachytherapy, complemented by modern MRI, CT scan, and digital X-ray systems.\" PAEC also emphasized its commitment to innovation, noting, \"We remain dedicated to adopting the latest advancements in cancer treatment, including sophisticated techniques such as Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), and the innovative field of Theranostics.\" The statement also acknowledged the crucial role of specialized personnel: \"Dedicated Medical Physicists' teams are integral to our operations, ensuring the highest levels of precision in treatment planning and radiation safety protocols. Furthermore, our integrated diagnostic laboratories provide rapid and reliable haematology, pathology, and chemical testing, essential for timely and accurate diagnoses.\" Looking towards the future, PAEC stressed its commitment to professional development: \"Capacity-building is a key priority for PAEC. We have trained over 2,600 healthcare professionals, including 250 doctors, through collaborations with the Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Sciences (PIEAS). Our AECHs are recognized by the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan, offering prestigious FCPS, MCPS, and DMRT programs in Nuclear Medicine, Radiology, and Oncology.\" Expanding its reach to underserved communities, the statement concluded: \"21st Atomic Energy Cancer Hospital is nearing completion in Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), which will significantly enhance access to vital cancer care in the region.\"",
