    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 15 (APP):President of the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI), Nasir Mansoor Qureshi, has emphasized that Pakistan's economic stability and growth depend on bold structural reforms, private sector empowerment and consistent, transparent policies to attract both local and foreign investment. Speaking as a guest at \"Freedom Gate Dialogues\" here Sunday, the flagship podcast series of Freedom Gate Prosperity (FGP) hosted by Urooj Raza Sayyami, Qureshi shared his vision for strengthening the role of the business community in shaping Pakistan's economic future. He stressed that the private sector must be recognized as a key driver of job creation, industrial expansion, and innovation, said a press release issued here on Sunday. Nasir Mansoor Qureshi highlighted the importance of consulting the industrial sector while finalizing budget policies. He further urged the government to create an enabling environment for the business community, particularly by facilitating investment in the manufacturing sector. He welcomed the government's recently announced five-year tariff reform plan, describing it as a \"transformative initiative\" with the potential to boost Pakistan's exports by several billion dollars-provided it is implemented transparently and in alignment with market needs. Qureshi also underscored the need to simplify regulations, streamline business licensing procedures, and reduce bureaucratic hurdles to improve the overall investment climate. Highlighting the pivotal role of youth and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), he called for targeted support in areas such as skills development, technology adoption, and access to global markets to unlock Pakistan's full economic potential. He congratulated Muhammad Anwar, CEO of FGP, and his team for launching Freedom Gate Dialogues, expressing hope that the podcast will raise awareness on critical economic and development issues and promote informed public discourse. Qureshi also mentioned the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently signed between ICCI and FGP to advance shared goals in economic empowerment and climate change resilience. The episode further highlighted ICCI's ongoing initiatives to foster public-private partnerships, improve industrial infrastructure, and ensure effective representation of the business community's interests in policymaking.",
