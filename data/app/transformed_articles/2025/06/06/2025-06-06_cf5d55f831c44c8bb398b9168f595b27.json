In line with the State Bank of Pakistan's vision to promote digital financial inclusion, JazzCash is facilitating QR-based payments at 27 cattle markets across 12 cities nationwide said a news release . This initiative replaces traditional cash transactions with seamless digital payments, ensuring safety, transparency, and convenience for cattle farmers, merchants, and buyers alike.
