    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 06 (APP): Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Muhammad Shoaib Khan, chaired an important meeting with officers of the Industrial Area Zone to review Eid security arrangements and strategize on crime prevention. An official told APP on Friday that the meeting was attended by SP Industrial Area Khan Zeb, SDPOs, and SHOs of the zone. The SSP issued strict instructions to ensure the safety of citizens in markets and cattle markets during Eid and to keep a close watch on individuals with criminal records. SSP Shoaib said all officers must intensify patrolling efforts and use all available resources to eliminate criminal elements from the area. He directed that a crackdown be launched to arrest proclaimed offenders and those involved in serious crimes. SSP Shoaib said legal action should be taken indiscriminately against those involved in one-wheeling, hooliganism, and aerial firing. Officers were instructed to ensure all cases are investigated on merit and that solid evidence is compiled to secure strict punishments for arrested suspects. SSP Shoaib said all SHOs must address public complaints at the police station level on a priority basis. Strict action would be taken against any misconduct or misuse of authority, he warned. SSP emphasized that officers must maintain exemplary discipline and remain committed to protecting the lives and property of citizens, which remains the department's top priority. Negligence in this regard will not be tolerated under any circumstances, he added.",
