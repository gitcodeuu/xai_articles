    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 6 (APP): A Pakistani delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, comprising former Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and Senator Sherry Rehman Friday asserted that India's narrative has crumbled under global scrutiny, stressing that contentious issues like Kashmir demand meaningful dialogue to forge lasting resolutions. Senator Sherry Rehman cautioned India in an exclusive conversation with a private news channel that failure to engage in dialogue would lead to dire consequences and that the country has already faced the consequences of its previous actions. Pakistan is a peace-loving nation that is acting with maturity, and any rash actions by India will have consequences, Senator Sherry Rehman said. According to Jalil Abbas Jilani, Pakistan's narrative is winning global support, leaving dialogue as the sole viable option for India's Modi government. He stressed that India and Pakistan should engage in dialogue to resolve disputes over Kashmir and water issues, noting that India is already experiencing setbacks across the board. He emphasized that Pakistan's narrative resonating globally and earning appreciation is a major achievement and a marker of success. Both members of delegation lauded Bilawal Bhutto's diplomatic initiatives and expressed their confidence that India's stance is currently embroiled in difficulties.",
