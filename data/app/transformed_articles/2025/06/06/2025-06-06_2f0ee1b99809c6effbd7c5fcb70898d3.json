    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 6 (APP): The Capital Development Authority (CDA), Islamabad Police, and district administration on Friday finalized a joint action plan to ensure foolproof security, traffic management, and efficient waste disposal across the city during Eid-ul-Azha. The decisions were made during a high-level meeting chaired by CDA Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa, along with Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, at the Safe City Headquarters, with senior officials from various departments in attendance. Authorities have activated a dedicated control room to monitor security and cleanliness operations through Safe City cameras and drone surveillance. Over 895 police personnel will be deployed across the city, with special checkpoints established at key locations including Shah Faisal Mosque, imambargahs, parks, commercial centers, and graveyards to ensure public safety. For waste management, the CDA's sanitation department will deploy 2,500 workers along with modern machinery to handle sacrificial waste. Biodegradable plastic bags were being distributed citywide to encourage proper disposal. Residents have been advised to place waste outside their homes or contact the CDA helpline at 1334 for immediate collection. Strict measures have been announced against illegal activities, including unauthorized cattle markets and hide collection camps. The Chief Commissioner Randhawa directed law enforcement to take action against beggars and imposed a complete ban on swimming in dams and canals to prevent accidents. Park administrations have been instructed to ensure the safety of swings and recreational facilities. Special arrangements have been made for graveyard cleanliness and security to accommodate visitors during the festive period. The administration has activated helplines and WhatsApp services for public complaints and emergencies. Randhawa emphasized the importance of inter-departmental coordination, stating that the Safe City system and modern technology would be fully utilized to ensure a secure and clean Eid for all citizens. With these comprehensive measures in place, Islamabad aims to provide residents with a safe, hygienic, and well-organized environment throughout the Eid-ul-Azha celebrations.",
