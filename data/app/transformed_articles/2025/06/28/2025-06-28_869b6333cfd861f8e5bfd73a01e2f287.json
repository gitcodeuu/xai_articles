    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 28 (APP):Pakistan has launched the implementation of a US $18.7 million project under the Pandemic Fund to strengthen its pandemic preparedness and response systems. Supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the initiative will establish \"One Health Units\" across the country through a coordinated approach linking human, animal, and environmental health sectors. Led by the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination and supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH), the initiative emphasizes the urgent need for integrated action across human, animal, and environmental health systems. The launch event, held in Islamabad, brought together over 70 stakeholders, including senior government officials from the Ministries of Health, Food Security, and Climate Change, as well as representatives from provincial authorities and development partners. \"The Pandemic Fund presents a critical opportunity for countries like Pakistan to bolster their national health security. The integration of the One Health approach will enable us to build resilient systems that can detect and respond to complex health threats, including zoonotic spillovers and antimicrobial resistance,\" said Dr Shabana Saleem, Director General of Health. Pakistan's strategy aligns with the National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS) and the International Health Regulations (IHR), prioritizing the One Health approach to address the fact that over 75% of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate from animals-risks further exacerbated by climate change and growing antimicrobial resistance. The One Health Units will strengthen coordinated disease surveillance, early warning systems, cross-sectoral data sharing, laboratory capacity, and workforce training. These units will be embedded within existing government systems and guided by clear mandates and governance frameworks. \"The Pandemic Fund allows us to move from planning to action, from commitment to coordination,\" said Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan. \"It provides a chance to operationalize long-standing goals for zoonotic disease control, food safety, and antimicrobial resistance management.\" Dr Dapeng Luo, WHO Representative in Pakistan, emphasized the urgency of the effort: \"The COVID-19 pandemic was a stark reminder that building stronger health systems is no longer optional. WHO is committed to working alongside Pakistan and its partners to save lives when the next health threat emerges.\" The event concluded with a joint commitment to establish a National One Health Secretariat, supported by corresponding coordination mechanisms at the provincial level. These structures will serve as permanent platforms for joint action across sectors. \"It is an honor for NIH to host the One Health Secretariat,\" said Dr Muhammad Salman, CEO of NIH. \"This initiative will significantly enhance our core capacities-especially in surveillance, laboratory systems, and workforce development-ensuring that we are better prepared for whatever comes next.\" In addition to the US$18.7 million from the Pandemic Fund, the initiative has mobilized US$4.1 million in co-financing and US$49.7 million in co-investment, underscoring strong national and international commitment to building a safer, healthier future.",
