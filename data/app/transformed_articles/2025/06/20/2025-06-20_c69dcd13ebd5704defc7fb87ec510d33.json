    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 20 (APP): Additional Secretary (Asia-Pacific) Ambassador Imran Ahmed Siddiqui addressed the 6th China-South Asia Cooperation Forum (CSACF) in Kunming and underscored Pakistan's unwavering commitment to multilateralism guided by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Speaking at the Forum under the theme \"Join Hands for Open and Inclusive Development,\" the additional secretary reaffirmed that peace and development were mutually reinforcing pillars for building a stable and prosperous region. Lauding China's leadership in hosting the Forum, Ambassador Siddiqui noted that high-quality development under Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), exemplified by its flagship project of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), has transformed the socio-economic landscape of the region. Highlighting the critical need for inclusive and sustainable development, the Additional Secretary outlined Pakistan's development vision anchored in enhanced regional connectivity, sustainable use of marine resources, climate resilience and technological innovation. He emphasized that lasting regional peace in the region could not be achieved without addressing and resolving long-standing disputes, particularly in territories under foreign occupation. He called for adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence centered on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference, equality and peaceful resolution of disputes, as the cornerstone for regional cooperation. Emphasizing the role of emerging technologies in shaping South Asia's future, Ambassador Siddiqui urged greater collaboration in digital infrastructure, artificial intelligence and innovation-led growth. He underscored the imperative of undertaking coordinated regional efforts in combating climate change, disaster preparedness and joint management of shared water resources, warning against any unilateral attempts to weaponize water. The Additional Secretary also proposed the establishment of China-South Asia Development Forum (CSADF) which could serve as a high-level mechanism to advance practical cooperation in priority areas driving shared prosperity and inclusive development in the region.",
