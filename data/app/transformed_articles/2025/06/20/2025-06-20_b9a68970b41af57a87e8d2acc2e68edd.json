    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 20 (APP): On World Refugee Day, June 20, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the world to show stronger support for millions of refugees forced to flee war, disaster, and persecution. In his message, he highlighted the deep loss refugees face, as well as the growing challenges of closed borders and rising xenophobia. \"From Sudan to Ukraine, from Haiti to Myanmar, people are running for their lives - while support is dwindling,\" he said. He noted that developing countries host most of the world's refugees and called this burden \"unfair and unsustainable.\" Despite hardship, refugees show great courage and resilience. Guterres emphasized that, when supported, they contribute positively to society. He called on the international community to turn words into action by providing more aid, protecting the right to asylum, offering resettlement options, and ensuring refugees are included in shaping their futures. \"Becoming a refugee is never a choice,\" he said. \"But how we respond is. Let us choose solidarity. Let us choose humanity.\"",
