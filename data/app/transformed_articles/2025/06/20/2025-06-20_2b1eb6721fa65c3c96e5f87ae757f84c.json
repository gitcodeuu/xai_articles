    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 20 (APP):Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Khalil Tahir said that Pakistan has always played a crucial role in combating terrorism in the region and continues to advocate for peace, prosperity, and development. Speaking to media outside the Parliament House, the senator stated that Pakistan sacrificed over 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism, in addition to suffering billions of dollars in economic losses. He emphasized that the international community must take a proactive role in addressing the Iran-Israel conflict, warning that the region cannot bear the burden of another war. \"Pakistan has always stood for peace and regional stability,\" he said, noting that the country has consistently contributed to global efforts against terrorism. Commenting on the recent meeting between Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff and U.S. President Donald Trump, Senator Khalil expressed optimism, saying the engagement could open new avenues for trade and strengthen bilateral relations. \"Pakistan holds significant importance at the international level,\" he added. \"We were among the most reliable allies of the United States in the fight against terrorism.\" He reaffirmed that China remains Pakistan's strategic partner and that the friendship between the two countries is strong and enduring.",
