    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 04 (APP): In a bid to combat rising air pollution, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), in partnership with the Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP), kicked off a year-long vehicle emission testing campaign on Wednesday. The drive is being conducted at three major locations: the I-9 Traffic Police Check Post, Tayyaba Steel Mills, and 7-Up Chowk in the I-9 Industrial Area.On the first day, 50 vehicles were inspected, revealing alarming levels of non-compliance with emission standards. Authorities issued fines to 11 vehicles for emitting smoke exceeding 70%, while three were impounded for dangerous emission levels above 80%. Another 20 vehicles received warnings for smoke levels between 40% and 50%. Only 16 vehicles met the acceptable emission range of 10% to 40%. The campaign highlights the government's push for stricter environmental regulations and public awareness on reducing vehicular pollution. Pak-EPA officials emphasized that sustained efforts will be made to monitor emissions and enforce compliance, ensuring cleaner air for the capital's residents. \"This initiative is crucial for safeguarding public health and the environment,\" said a Pak-EPA spokesperson. \"We urge vehicle owners to maintain their vehicles properly to avoid penalties.\" The campaign will continue for the rest of the year, with regular checks across the city.",
