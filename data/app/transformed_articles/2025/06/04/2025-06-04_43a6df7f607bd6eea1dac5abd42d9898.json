    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 04 (APP): The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Wednesday soft-launched the ambitious Gandhara Heritage and Citizen Center at F-9 Park, marking a new era of public-private collaboration in the federal capital. CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, who also serves as Chief Commissioner Islamabad and DG Civil Defense, presided over the ceremony attended by key CDA board members, leading hoteliers, investors, and renowned architect Nayyar Ali Dada. The pioneering project will operate under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, with design led by Nayyar Ali Dada & Associates. Officials confirmed the center will be fully operational by next fiscal year, with special emphasis on heritage preservation and maintaining green spaces. Chairman Randhawa called this a \"first-of-its-kind initiative for Islamabad,\" explaining that revenues generated will be reinvested in city beautification and F-9 Park upgrades. The project aligns with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi's policy of optimizing government assets. The CDA chief guaranteed strict regulatory compliance and announced a six-month completion deadline. He highlighted the project's potential to create employment opportunities by activating underutilized assets. Looking ahead, officials revealed plans for new hotel projects in premium locations starting July 2025, with more PPP ventures in the pipeline to support Islamabad's transformation into a model modern capital. The Authority has currently opened Expressions of Interest for investor participation, with project documents available at CDA headquarters. Chairman Randhawa emphasized this launch marks just the beginning of Islamabad's development journey, urging private sector participation to realize the capital's full potential. The Gandhara Heritage and Citizen Center will feature cultural exhibition spaces, sustainable architecture, citizen recreation facilities, and commercial zones for local businesses, creating a multifaceted public space in the heart of the city.",
