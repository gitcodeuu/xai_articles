    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 04 (APP):Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (R) Syed Zeeshan Haider on Wednesday visited the Zia Masjid Cattle Market to review traffic flow and parking arrangements ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. CTO Zeeshan told APP that six temporary cattle markets have been established in the federal capital for Eid, where Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) has deployed over 100 traffic officers to ensure smooth traffic management. CTO Zeeshan said that designated parking areas have been allocated for citizens in coordination with the district administration to facilitate visitors and avoid traffic congestion around the markets. CTO said parking vehicles on busy roads causes a serious disruption in the flow of traffic and creates difficulties for commuters. \"Vehicles found in violation of parking regulations will be shifted to nearby police stations, and their owners may be sent to the lock-up,\" warned CTO Zeeshan Haider. CTO Zeeshan said citizens are urged to use only the designated parking zones and fully cooperate with the Islamabad Traffic Police in maintaining traffic discipline during the Eid season.",
