    "article_body": "MAKKAH, Jun 4 (APP):The Municipality of the Holy Capital (Amanat Al-Asimah Al-Muqaddasah) has completed all sanitation arrangements in the holy sites for the Hajj season of 1446 AH. As part of efforts to modernize the cleaning system, the municipality has introduced several advanced facilities this year, including electric waste compactors, underground storage units, and state-of-the-art cleaning machinery. According to the municipal spokesperson, due to the increasing number of pilgrims and the limited space and time during Hajj, scientific and technical solutions have been implemented to enhance the efficiency of sanitation operations. In particular, the temporary waste storage system has been upgraded to meet modern standards, ensuring timely waste disposal during the pilgrimage. The municipality has installed 1,235 electric waste compactors, 113 underground storage units, 9 large waste compactor trucks, 4 transfer stations, and approximately 88,000 waste bins of various sizes throughout the holy sites. Over 13,500 personnel have been deployed for sanitation services, and the latest cleaning equipment, such as automated sweepers, dump trucks, loaders, and multi-purpose small vehicles, have been provided to ensure effective cleaning even in crowded areas. The municipality has confirmed that all facilities, field centers, staff, and equipment are fully prepared, and the operational plans are being executed to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in line with the presence and density of pilgrims. The primary goal is to provide the guests of Allah with a clean, safe, and peaceful environment so they can perform their rituals with ease and peace of mind. These efforts reflect the practical implementation of Saudi Vision 2030 goals, particularly in enhancing sanitation, environmental health, and public services.",
