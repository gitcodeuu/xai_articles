    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 4 (APP):On the World Environment Day, President Asif Ali Zardari urged every citizen, organization, and public institution to unite for a cleaner, greener Pakistan. In a message on the World Environment Day, he said they were reminded of their shared responsibility to protect the planet and secure a sustainable future for the generations to come. \"Pakistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Each year, we face devastating floods, droughts, and heatwaves that displace millions of people. Yet, our contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%. This imbalance highlights the urgent need for global climate justice and strong international support,\" President Secretariat Press Wing, in a press release, quoted the president as saying. Despite limited resources, the president said, Pakistan was taking steps to tackle environmental challenges. \"We are working to mobilize climate finance by combining national efforts with private investment and international support. Key strategic instruments include: The $1.4 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility from the IMF, which supports reforms such as a carbon levy, electric vehicle promotion, and improved energy efficiency: the World Bank's Country Partnership Framework (2026-2035), focused on flood resilience, clean energy transition, sustainable agriculture, and better air quality. The 2024 Carbon Market Policy Guidelines aim to attract green private investment. All these efforts align with Pakistan's broader economic transformation plan - Uraan Pakistan,\" he added. The president observed that the governments alone could not solve this crisis, stressing that each of them had a role to play. \"Let us commit to taking small, everyday actions that make a big difference - reducing single-use plastics, promoting forestation, recycling waste, and supporting policies that protect nature. Let us work together to address climate change, protect biodiversity, and use our natural resources wisely and responsibly,\" he emphasized.",
