    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 04 (APP):Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police have established special Help Desks across the federal capital to ensure timely guidance and immediate assistance during emergencies, while also supporting smooth public movement in cattle markets and commercial centers. An public relations officer told APP that the initiative was launched under the special directions of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, and implemented by Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Muhammad Jawad Tariq. He said the purpose of these Help Desks is to assist citizens during Eid season, particularly in cattle markets and busy trading areas, by deploying trained young officers and Lady Police Officers to respond effectively to public needs. DIG Tariq said these Help Desks will also play a vital role in taking action against professional beggars operating in commercial zones, ensuring a safer environment for both traders and shoppers. He said citizens can use these desks to obtain information or request prompt police assistance in case of emergencies. DIG said the Islamabad Police is committed to providing a secure environment for public and commercial activity, and the establishment of these Help Desks reflects efforts to protect citizens from harassment, illegal activities, and mobility challenges in high-traffic areas.",
