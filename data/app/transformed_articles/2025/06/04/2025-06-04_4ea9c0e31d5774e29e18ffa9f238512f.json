    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 4 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that Pakistan did defeat India comprehensively on multiple fronts - military, war of narratives and diplomacy. Addressing press conference, he said that Pakistan had responded to Indian aggression in an effective and responsible manner. He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif advocated Pakistan's stance on the diplomatic front in a comprehensive manner whereas team led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar also worked diligently on this front. Appreciating role of Pakistan media, anchors, journalists and media houses, he said they did play a vital role in projecting the narrative of war against India. Pakistani media carried out responsible journalism with facts and figures whereas Indian media resorted to concocted and fake news, he added. \" Indian media ran a misinformation campaign and it became a subject of ridicule at international level. Global media outlets quoted how ridiculous propaganda was aired by Indian media\", he said. On the contrary Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Inter Services Public Relations and media houses of Pakistan did play their role in an effective but responsible manner, he added. The minister said that Maarka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyan Marsus would always be remembered as great triumph since Allah Almighty honoured Pakistan against its enemy. In tense and critical situation, the Pakistani nation demonstrated exemplary solidarity and unity, Attaullah Tarar said adding under the leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan Armed Forces acted in a coordinated manner and foiled Indian nefarious designs. Attaullah Tarar said after defeat on every forum, India was now spreading false propaganda in an effort of face-saving. He said now even in India, questions were being raised about PM Modi's failed strategy. The minister said that New Delhi was involved in acts of terrorism in multiple countries including Pakistan as Indian state sponsored terrorism had reached Canada, America and Australia. Referring to proofs on Indian involvement in terrorist activities in Balochistan, he said Indian Navy serving commander Kulbhushan Jadhav was captured from Balochistan. He said India was funding terrorist acts in Balochistan but Pakistan was determined to eliminate all types of terrorism by defeating India proxies. The minister said terrorism in other countries was part of India's foreign policy, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had admitted that India supported Mukti Bahini in 1971. He said when Jafar Express train incident happened, Indians somehow celebrated hostage taking and Indian media had given special coverage to terrorists by showing their interviews live. He said when Pahalgam incident happened, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an impartial, transparent international investigation, but India did not respond as it would have exposed the false flag operation. Tarar expressed the determination that the Fitna-ul-Hindustan will be eliminated from Balochistan at all costs. During Attaullah Tarar's press conference, video evidence of Indian terrorism was also shown to media. It was titled \" Terror by Design: India's Proxy War on Pakistan\". The video showed Narendra Modi bragging about Indian support for Mukti Bahini in East Pakistan in 1971. Some clips of anti-Pakistan speeches of Indian Prime Minister and ministers were also shown in the video. The video contained clear evidence of India's involvement in terrorist incidents in Balochistan. \" Balochistan is Pakistan's lifeline, we will take the process of peace and stability forward,\" Attaullah Tarar remarked. The minister vowed that like a conventional war, Indian proxies will also be defeated. To a question, he said a Pakistan's diplomatic delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had held important meetings in New York with United Nations top brass and conveyed Pakistan's stance very effectively. The minister said that India's efforts to destabilize Balochistan will fail and development works in the province will gain momentum and it would play its role in the overall development of the country.",
