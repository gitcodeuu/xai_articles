    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 4 (APP): In a major initiative towards public procurement reform, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), Pakistan has successfully trained and certified 408 Master Trainers from federal government institutions under the Prime Minister's vision for good governance, efficiency, and transparency. Over the past one year, PPRA conducted 15 specialized training sessions to advance e-procurement adoption and strengthen compliance with procurement regulations, said a press release issued on Wednesday. A ceremony was held at PPRA Headquarters, where Managing Director PPRA, Hasnat Ahmed Qureshi awarded certificates to the participants. The certified trainers will now lead training sessions on the e-Pak Acquisition & Disposal System (EPADS) within their respective organizations, promoting a standardized and digital procurement approach across Pakistan. Addressing the participants, Qureshi emphasized the importance of capacity building, highlighting that for the first time in PPRA's history, a structured and comprehensive training initiative has been launched to institutionalize e-procurement. He further announced that PPRA is finalizing an accreditation framework to enhance capacity building and human resource development. He urged on Master Trainers to play an active role in procurement processes within their institutions, encouraging them to build capacity of their colleagues in effective EPADS utilization, which is set to revolutionize public procurement in Pakistan. The certificate distribution ceremony was attended by senior PPRA officials, including Atiq Sultan Raja, Senior Specialist - Capacity Building; Abdul Majeed, Senior Specialist - Monitoring & Evaluation; Farukh Bashir, Director - Training; and other officers. Aligned with the Prime Minister's vision, Procurement Cells are being established across federal ministries, divisions, attached departments, autonomous bodies, and state-owned entities. PPRA is implementing a comprehensive training program to ensure the effective implementation of EPADS and compliance with the Public Procurement Regulatory Framework.",
