    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 21 (APP): The Senate on Saturday forwarded a total of 204 recommendations for the fiscal year 2025-26 Finance Bill to the National Assembly, following eight days of extensive proceedings and meaningful participation from both the government and the opposition benches. The sessions saw strong representation from the government, including Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister of State for Finance Ali Pervaiz Malik, and Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, Secretary Finance Imdadullah Bosal, who not only reviewed the proposals but also provided clarifications and responses to queries raised by members. Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance conducted seven meetings during the budget week to finalize the recommendations. A total of 54 senators took part in the deliberations, including Leader of the Opposition Shibli Faraz, Senator Ali Zafar, and representatives from various parties who presented their suggestions. The proposals covered a broad spectrum of public concerns such as tax reforms, social welfare, tariff adjustments, and employment generation. These were compiled into a report and submitted for consideration by the National Assembly. In addition, members highlighted the significance of provincial fiscal domains, opposed indirect taxation on essential sectors, and urged for protective measures for vulnerable populations. Earlier, during the debate, the Finance Ministry was commended for its cooperation, as key ministers remained present throughout the sessions, ensuring transparency and open dialogue. The Senate secretariat noted that last year, 52 percent of its recommendations were accepted by the federal government, underscoring the Upper House's consultative value in shaping fiscal policy.",
