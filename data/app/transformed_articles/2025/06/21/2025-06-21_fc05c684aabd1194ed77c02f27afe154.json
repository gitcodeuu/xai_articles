    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 21 (APP): Lawmakers in the Senate on Saturday called for urgent relief measures for Pakistan's agriculture sector, marginalized regions and underprivileged communities, while also commended the the Senate Finance Committee for their robust contributions during the ongoing budget process. While concluding the discussion on Budget 2025-26, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Rana Mahmoodul Hassan stressed the need to prioritize the agricultural sector in the federal budget, urging the government to abolish taxes on local cotton and allocate appropriate funds for South Punjab, particularly Multan. He emphasized the urgency of formulating a long-term economic strategy in consultation with all stakeholders, stating, \"The prosperity of Pakistan hinges on bipartisan consensus and expert advice.\" Calling attention to the ongoing water crisis, Senator Hassan highlighted that 50% of cotton growers in Sindh have been unable to cultivate crops this season. \"We have declared a water emergency. It is time to develop coordinated short-, mid-, and long-term policies to address the crisis,\" he said. The senator also paid rich tributes to Pakistan's defense forces and scientific community, applauding their efforts during tensions with India. \"I salute Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Pakistan Air Force, Navy, and our scientists for giving a befitting reply to India. They are the pride of the nation,\" he added. He lauded PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari for his diplomatic efforts, asserting that he effectively represented Pakistan on the global stage. On the occasion of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto's birthday, he paid homage to the Bhutto family's sacrifices, remarking, \"Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto laid down their lives for the country. Dialogue is the only way forward.\" Senator Manzoor Kakar emphasized the importance of upholding democratic values, stating that whether in government or opposition, the responsibility to strengthen democracy lies with all representatives. He stressed that constructive criticism by the opposition, particularly during critical moments such as budget discussions, reflects the spirit of democratic engagement and the decorum of the parliamentary process, serving the best interests of the people. Senator Kakar lauded the leadership of Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla, noting that representatives from all political parties, including Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the State Minister, and senior officials, participated in extensive deliberations lasting nearly nine hours. He commended the committee for formulating non-partisan recommendations that were shaped by consensus, guided by public interest rather than political affiliations. Senator Shibli Faraz, acknowledged that the primary responsibility for the federal budget lies with the National Assembly, as it comprises directly elected representatives of the people. However, he noted that the Senate was not excluded from the process, highlighting that the Senate Finance Committee held regular, inclusive meetings with active participation from all political parties. Faraz termed the budget review a productive exercise, stating that each clause of the Finance Bill was thoroughly examined without any oversight. He praised the committee's collaborative approach, adding that significant proposals were put forward by members from across party lines and formally submitted for consideration. Commending the leadership of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla, he described him as a hardworking and capable leader. Despite the committee's efforts, Faraz expressed concern over the budget's direction, criticizing its heavy reliance on external loans. He warned that an economy based on borrowing undermines national sovereignty and limits independent policymaking. He further pointed out that the government had failed to curtail its own expenditures while continuing to impose taxes on already burdened segments of society. Senator Ali Zafar commended the efforts of the Senate Finance Committee, praising Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla and all participating members for conducting their work with diligence and a sense of responsibility. He expressed confidence that the committee's recommendations were thoughtfully crafted and effectively incorporated into the final report. Senator Dost Muhammad Khan voiced strong concern in the Senate over the neglect of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in the Finance Committee's recommendations. He noted that the only matter taken up regarding the region was the imposition of taxes, with no consideration for its socio-economic challenges. Calling FATA a frontline region in the fight against terrorism, he criticized the government for reversing the previous administration's ten-year tax exemption policy. He further pointed out that a promised land compensation of Rs. 450,000 per household-announced three years ago-has yet to be fully disbursed. \"While half the affected families have received payments for homes damaged or destroyed, the remaining victims are still waiting,\" he said, urging the Finance Minister to allocate funds in the upcoming budget to fulfill this commitment. Responding to the concerns, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb assured the House that budgetary allocations for the merged districts of FATA and PATA had not only been maintained but increased for the next fiscal year. He added that tax relief, particularly in income tax, continues, and the government is considering a phased approach to reforming the sales tax structure, including discussions around implementing a unified tax system over time. Senator Kamran Murtaza underscored the critical role of the Senate in the federal budget process, commending the Finance Committee for its dedication and inclusive approach. He particularly lauded Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla and his team for their tireless efforts, noting that they worked late into the night-up to eight hours-to finalize recommendations. Senator Murtaza emphasized that the recommendations adopted were based on merit and collective judgment, not party lines. \"This is a moment when individual conscience must take precedence over party policy,\" he said, urging members to evaluate budget matters through the lens of public interest. Turning to Balochistan, he expressed concern over the province's stalled development projects under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). He stressed that these delayed initiatives require urgent government attention and action to address the longstanding grievances of the people of Balochistan. Senator Haji Hidayatullah urged the federal government to reconsider the imposition of taxes on the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), describing the region as severely underdeveloped and lacking basic infrastructure. He appealed to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to abolish the existing tax, arguing that even the limited resources available to the area have been systematically denied over the years. Senator Haji Hidayatullah called for restoring the Rs. 100 billion allocation for FATA and urged investments in education and healthcare. \"Hospitals have been blown up, schools destroyed. The people need real relief, not just promises,\" he stated. Responding to concerns raised by Senator Haji Hidayatullah, Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar assured the House that the government values the grievances of the people of the merged tribal districts and takes them seriously. Addressing the senator directly, he requested him to end his protest, affirming that his reservations had already been communicated to the relevant federal authorities. Tarar emphasized that every citizen, including those from the former FATA and PATA regions, holds equal importance in the eyes of the state. \"Haji Sahib is not only our colleague but also a brother. His demands reflect genuine concerns, and it is the government's responsibility to ensure relief reaches every corner of the country,\" he said. Clarifying the taxation policy, the law minister explained that the initial tax exemptions granted to the merged districts were extended beyond the original timeframe. He noted that the exemption from income tax remains intact, with only relocated industries now subject to certain levies. In response to Senator Kamran Murtaza's remarks on Balochistan's underdevelopment, Tarar reiterated the government's commitment to addressing Balochistan's issues. He said the most pressing issue in the province-lack of communication infrastructure-was being actively tackled. \"The cabinet has approved and fully allocated funding for the Quetta-Chaman and Quetta-Karachi highways,\" he stated, describing it as a major step forward. On the education front, the minister highlighted the Prime Minister's focus on uplifting underserved regions. He noted that while no new Danish schools were opened in Punjab under the current government, five such schools-each costing around Rs. 3 billion-were being established in Balochistan. \"This reflects the Prime Minister's and the government's sincere dedication to the people of Balochistan. You will not find this administration lagging in its resolve to address their needs,\" Tarar concluded.",
