    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 09 (APP): The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration released data on the third day of Eid, showing steady progress in the ongoing zero waste campaign. According to data, a total of 1,865 tonnes of animal waste had been collected and disposed of during the first two days of Eid. The district administration reported that waste from 111,190 sacrificial animals had been gathered across urban and rural areas. This included waste from 65,138 smaller animals such as goats and sheep, and 46,052 larger animals like cows and camels. On the second day alone, sanitation teams collected 502 tonnes of waste. According to the figures, this included waste from 17,695 small and 12,373 large animals. In this regard, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon said that all sacrificial sites were promptly washed with rose water and disinfectants to avoid any health risks or bad smell. He added that dedicated teams had been active across both the urban sectors and rural zones of the capital. The DC said that monitoring of the sanitation drive is being conducted through a third-party inspection system and drone surveillance. Additionally, the Safe City Control Room is also helping monitor the progress of the operation in real time. \"All officials have been in the field since the first day of Eid,\" said Irfan Memon, while assuring that the campaign will continue until every area is cleared of waste. He further noted that the goal of the operation is not only cleanliness but also to maintain the city's environment. \"Keeping Islamabad clean is a collective responsibility,\" he said. The administration has urged residents to avoid throwing animal waste in open areas. They have asked citizens to report unattended waste or sanitation complaints to the helpline, so teams can respond quickly. The zero waste drive is part of a broader Eid sanitation plan launched before the festival. Under the plan, the city was divided into different zones, with field teams and machinery deployed to collect animal waste without delay. Mobile units, garbage trucks, and loaders were seen moving across Islamabad, collecting waste from neighbourhoods and transporting it to designated landfill sites. The Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) jointly managed the cleanup efforts, backed by ICT administration. The administration has also launched an awareness campaign through social media and public announcements, asking people to cooperate and follow the city's waste disposal guidelines. Authorities said that despite the large number of animals sacrificed this year, the situation remained under control due to early preparations and quick response from teams on the ground. The DC said that citizens' cooperation made a major difference in managing the high volume of waste and maintaining order in public spaces. As the third day of Eid comes to a close, the operation is set to continue until all reported waste has been collected. The administration has promised to keep sanitation teams active until every complaint is resolved and all locations are cleared. The Eid zero waste drive reflects the city's growing focus on public hygiene and responsible management of festive activities.",
