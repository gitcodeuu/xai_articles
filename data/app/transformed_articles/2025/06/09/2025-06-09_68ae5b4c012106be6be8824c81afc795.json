    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 09 (APP): Renowned corporate strategist Imran Ghaznavi has released a landmark book, Reputation Management and Crisis Communication: A Study of Corporate Sector, offering a vital guide for business leaders navigating reputational challenges in an increasingly complex corporate world. Now available internationally, the book presents a comprehensive roadmap for managing corporate reputation-an intangible asset the World Economic Forum estimates contributes up to 65% of a company's market value. With over 30 years of experience advising multinational firms through major disruptions like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, Ghaznavi emphasises that \"reputation is not just an image; it's hard-earned capital that can disappear within minutes.\" The publication introduces a structured, three-phase model for crisis management, focusing on pre-crisis planning, real-time response, and post-crisis recovery. It also argues for embedding reputation risk into corporate governance, suggesting that 30% of executive compensation be tied to reputation performance. Key features of the book include in-depth analysis of high-profile corporate crises, such as the Volkswagen emissions scandal and Apple's supply chain issues, strategies for managing online backlash, disinformation, and the rising challenge of deepfakes and ready-to-use templates for crisis communication, media engagement, and reputation audits. The book, which is targeted at CEOs, board members, public relations experts, risk professionals, students, and policymakers, is being lauded as a must-read for modern leadership. Industry analysts say Ghaznavi's work bridges a critical gap in business literature by blending academic research with real-world applications, setting a new benchmark for corporate crisis leadership in the digital era.",
