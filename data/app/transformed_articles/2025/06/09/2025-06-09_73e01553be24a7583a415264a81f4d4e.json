    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 9 (APP):As part of its commitment to women's empowerment, the Prime Minister's Women Empowerment Package 2024 has rolled out numerous initiatives nationwide. As per Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 presented by Federal Minister for Finance Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday, the comprehensive initiative focused on economic inclusion, financial independence, skill development, and leadership opportunities for women. The implementation of these directives was being closely monitored to ensure tangible outcomes that benefit women across Pakistan, particularly those from marginalized and vulnerable communities. Prime Minister's Initiative for Women Empowerment provides women with interest free loans, skills training, and daycare centers for working women. The Women Pink Bus Service and the Women on Wheels Project have been launched to improve women's mobility and safety, particularly in urban areas. Similarly, the Punjab Pink Scooty Scheme offered interest-free loans for female students to buy scooters, while the Women Parliamentary Caucus works to enhance women's political participation. Provincially, programs like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's gender-sensitive labor inspection teams and Balochistan's Gender Desk promotes gender equality in employment and labor rights. Through the implementation of policies like Banking on Equality and the Revolving Financing Facility for Women Entrepreneurs, which target the financial inclusion of women, and the National Financial inclusion Strategy (2023), which surpassed its target of 20 million active bank accounts for women, Pakistan is breaking down barriers to women's financial independence.",
