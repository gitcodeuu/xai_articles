    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 09 (APP): Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (R) Syed Zeeshan Haider remained present on the city's major thoroughfares and recreational points on the third day of Eid to review the traffic situation and ensure smooth vehicular movement. An official told APP on Monday that over 300 Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) personnel were actively engaged in maintaining traffic flow across the city during the Eid holidays as part of a comprehensive strategy. CTO Zeeshan issued further directives to improve the flow of traffic and appreciated the dedication of traffic personnel performing duties away from their families. CTO Zeeshan said that strict action was being taken against violators of traffic rules, including one-wheelers, rowdy bikers, and those riding motorcycles without silencers. CTO Zeeshan said several motorcycles and vehicles had been impounded for serious violations, while a zero-tolerance policy was being implemented against illegal parking and disruptive behaviour on roads. The CTO said no untoward incident had occurred due to effective planning and consistent efforts by traffic officers. CTO Zeeshan said traffic remained smooth across the city despite the heavy Eid rush, with officers effectively managing congestion and controlling crowds at popular recreational locations. CTO Zeeshan advised citizens visiting parks and entertainment venues to avoid parking on main roads and instead use designated parking spaces. The CTO urged citizens to cooperate with traffic officers and report any complaints to the Islamabad Traffic Police Helpline 1915.",
