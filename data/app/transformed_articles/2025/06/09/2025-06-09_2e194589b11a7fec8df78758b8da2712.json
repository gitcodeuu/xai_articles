    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 09 (APP):The federal government is taking major steps to combat climate change by launching a comprehensive Urban Resilience Policy Framework, establishing a \"Green Corridor\" under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and progressing on its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to secure climate finance and reduce disaster risks. According to Economic Survey 2024-25 report issued here Monday, the federal government has drafted a new Urban Resilience Policy Framework to guide climate-resilient urban development across Pakistan. The policy aims to strengthen cities against climate threats through sustainable infrastructure, mitigation strategies and adaptation measures tailored to local needs. Once approved by provincial governments, the framework will be presented to the federal Cabinet for final endorsement. Key goals include enhancing disaster preparedness, promoting green urban growth, and supporting local institutions in implementing resilience action plans. Under the CPEC Phase II, the country is developing a Green Corridor to integrate eco-friendly practices in transport, energy, agriculture, and industry. Led by the Ministry of Climate Change, the initiative aligns with Pakistan's climate goals and China's green development priorities. The corridor will focus on low-carbon transport to cut emissions, reforestation and biodiversity conservation, climate-smart agriculture for food security, and clean energy projects to meet climate commitments and create green jobs. Similarly, the government is accelerating its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). In 2024, the government prepared 10 concept notes for priority sectors, with five more in development for global funding. A recent costing study estimates Pakistan needs $3.9-17.8 billion to implement 117 adaptation measures against floods, droughts, and heatwaves. Capacity-building workshops have trained officials in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh on climate finance and adaptation planning. Provincial gap analyses are also underway to streamline resilience efforts. With rising climate threats, these initiatives aim to safeguard Pakistan's economy, infrastructure, and communities while ensuring sustainable development. The policies underscore Pakistan's commitment to global climate frameworks and green growth.",
