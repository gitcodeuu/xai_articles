    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday postponed the hearing of appeals filed by convicts in the May 9 Ramna Police Station attack case after it ran out of time during proceedings. A division bench of the Islamabad High Court, comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, was scheduled to hear appeals filed by Sohail Khan and others convicted in the case involving an attack and arson at the Ramna Police Station on May 9. However, the hearing was postponed without any proceedings due to a shortage of time. During the hearing, lawyers Babar Awan, Sardar Masroof, Murtaza Toori, and others appeared on behalf of the petitioners. As the court was already occupied with other cases, it could not proceed with the appeals. Recognizing the delay, Justice Soomro informed Advocate Babar Awan that a new hearing date would be given soon. He proposed that the matter be taken up on Monday, June 30. \"We will hear your case then,\" the judge stated. Following this, the court formally adjourned the hearing until June 30 without taking up the matter. The case relates to the violent protests that took place following the arrest of a political leader last year. Protesters allegedly stormed the Ramna Police Station, causing damage to public property. Several individuals, including Sohail Khan, were later convicted for their involvement in the incident. They are now seeking suspension of their sentences and challenging their convictions through appeals before the Islamabad High Court.",
