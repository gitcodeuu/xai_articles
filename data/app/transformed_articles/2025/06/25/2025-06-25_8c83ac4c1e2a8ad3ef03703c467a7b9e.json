    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): The University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (UAJK) on Wednesday successfully organized a thought-provoking seminar and a two-day \"Training of Trainers\" workshop aimed at addressing national challenges, promoting social harmony and fostering the positive development of youth. The events, held at UAJK's Chehla Campus, witnessed enthusiastic participation from faculty members, students, and representatives of civil society, said a press release. These significant activities were organized under the auspices of the Paigham-e-Pakistan Centre for Peace and Reconciliation Studies, Islamic Research Institute, International Islamic University Islamabad, in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), European Union, and the Prime Minister's Youth Programme. The three-day series concluded with a seminar where renowned academics and policymakers held in-depth discussions on the challenges facing young people, the causes of social polarization, and practical solutions for building a more tolerant and united society. Addressing the seminar, Vice Chancellor of UAJK, Professor Dr. Nadeem Haider Bukhari, congratulated the organizers and participants on the successful conduct of the workshop and seminar. He emphasized that youth are the true asset of any nation, and their intellectual and moral development is of utmost importance. \"Our responsibility is not merely to educate our youth but to shape them into individuals of strong character, self-respect, and custodians of national unity,\" he stated. Dr. Bukhari urged young people to focus on personal development and self-awareness, as the journey to real progress begins within. Highlighting the value of freedom, he remarked, \"This country and our independence are divine blessings that we must cherish. Just ask the people of occupied Kashmir and Gaza, still struggling for the most basic right, freedom.\" He stressed that sectarianism, hatred, and divisive politics must be rejected in favor of national unity and peace, which are essential for a strong and prosperous Pakistan. Speaking on the occasion, Professor Dr. Zia-ul-Haq, Director General of the Islamic Research Institute, International Islamic University Islamabad, praised the patriotism and commitment of UAJK's students and faculty towards the nation. He announced that a major Youth Summit will be held in Muzaffarabad next month to promote intellectual awakening, national solidarity, and the spirit of nation-building among young people. Dr. Zia-ul-Haq further remarked that despite the domestic and global challenges Pakistan faces today, these obstacles can be transformed into opportunities through honesty, perseverance, and by harnessing the creative potential of the youth. \"Since May 10, Pakistan has entered a new phase of possibilities. It is now imperative that we equip our young generation with modern education, practical skills, and the confidence to lead the country towards progress and prosperity,\" he added. Registrar of UAJK, Professor Dr. Saadat Hanif Dar, also addressed the seminar and emphasized that over 60 percent of Pakistan's population comprises youth. \"This demographic advantage can only translate into national progress if young people focus on education, emotional intelligence, technical skills, leadership qualities, and mental well-being,\" he asserted. Deputy Director of the Islamic Research Institute, Dr. Rustam, and Director of UAJK's Jhelum Valley Campus, Dr. Imtiaz Awan, also spoke at the seminar. They termed the workshop and seminar a positive initiative that will help promote tolerance, constructive thinking, and national unity in the region. Students actively engaged in the sessions, expressing their views and raising pertinent questions, while the guest speakers provided practical suggestions to guide the youth towards playing a productive role in society. The event concluded with a joint declaration by participants, reaffirming their commitment to continue working for the intellectual, moral, and professional development of young people and to play their role in steering Pakistan towards a future marked by peace, unity, and progress.",
