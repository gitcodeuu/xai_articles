    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): Chairman of the Senate, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, reiterated his unwavering commitment to constitutional supremacy, institutional harmony, and democratic accountability on Wednesday. He declared Parliament the \"ultimate symbol of the people's power\" and a vital pillar of Pakistan's governance system. While addressing a luncheon arranged in honour of the members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association (PRA), he said that under his leadership, the Senate would function strictly within constitutional boundaries, promoting transparency, inclusivity, and institutional respect. \"We will follow Pakistan's Constitution. There will be no institutional clash,\" he asserted. He said, \"We live in the age of media, which has evolved rapidly by adopting modern tools and technologies.\" The media have always played a pivotal role in safeguarding the public's information rights. He praised journalists for their dedication, integrity, and fact-based reporting, which keeps the public informed and holds the system accountable. A transparent Parliament and a free press, he said, are the true essence of democracy. Highlighting the crucial role of media, Gilani said \"Your pen acts as a bridge between the people and those in power. The media's responsibility in promoting national cohesion and strengthening institutions by highlighting the truth is more significant than ever. In today's environment, the need for responsible journalism has increased manifold. Fake news and misinformation spread through digital platforms undermine public trust.\" Recalling his academic and professional roots, Gilani highlighted his master's degree in journalism and expressed deep appreciation for the media's role in a democratic society. \"I understand and value the importance of free and responsible journalism Sharing his journey, he remarked that during his tenure as Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, and now as Chairman Senate, he had always taken practical steps to promote journalism and address the concerns of media professionals. \"I have a background in journalism myself, and my family has served the political landscape for over 450 years,\" he added. He also recalled being unanimously elected as Chairman of the Upper House of Parliament. Paying tribute to the founding leadership of his political party, he said, \"Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto gifted the nation the 1973 Constitution, and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto restored its original form through the Charter of Democracy-a remarkable and difficult achievement that was made possible through the strength of Parliament and the people.\" Gilani underlined the Senate's role in legislating for the protection of journalists' rights and expressed hope that parliamentary reporters will continue to provide the public with accurate, fact-based information. Underscoring his focus on institutional empowerment, Gilani said that recent top-level promotions within the Senate Secretariat were made on merit. \"I promoted deserving officers from within the institution to ensure continuity and uphold the integrity of the Secretariat,\" he said, rejecting favouritism or external interference. He assured full support in resolving the issues faced by parliamentary journalists. \"I take pride in being the founder of the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers Conference, which remains a significant milestone for Pakistan and me personally,\" he added. He also paid tribute to his mentors in journalism, stating that their efforts had greatly contributed to his success. Sharing insights from his tenure as Prime Minister, Gilani underscored his consistent presence during Question Hour in the National Assembly. \"I never missed these sessions because they were essential for ensuring ministerial accountability and improving governance,\" he noted. \"It also provided accurate material for media reporting.\" He emphasised that leadership must be rooted in public service rather than personal ambition. \"The people re-elect those who serve them sincerely. My family's continued presence in Parliament reflects the public's trust,\" he said, referencing his sons' roles as public representatives and his election as Chairman Senate. Gilani recalled the historic Charter of Democracy, signed by Benazir Bhutto and Mian Nawaz Sharif, calling it a cornerstone in restoring the true spirit of Pakistan's Constitution. He also highlighted his efforts to promote parliamentary diplomacy, including his unanimous election as the founding Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers' Conference, attended by delegates from 45 countries. Chairman Gilani assured PRA leadership that the issues highlighted would be resolved and called for a new era built on truth, professionalism, and principled journalism. \"Let us move forward together on this democratic journey, striving to build an informed, empowered, and united nation,\" he said. He concluded by paying heartfelt tribute to the contributions of journalists and reaffirmed the crucial role of media in national progress and public empowerment. The luncheon was attended by Deputy Chairman Senate Syedaal Khan, Senate Secretary Syed Hasnain Haider, and a large number of PRA members.",
