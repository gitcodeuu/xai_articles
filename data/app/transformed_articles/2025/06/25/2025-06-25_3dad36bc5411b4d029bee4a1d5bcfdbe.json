    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): Ambassador of Palestine to Pakistan, Dr. Zaher Zaid Wednesday called on Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq at the Parliament House. Ayaz Sadiq has strongly condemned the grave human rights violations occurring in Gaza. He described the ongoing Israeli aggression as a major humanitarian catastrophe. The loss of over 50,000 lives due to Israeli attacks is a heart-wrenching tragedy for every Pakistani, he stated. The Speaker emphasized that the continuous killing of innocent children in Gaza is a critical test for the conscience of the global community. He also expressed deep concern over Israel's obstruction of humanitarian aid to Gaza, stating that using food as a weapon is utterly unacceptable. Ayaz Sadiq reaffirmed Pakistan's unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, asserting that the country would continue to stand by its Palestinian brothers on moral and diplomatic fronts at every level. He also denounced Israel's attack on Iran, calling it a blatant violation of international law and a serious threat to regional and global peace. Welcoming the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the Speaker said that the world today needs peace, not war. Ayaz Sadiq said that Pakistan has always given a firm and effective response to Indian aggression. He said that during the recent escalation, the alliance between India and Israel has become visibly evident. He categorically stated that Pakistan does not recognize Israel as a state but regards it as a terrorist organization. Ambassador Dr. Zaher Zaid expressed deep gratitude for Pakistan's consistent and principled support for the Palestinian cause. He said that the oppressed people of Gaza highly value the solidarity and sympathy shown by the people of Pakistan. \"We are proud to have Pakistan standing with us,\" said Ambassador Zaid, adding that he hopes Pakistan will continue to raise its voice for Palestine at international forums. He further stressed that Palestine urgently needs humanitarian aid, diplomatic backing, and international pressure to stop the ongoing Israeli atrocities.",
