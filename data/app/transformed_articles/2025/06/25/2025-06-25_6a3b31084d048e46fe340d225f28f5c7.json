    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): The world today observes the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, marking 41 years since the adoption of the UN Convention against Torture. Governments, civil society and international organizations have come together to reaffirm their commitment to eradicating torture and to honour the strength and resilience of survivors. \"The international prohibition of torture is absolute and non-negotiable. No circumstances, including war or public emergency, can justify its use,\" said Vladimir Jovic, Chair of the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. At the United Nations Headquarters in New York and Geneva, a series of high-level events are taking place, including a panel discussion featuring independent human rights experts, an art competition, and a guided exhibition titled \"Torture Must End Now.\" The United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT), along with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, has called on all states to strengthen their national legal frameworks, ensure accountability, and provide full rehabilitation and justice to survivors. As part of the commemoration, campaigners emphasized the critical role of legal professionals in preventing torture and excluding evidence obtained under duress. The exclusionary rule, a key protection under international law, continues to be undermined in practice in many regions. The UN also launched updated campaign materials urging citizens and policymakers to join the call using hashtags like #26June, #AgainstTorture and #TortureVictims Day. While 162 countries have ratified the Convention against Torture, UN bodies continue to urge universal ratification and full enforcement. Survivors, advocates, and rights defenders stress that \"justice delayed is justice denied,\" and reiterate their demand for a world free from torture.",
