    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Wednesday urged residents and authorities in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K), Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad to remain vigilant and take precautionary measures over the next 24 hours as heavy rain and thunderstorms may disrupt daily life and endanger infrastructure. The National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) of NDMA has issued a consolidated impact-based weather alert for multiple regions across the country, forecasting rainfall, thunderstorms, and gusty winds over the next 12 to 24 hours, with intermittent pauses in activity. In AJ&K, areas such as Bagh, Rawalakot, Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Haveli, Hattian Bala, and Mirpur are expected to receive moderate to heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms. Similarly, most parts of Sindh, including Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Khairpur, Karachi, Hyderabad, Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Thatta, and Badin, are likely to experience similar weather patterns during this period. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rainfall and thunderstorms are anticipated in districts including Chitral, Dir, Swat, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Haripur, Karak, Kohat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Bannu, Buner, Hazara, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, and Waziristan. Meanwhile, in Islamabad and areas of Punjab such as Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Hafizabad, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Lahore, Kasur, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rahim Yar Khan, and Dera Ghazi Khan are also under alert for similar conditions. The NDMA has advised vigilance as these weather patterns could cause weak trees to be uprooted, disrupt power supply, and damage fragile infrastructure, rooftops, and electrical poles. Dust storms and strong winds could further reduce visibility, especially during rain events, heightening the risk of traffic accidents and road hazards. Citizens are strongly advised to avoid standing near trees, billboards, and unsecured structures that may collapse during windstorms. Emergency services should ensure readiness for any potential response operations. For real-time alerts and guidance, download the \"Pak NDMA Disaster Alert\" mobile application.",
