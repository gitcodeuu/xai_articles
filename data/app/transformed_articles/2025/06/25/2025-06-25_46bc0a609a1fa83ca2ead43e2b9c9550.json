    "article_body": "LAHORE, Jun 25 (APP): Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Yahya Afridi, accompanied by Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, visited the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), here on Wednesday. The chief justice thanked the bar for receiving him and acknowledged the critical role, the legal community plays in effective administration of justice. He announced carrying out the feasibility of a Facilitation Centre at the Supreme Court Branch Registry, Lahore. Designed to provide one-window operations for litigants and legal practitioners, the Centre would reflect the Supreme Court's commitment to a citizen-centric, digitally integrated and cost-efficient justice system. The CJP urged lawyers to adopt the digital filing systems, so as to enhance the efficiency and timeliness of judicial processes. He underscored the indispensable role of the bar in upholding the rule of law, reaffirming the Bench's deeper respect for the legal profession and its foundational role in the justice system. The chief justice also announced that, under the auspices of the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, a new initiative has been launched to provide legal representation, at state expense, to financially distressed litigants at all levels of the judiciary, from magistrate courts to the Supreme Court. This measure, it was reiterated, aims to ensure equitable access to justice for all citizens. Salman Mansoor, Secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association, expressed appreciation for the Chief Justice's visit and commended his leadership in addressing the concerns of the Bar. He welcomed the establishment of the Facilitation Centre and reaffirmed the Bar's unwavering support for collaborative judicial reforms. Earlier in the day, the Chief Justice chaired a high-level meeting at the Supreme Court Branch Registry, Lahore, to review progress on the Court's automation and digital transformation initiatives. Emphasizing the need for technology integration across all procedural levels, he highlighted the importance of creating a justice system that is efficient, transparent and responsive to public needs. Representatives from the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) briefed the Chief Justice on the successful digital initiatives undertaken by the Lahore High Court, offering insights into scalable models for implementation across the superior judiciary. On arrival, the delegation was greeted by Mr. Salman Mansoor, Secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association, along with other esteemed members of the legal fraternity.",
