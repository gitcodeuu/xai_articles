    "article_body": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN , Jun 25 (APP):The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Food Safety and Halal Food Authority (KP FS&HFA) conducted a series of inspection operations across various towns of Dera Ismail Khan district, including Paharpur, Muriali, and Pusha Pul. The purpose of these operations was to assess hygiene standards and ensure food safety compliance. During the drive, food safety teams visited a number of local businesses, including general stores, bakeries, hotels, and grocery shops. The inspections were aimed at identifying violations of hygiene protocols, food quality standards, and storage practices. According to a official of KP FS&HFA, \"These routine inspections are part of our broader initiative to safeguard public health and ensure that consumers have access to hygienic and safe food. In locations where shortcomings were found, improvement notices have been issued to vendors and owners with a clear timeline for compliance.\" The official emphasized that non-compliance with food safety standards would not be tolerated and that continued violations could result in legal action, fines, or even closure of the premises. KP FS&HFA reiterated its commitment to conducting regular field inspections across the district and urged the public to report unhygienic practices through official helplines and complaint portals.",
