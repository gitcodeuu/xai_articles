    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): Chairperson Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid Wednesday termed the Benazir Hunarmand Programme (BHP) a landmark initiative to economically empower BISP beneficiaries through skill training and employment. She said the programme, launched by President Asif Ali Zardari on June 21 to mark the birth anniversary of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, reflects the vision of inclusive and sustainable development. She made these remarks while chairing a key meeting with the World Bank team at BISP Headquarters to explore enhanced collaboration on data sharing with provincial social protection institutions, aimed at improving service delivery for vulnerable populations across the country. Ms. Melis Guven, Lead Economist and Global Lead for Social Protection Delivery Systems at the World Bank, joined the meeting virtually, while senior World Bank officials Dr. Amjad Zafar Khan and Mr. Gul Najam Jamy participated in person. During the meeting, Rubina Khalid emphasized the importance of addressing the risks and challenges associated with data sharing, particularly those related to privacy, data protection, and the implementation of strong security protocols. She reiterated that BISP's National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER), like NADRA, must remain a centralized and secure database to maintain authenticity and ensure the protection of beneficiary information. The meeting concluded with a proposal to organize a national-level workshop in Islamabad on the subject of data sharing to raise awareness among all stakeholders about the sensitivity and significance of secure data practices. It was also proposed that representatives from planning and development departments, social sector programs, and senior officials from across the provinces be taken on board, and a series of workshops be conducted to build consensus and strengthen secure, efficient data-sharing mechanisms within Pakistan's social protection framework.",
