The aim is to promote data-based decision-making and to institutionalize strategic foresight, data-driven governance and public policy innovation, said a press release. The understanding reflects a shared commitment to modernize Pakistan's institutional response to global challenges by leveraging emerging technologies, fostering narrative diplomacy, and enhancing national competitiveness. President of COPAIR, Amna Munawwar Awan, remarked, \"Pakistan's future depends on its ability to convert intelligence into influence.

At COPAIR, we see this as the beginning of a new era of collaborative governance.\" CEO of Mishal Pakistan Amir Jahangir, said, \"The World Economic Forum's global indices are not merely scorecards, they are strategic mirrors\". Through this partnership with COPAIR, we aim to provide Pakistan the tools to see itself clearly, act courageously, and compete effectively in the global arena.\" Key areas of collaboration will be foresight reports on governance, and institutional reform, trainings for parliamentarians, media professionals, and youth on public policy and strategic communication, launching fellowships, strategic essay competitions and curriculum partnerships with universities.
