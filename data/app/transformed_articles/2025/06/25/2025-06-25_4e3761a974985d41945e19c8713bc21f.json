    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, on Wednesday said that Pakistan's global standings strengthened to its effective diplomatic engagements and consistent peace efforts. Speaking to a private news channel, he said that Pakistan has earned great respect in the region by pursuing a successful diplomatic strategy and enhancing its foreign policy image. \"Our diplomatic achievements have elevated Pakistan's stature on the international stage and the world has acknowledged our efforts for peace,\" he stated. Answering a question, he said the myth of Israel's invincibility has been shattered by Iran, adding that Tel Aviv is now facing humiliation, economic collapse, infrastructure devastation, and the erosion of its diplomatic influence. He further stated that like its strategic partner India, Israel is slipping into isolation, while Pakistan has continued to strengthen its relations with brotherly countries, particularly Iran.",
