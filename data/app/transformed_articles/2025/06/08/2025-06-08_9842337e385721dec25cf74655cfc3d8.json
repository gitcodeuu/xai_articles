    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 08 (APP): The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration has released a detailed performance report following the first day of its zero-waste operation carried out during Eid-ul-Azha. According to the report, a total of 81,122 animal remains - weighing around 1,362 tonnes - were collected and disposed of from across the city in just one day. The large-scale cleaning drive was part of a planned strategy to manage the waste generated during Eid, particularly from animal sacrifices. The campaign entered its second day with the same level of activity and coordination, focusing on waste removal at 107 designated dumping points across Islamabad. Chief Commissioner Islamabad and Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon remained in the field throughout the day, personally inspecting operations and ensuring that all teams stayed on track. Meanwhile, all assistant commissioners, including the Additional Deputy Commissioner (General), were also deployed at various locations to oversee the efforts. Officials said that this year, for the first time in Pakistan, drone cameras were used to supervise the waste collection and disposal process. The use of drone technology helped in identifying unattended spots and coordinating rapid clean-up responses. At the sites where animals were sacrificed, the administration followed up the cleanup with disinfection. Rosewater and phenyl were sprayed, followed by lime powder to minimise foul odours and prevent the spread of germs. Meanwhile, a central control room remained active to address complaints from the public. Authorities confirmed that all complaints received on the first day were acted upon and resolved without delay. Deputy Commissioner Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon, urged citizens to continue cooperating with the administration during the Eid days. He appealed to residents to prefer designated collective sacrifice areas instead of carrying out slaughter in open spaces. \"If you see animal waste dumped in any undesignated area, inform us immediately,\" he added. The deputy commissioner also encouraged people to join hands with the city administration to maintain cleanliness during the Eid days. \"Together we can keep Islamabad clean and organised,\" he said. In the days leading up to Eid, city authorities had prepared detailed action plans, setting up temporary dumping sites and deploying staff and vehicles to cover urban and rural sectors of the capital. Special attention was given to ensure that the waste was collected without delay, especially from densely populated residential areas. Sanitation workers were assigned in shifts, and vehicles including loaders, dumpers, and compactors were mobilised. According to officials, public cooperation played a key role in the success of the operation on the first day. Public announcements, social media posts, and awareness messages were used to inform residents about waste disposal points and helpline numbers. Waste bags were also distributed in many areas ahead of Eid to make the process smoother. The campaign will continue until all remains from sacrificial animals have been cleared from the city. Officials said they would maintain the same pace and coordination through the remaining days of Eid to avoid any delays or hygiene concerns. Islamabad's zero-waste Eid operation is being viewed as a model that can be adopted by other cities in future. The administration plans to assess its performance further and make improvements for upcoming years. As the cleanup enters its second phase, authorities are calling on the public to stay vigilant and continue reporting any unattended waste.",
