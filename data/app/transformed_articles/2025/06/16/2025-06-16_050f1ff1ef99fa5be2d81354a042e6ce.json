    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 16 (APP):Lotus Lake, popularly known as Kanwal Jheel, located in the tranquil hills of Shakarparian in federal capital, offered scenic beauty but still unknown for many visitors. Inaugurated in late 2020 as part of a \"natural family park\" project, the site features a 100-foot-long lotus pond, surrounded by wooden seating areas and a place designated for barbecue. The surroundings has been covered with lattices for security purpose, also aiming to preserve the natural beauty of the area. Despite its scenic appeal, the lake remains largely unnoticed and receives few public attention. A visitor, Haris Eman told, \"We are always concerned about safety while deciding a spot to visit with family, this place is ideal and silence with beautiful views around.\" It is the perfect place to views with family, he added.",
