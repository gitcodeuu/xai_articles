    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 16 (APP):Parliamentary Secretary Information and Broadcasting Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry has said that Israel, whose is pursuing a policy of \"might is right\" that is unacceptable to anyone. The international community should take steps to stop Israeli aggression that can destabilize the region. Talking to the media outside the Parliament House on Monday, he said that Israel's aggressive actions against Iran will destabilize the region, and the international community should stop Israel's policy of aggression against other countries, and this process should stop now because this policy is unacceptable to anyone. Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry said that despite the strict conditions imposed by the IMF, the government is trying to provide relief to the people. Positive suggestions from allies and the opposition will also be welcomed. He said that Pakistan is moving towards development, the country's economic indicators are indicating growth. The targets set in the current fiscal year budget have been met. No new taxes have been imposed in the new budget, maximum relief has been given. Hopefully, this will be the last budget under the strict conditions of the IMF and more better budgets will be given in the future. In response to a question, he said that no budget is perfect, every budget has room for improvement, and we will try to remove the concerns raised by the allies and the opposition regarding the budget.",
