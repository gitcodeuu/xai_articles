    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 30 (APP): Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Monday said that Pakistan's stance was recognized and upheld during the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, where India was unable to assert its position. Speaking to a private news channel, the minister said that Pakistan's position was based on facts and justice, which is why it was acknowledged at the SCO platform, despite Indian efforts. He strongly criticized India for what he called \"water terrorism\", accusing New Delhi of attempting to hold 240 million Pakistanis hostage by manipulating shared water resources. \"No party has the right to unilaterally suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, which remains binding under international law,\" he emphasized. Answering a question, he said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political future is in decline, especially after India's failure on military and diplomatic fronts. He further said that Modi was trying to salvage political respect through fabricated narratives. \"After repeated setbacks, Modi's era of misleading the public is coming to an end,\" he stated.",
