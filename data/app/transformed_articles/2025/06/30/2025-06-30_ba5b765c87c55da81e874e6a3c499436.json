    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 30 (APP):In a tribute to one of Pakistan's greatest cultural icons, the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), through its Visual Arts Division, hosted an exclusive art exhibition to commemorate the 95th birth anniversary of the legendary artist Sadequain. Organized in collaboration with the Sadequain Foundation USA, the event highlighted the extraordinary legacy of a visionary who redefined the country's artistic landscape. Held at the PNCA's National Art Gallery, the exhibition showcased more than 100 rare and iconic artworks from the Council's permanent collection-each piece a gift from Sadequain himself. From captivating murals and bold paintings to intricate marble sculptures, the collection reflected the breadth of the artist's genius and offered a glimpse into the mind of a man whose work continues to inspire generations. Born on June 30, 1930, Sadequain rose to fame in the 1950s with a distinctive style rooted in calligraphy, symbolism, and social commentary. His dramatic lines, vibrant colors, and profound themes resonated across social classes, establishing him not just as an artist but as a voice of the people. His ability to blend poetry and visual art earned him global admiration and a lasting place in Pakistan's cultural narrative. The event featured an artist talk bringing together prominent scholars, artists, and admirers of Sadequain's work. Dr. Salman Ahmed, author of The Saga of Sadequain and founder of the Sadequain Foundation USA, addressed the audience via video message. He praised PNCA for preserving the artist's legacy and acknowledged the collaborative efforts of Director General PNCA Ayoub Jamali, Director Visual Arts Division Mariam Ahmed, and Foundation Representative Zohaib Chaudhary. Ambassador Ali Sarwar Naqvi, Executive Director of the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS), shared heartfelt memories of his personal interactions with Sadequain, offering rare insights into the artist's intellectual depth. Major General (Retd.) Dr. Farrukh Seir, artist and founder of Gallery 21 Islamabad, recalled moments spent with the maestro, describing him as a creative force who lived and breathed art. Other speakers included Zarar Haider Babry, a prominent artist and lecturer at the Islamic International University Islamabad, who highlighted Sadequain's influence on younger generations and encouraged scholarly exploration of his full body of work. Dr. Tayyeba Aziz, former professor at the University of Peshawar, delivered a compelling visual analysis comparing Sadequain's style with that of Picasso-particularly focusing on their use of line, form, and symbolism. The ceremony concluded with a guided tour of Gallery Sadequain, where students, art lovers, and emerging artists had the opportunity to engage directly with the masterpieces on display. Located in Gallery No. 4 of the National Art Gallery, this permanent collection continues to serve as a living tribute to the artist's brilliance and enduring relevance. Through this commemorative exhibition, PNCA reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding Pakistan's rich artistic heritage while fostering global partnerships, such as its ongoing collaboration with the Sadequain Foundation USA, to ensure the preservation and celebration of national icons.",
