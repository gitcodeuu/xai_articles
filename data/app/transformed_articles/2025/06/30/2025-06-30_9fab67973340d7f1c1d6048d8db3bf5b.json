    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 30 (APP):The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) celebrated its 52nd anniversary on Monday, marking over five decades of contributions to policy research and strategic thought. The event was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar as chief guest, alongside Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch, diplomats, academics, think-tank representatives, and media professionals, said a press release. The ceremony served as both a commemoration of ISSI's legacy since its establishment in 1973 and a reaffirmation of its continued commitment to support national policymaking through informed research and analysis. In his keynote address, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar outlined Pakistan's foreign policy amid shifting global dynamics, stressing the importance of proactive diplomacy in navigating international challenges. He addressed a broad range of foreign policy priorities in the context of emerging global and regional trends. Director General ISSI Ambassador Sohail Mahmood, in his opening remarks, thanked the Deputy Prime Minister for attending and acknowledged the collective efforts of Pakistan's political and military leadership, diplomats, civil society, media, and youth in defending national interests, particularly in response to recent tensions with India. He noted that Pakistan's principled and fact-based narrative had prevailed on the global stage, reaffirming the country's rising geostrategic salience. Ambassador Mahmood underscored the importance of sustained vigilance in the face of potential regional threats, while also advocating for continued efforts toward political stability, internal security, and economic progress. He called for adaptive and forward-looking diplomacy to address evolving challenges and seize new opportunities for Pakistan. Highlighting the evolving role of think tanks, he emphasized ISSI's growing contribution in supporting policy formulation. Over the past year, the Institute held more than 165 events, published over 180 issue briefs, and hosted international dialogues on themes ranging from the global order and major power dynamics to CPEC, climate change, critical emerging technologies, and the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. With nearly 100 institutional partnerships and active engagement with youth and global counterparts, he stressed that the ISSI has strengthened its research-policy bridge role and deepened national and international outreach. He announced the release of five new books piloted by ISSI's Centres and reaffirmed the Institute's continued commitment to producing actionable insights, supporting Pakistan's foreign policy, and serving as a trusted platform for informed policy discourse. During the event, the ISSI presented its seven latest publications to the Deputy PM/Foreign Minister, including: Pakistan-China Relations: Connecting at the People's Level by the China-Pakistan Study Centre; The Kashmir Question in a Changing World: Beyond August 2019 by the India Study Centre; A New Era of Uncertainty: Emerging Technologies and Strategic Stability by the Arms Control & Disarmament Centre; Crossroads of Conflict: Transnational Terrorism from Afghanistan to Africa by the Centre for Afghanistan, Middle East & Africa; and Pakistan-Russia Relations: A Comprehensive Historical and Strategic Analysis by the Centre for Strategic Perspectives. Additionally, ISSI's biannual Journal Strategic Studies and Annual Report 2024 were presented. In the end, the Chairman BoG Ambassador Khalid Mahmood presented a special shield to the DPM/FM on the occasion. The commemorative event concluded with a cake-cutting ceremony.",
