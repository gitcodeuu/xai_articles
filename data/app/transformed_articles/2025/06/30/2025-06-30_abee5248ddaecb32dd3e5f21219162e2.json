    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 30 (APP):Ambassador of Iran to Pakistan, Dr. Raza Amiri Moghaddam, on Monday commended Pakistan's proactive and unwavering support for Iran during the recent escalation in the region. Speaking to a private news channel, the envoy said Pakistan played the most prominent role among all the brotherly nations, and the Iranian people deeply respect and value this support. He said, \"Pakistan's government, people, and media stood firmly with us. Pakistan extended full support at international forums including the UN Security Council and IAEA Board of Governors. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence of Pakistan offered complete cooperation.\" In contrast, India offered no support to Iran during the conflict, the ambassador said, suggesting that India remains under U.S. influence and maintains close ties with Israel. Dr. Amiri appreciated the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for its stronger-than-usual condemnation of the Israeli attacks, acknowledging improved performance compared to past. He also praised the roles of the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), stating that \"they all supported us.\" He clarified that Iran's response was defensive, as the aggression originated from Israel. The war started because of their provocations. Any future ceasefire depends on their actions. The losses they suffered may deter them from reigniting conflict soon, but if they feel they can win, they will not hesitate to start war again.\" Highlighting global diplomatic relations, the ambassador thanked China and Russia for backing Iran at the UN, alongside Pakistan, Algeria, and Turkiye. He emphasized the need for the Muslim world to unite, resist Western pressure, and take concrete steps for oppressed Muslims, especially in Gaza and Palestine. \"We ignore mere claims of victory,\" he concluded. \"What matters is how the people and the world perceive it. Both the U.S. President and Israeli Prime Minister have openly stated they want to overthrow Iran's government. This was a war of imposed aggression, not one we initiated.\"",
