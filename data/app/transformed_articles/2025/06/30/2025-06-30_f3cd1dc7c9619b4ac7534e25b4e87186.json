    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 30 (APP):In a magnificent affirmation of its rise in technology-oriented higher education, the National Skills University Islamabad (NSU) is celebrating a milestone that cements its position as a globally competitive institution that nurtures world-class talent. Ms. Eisha Zahra, a final-year student from the Department of Civil Engineering Technology, has achieved remarkable success. She is the first-ever NSU student to secure a fully funded international scholarship even before completing her undergraduate degree. Her accomplishment is a personal triumph and a source of pride and inspiration for the entire NSU community and the nation. Of importance, Eisha has been awarded the prestigious Chinese Government CSC Scholarship to pursue a Master's in Civil Engineering at the globally renowned Zhejiang University, currently ranked 49th in the QS World University Rankings 2025. Her selection is not just a personal triumph. It is a defining moment for a university that began its journey less than a decade ago. Founded on a vision of skills-driven transformation, NSU Islamabad is the only UNESCO-UNEVOC Centre in Pakistan, and it is already rewriting the narrative of higher education in South Asia. With a mission anchored in employability, innovation, and sustainability, this federal public university produces graduates who are not just job-ready but future-ready graduates. At the heart of this transformation is Prof. Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar, the Founding Vice Chancellor, who took the reins in October 2019 when the university was nothing more than a devastated and deteriorated infrastructure. In just a few years, Prof. Mukhtar and a dedicated faculty, led by the visionary Chairperson, Dr. Muhammad Habib, have converted a once-devastated infrastructure into a globally recognized, skills-focused university, attracting national and international accolades. From the induction of its first undergraduate batch in Fall 2021, NSU has proven its worth in the national and global education landscape. With the Class of 2025 preparing to graduate, several students have already secured employment with prestigious organizations across Pakistan, while others, like Eisha, are setting their sights on elite international academic programs. \"This is not just Eisha's success, it is Pakistan's success,\" said Prof. Dr. Mukhtar. \"We envisioned NSU as a place where education would directly translate into opportunity. Today, we are seeing that vision unfold.\" Under the dynamic mentorship of its faculty and Chairperson, Dr. Muhammad Habib, NSU's Department of Civil Engineering Technology has been training students to develop applied, industry-relevant skills. The selection of Eisha by Zhejiang University, known for its cutting-edge research and technological innovation, underscores NSU's programs' academic rigor and international relevance. Eisha's achievement is not just a personal success but a reflection of the growing global recognition of the potential embedded in Pakistan's new generation of skills-based institutions. As higher education pivots towards competency-based learning and real-world problem-solving, NSU Islamabad is positioning itself as a blueprint for the future. More than just an academic story, this is a narrative of hope and transformation, a symbol that Pakistan's youth, when empowered with the right tools and vision, can rise to global heights. With its first graduates making waves even before their formal convocation, NSU Islamabad is not just graduating students. It is launching leaders, innovators, and global citizens. As Ms. Zahra prepares to take her place on an international stage, she carries with her not only the aspirations of her peers but the promise of a university that dared to dream differently. NSU's journey begins from Islamabad to Hangzhou and many other impressive destinations in the coming days.",
