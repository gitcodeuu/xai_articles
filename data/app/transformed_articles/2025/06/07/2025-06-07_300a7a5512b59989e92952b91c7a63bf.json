    "article_body": "LAHORE, Jun 07 (APP): Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari extended heartfelt Eid al-Adha greetings to the nation, urging citizens to uphold the true values of sacrifice, compassion and unity associated with the sacred festival. In his special message issued here on Saturday on the occasion of Eid, Bilawal said, \"Eid al-Adha conveys a message of sacrifice, compassion and solidarity.\" He stressed that the festival is not just a ritual, but a reminder to work collectively towards building a peaceful and just society. He highlighted the importance of setting aside personal interests for the greater good, saying, \"Sacrificing personal interests for the collective good is the true spirit of Eid.\" Bilawal called upon the public to remember and support the underprivileged segments of society, particularly the poor, orphans, and those suffering due to poverty, climate-related disasters or conflict. He emphasized that the true celebration of Eid lies in sharing joy with those who are less fortunate. Reaffirming his party's commitment to social justice, the PPP Chairman stated, \"We are committed to building a welfare state in Pakistan based on equality,\" and stressed that no Pakistani should be left behind due to financial constraints. \"This is our mission,\"he added. Concluding his message, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said, \"May this Eid bring peace to hearts, unity to the nation and joy to your homes.\"",
