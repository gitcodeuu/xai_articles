In his special Eid message on Saturday, Anwar urged the nation to reflect on the true spirit of sacrifice by embracing compassion, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship. \"Eid-ul-Azha is not merely a religious ritual; it is a powerful reminder of the values that define a just and humane society,\" he stated. \"In these challenging times, our collective sacrifices must serve a greater purpose-uplifting the vulnerable, creating economic opportunities, and protecting the environment for future generations,\" he noted. He further added, \"Let this occasion strengthen our resolve to empower individuals with skills, support green entrepreneurship, and foster unity in diversity.\" FGP CEO expressed hope that the festive days would bring peace, joy, and a renewed sense of purpose to all. Muhammad Anwar concluded his message with a prayer: \"May our sacrifices be accepted, and may we become a nation known not only for its faith, but also for its fairness, generosity, and care for creation.\" He extended warm Eid greetings, saying, \"Eid Mubarak to Muslims across the globe.\" It is pertinent to mention that Freedom Gate Prosperity, a not-for-profit organization operating across Pakistan, advocates for inclusive development, economic empowerment of youth and women, and climate action.",
