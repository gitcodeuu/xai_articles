    "article_body": "SIALKOT, Jun 07 (APP): Federal Minister for Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif offered Eid-ul-Azha prayers at Sialkot Cantt in his constituency. After Eid prayer, Federal Defence Minister also met with people and exchanged Eid greetings. Later, Federal Minister for Defence Khawaja while talking to the media in Sialkot on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha, said that this was a day of Sunnah Ibrahimi, a day marked by sacrifice across the Muslim world. He expressed deep concern over the ongoing suffering of the people of Gaza and Palestine, stating that the entire Muslim Ummah was currently going through a time of trial. \"While sacrifices are being made in remembrance of Prophet Ibrahim, our Palestinian brothers and sisters are facing immense hardship, \"he added. Khawaja Asif lamented the silence of the Muslim world over the situation in Gaza, saying, \"Unfortunately, even prayers are being avoided for them. At the very least, we must pray for them with sincerity.\" He prayed, \"May Allah destroy their enemies and grant them victory, \"emphasizing that this is a lesson for the entire Ummah. \"Somewhere along the way, we have faltered. He also said, \"May Allah bless us with the intercession of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and remove his displeasure from us.\" The spirit of sacrifice symbolized by this day should be highlighted in the entire nation. \"We have lost our way. May Allah guide us back to the right path,\" he concluded.",
