He reiterated complete confidence in the battle preparedness of the Armed Forces to decisively deter and defeat any act of aggression. Underscoring Pakistan's principled stance, the Field Marshal affirmed that the just and valiant struggle of the Kashmiri people against Indian occupation will never be forgotten.
