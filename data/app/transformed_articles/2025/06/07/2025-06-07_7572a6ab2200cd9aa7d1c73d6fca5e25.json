    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 7 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim, a day earlier and the two leaders exchanged greetings on the auspicious occasion of Eid ul Azha. During their warm and cordial telephone call, the Prime Minister conveyed his best wishes to the Malaysian leadership and people on Eid. He prayed for unity and prosperity of the Ummah. Both leaders also prayed for peace and the safety of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, a Prime Minister's Office news release said. The prime minister conveyed his sincere gratitude to Malaysia for its support and balanced stance during the recent crisis between Pakistan and India, calling for de-escalation and dialogue. In this regard, he particularly recalled his telephone call with the Malaysian Prime Minister on May 4, 2025, at the height of the crisis. PM Shehbaz underscored that Pakistan had always strived for regional peace and stability, however, it was left with no option but to respond swiftly and decisively to India's military aggression that was directed against innocent Pakistanis and violated the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He further said that Pakistan had accepted the offer of a ceasefire understanding, brokered by the U.S. and other friendly countries, in the interest of regional peace and security. He reiterated that Pakistan was ready for dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. The two Prime Ministers also discussed Pakistan-Malaysia ties and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation in multiple fields, including trade, investment, and culture. The Prime Minister said that he looked forward to paying an official visit to Malaysia later this year for which mutually convenient dates were being worked out through diplomatic channels.",
