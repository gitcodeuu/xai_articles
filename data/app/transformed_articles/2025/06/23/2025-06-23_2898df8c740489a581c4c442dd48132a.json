    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP):The District and Sessioms Court of Islamabad on Monday sent the main suspect in the murder case of TikToker Sana Yousaf to jail after the end of his police remand. The court made the decision as the prosecution did not request further custody. Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Hafeez ordered that the accused, Umar Hayat, be sent to jail on judicial remand in the ongoing investigation of the murder of TikToker Sana Yousaf. The federal police produced Umar Hayat in court following the completion of his three-day physical remand. During the hearing, the prosecution did not seek an extension of the remand, after which the court directed that the accused be shifted to jail. Umar Hayat's lawyers raised concerns over not being allowed to arrange a meeting between their client and his parents. They told the court that the case had gained widespread media attention, and the accused was being denied access to his family. In response, the judge remarked that since the suspect had now been sent on judicial remand, such meetings could take place in jail under standard procedures.",
