    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP): Jazz, Pakistan's leading digital operator, has signed a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the British Council and Tech Valley - the Google for Education partner in Pakistan - to scale up access to digital education, capacity building, and social development initiatives nationwide. The MoU was signed at a ceremony at Jazz Headquarters and marks the beginning of a two-year collaboration aimed at bridging Pakistan's digital and educational divides. Jazz will leverage its extensive digital infrastructure and nationwide reach to deliver inclusive, tech-enabled learning programs that align with Pakistan's socio-economic development priorities, said a news release. The partnership brings together Jazz's digital leadership, the British Council's global expertise in learning frameworks, and Tech Valley's innovative role as the exclusive Google for Education partner in Pakistan. The three organizations will collaborate on teacher training, youth capacity building, and the co-design of ed-tech interventions targeting underserved communities. Syed Zaheer Mehdi, Group Chief Corporate and Regulatory Officer, said: At Jazz, we believe that access to quality education should not be defined by geography, gender, or circumstance. This partnership with the British Council and Google/Tech Valley reflects our shared commitment to harness digital technology to unlock human potential - especially for youth and women in underserved communities. Together, we're building a more inclusive and connected future - one where every learner has the tools, confidence, and opportunity to thrive.\" James Hampson, Country Director, British Council Pakistan, said: \"This partnership brings together three organizations who want Pakistan succeed. British Council is proud to team up with Google for Education/Tech Valley and Jazz bringing the best of who we are to every corner of this country. It's a first for us and we're excited about the future we're going to create together.\" Umar Farooq, CEO Tech Valley, said: \"At Tech Valley, our mission is to drive positive social impact through technology. This partnership is a game-changer for Pakistan's educational and social development trajectory. As a system integrator and a partner for Google for Education, we are combining our innovative tools and platforms with the British Council's pedagogical excellence and Jazz's unparalleled connectivity, we are building a holistic learning ecosystem that promises truly scalable impact across the nation.\" This collaboration reflects Jazz's broader commitment to building purpose-driven platforms that bridge Pakistan's digital divide. As the country's leading ServiceCo, Jazz serves over 100 million users through a portfolio spanning fintech, entertainment, self-care, InsurTech, cloud, and gaming. This evolution from connectivity to capability enables Jazz to drive inclusive growth and improve lives through technology.",
