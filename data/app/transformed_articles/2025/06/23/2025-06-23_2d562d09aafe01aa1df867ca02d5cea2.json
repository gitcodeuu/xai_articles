    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP): The National Security Committee (NSC) in its meeting on Monday, called all relevant parties to resolve the Iran-Israel conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, in line with the UN Charter and underscored the need of adhering to international human rights and humanitarian laws. Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting of the NSC to review the evolving regional situation following Israeli aggression against Iran, a Prime Minister's Office news release said. The Committee strongly condemned Israel's acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the United States. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran's right to self-defense as enshrined in the UN Charter. The Committee conveyed condolences to the Government and people of Iran on loss of innocent lives and prayed for the recovery of injured. While reiterating Pakistan's stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), relevant international law, and the UN Charter. The NSC also reaffirmed Pakistan's close engagement with relevant parties and endorsed its readiness to further continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.",
