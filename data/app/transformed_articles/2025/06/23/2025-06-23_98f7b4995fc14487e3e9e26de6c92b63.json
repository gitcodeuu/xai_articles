    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP):Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr. Fazal Chaudhry on Monday said the government remained flexible during the budget session by extending debate time, especially for opposition parties. Speaking in the National Assembly, he said both sides had agreed to hold detailed discussions on the federal budget. However, the opposition leadership demanded that all their members be allowed to speak. \"The total time given for debate was originally 48 hours and 40 minutes. Later, we added over eight more hours for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI),\" he said. He said that the SIC, Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), and other opposition members spoke for over 16 hours in total. \"This proves the government's seriousness in ensuring a full and fair debate. Many sessions continued until 10 PM at the opposition's request,\" he added. Referring to the earlier scuffle in the House, Dr. Fazal said that all parties had agreed in a parliamentary meeting that any member attacking another's seat-regardless of party-would face disciplinary action or suspension.",
