    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP):Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) of the Higher Education Commission has organised two capacity-building workshops at Aga Khan University, Karachi. According to official sources, the workshops brought together Directors of Quality Enhancement Cells from all public & private universities across Sindh and Balochistan. The events were part of QAA's national initiative to implement the new Quality Assurance Framework (PSG-2023), review progress on QAA targets assigned to degree-awarding institutions, and enhance understanding of revised HEC-QAD policies. These sessions followed earlier successful engagements in Punjab, Islamabad, GB, and AJK. Both programs concluded with certificate distribution, a guided tour of AKU's quality practices, and a collective reaffirmation to strengthen the quality assurance landscape in Pakistan.",
