    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 13 (APP):Senior Pakistan People's Party (PPP) leader Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on Friday lauded all political parties for setting aside their differences and standing together in support of the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Air Force during the recent Indian aggression. Speaking during the National Assembly's general debate on the 2025-26 federal budget, he said, \"I salute the people of Pakistan,\" adding that the unity displayed across party lines sent a powerful message to India and the world. \"Our response echoed through international corridors and showed that Pakistan stands united in times of adversity.\" He praised the nation for rising like \"a wall of lead\" alongside its armed forces and credited the military for delivering a strong and effective response. He also paid tribute to the leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and honored the sacrifices of the country's martyrs. Commenting on the budget process, Ashraf acknowledged its complexity and emphasized that it is the government's responsibility to meet the country's challenges and provide relief to all segments of society. \"No government wants to present a budget that upset the people. We must ultimately return to the court of the people,\" he remarked. He commended Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government for making difficult but necessary decisions that, he said, few others would have dared to take. He said that the financial pressures inherited by the current government and pointed to international institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, and FATF, which placed strict conditions on financial assistance. \"We were under immense pressure. Without meeting those conditions, loans would not have been possible, and default was a real risk,\" he explained. Ashraf also underlined the PPP's contributions as a coalition partner, saying the party had offered meaningful suggestions aimed at easing the burden on the poor. Highlighting Pakistan's diplomatic efforts after Indian aggression, he said, \"Once the military had responded, we had to fight a second battle - the battle of perception.\" He praised PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and his team for their efforts on international forums to represent Pakistan's case effectively. \"Their tireless work will be remembered as a proud moment in our diplomatic history,\" he stated. He also acknowledged the role of PTI and other political parties in standing with the armed forces and presenting a unified national front. He highlighted that Pakistan's challenges - both economic and geopolitical - can only be addressed through unity, vision, and collective will. He urged all political parties to move away from blame games and instead engage in practical politics focused on the welfare of the people. \"We must work together to resolve all issues through joint efforts,\" he said.",
