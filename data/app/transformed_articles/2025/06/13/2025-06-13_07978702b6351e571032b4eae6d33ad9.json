    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 13 (APP):Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Professor Ahsan Iqbal has condemned Israel's aggression against Iran and demanded that the international community take notice of this act of aggression. Speaking to journalists at the media center outside the Parliament House on Friday, he said that Israel's aggression against Iran was condemned in the both houses of Parliament today,\"I also condemn it\". He strongly condemned Israel's aggression against Iran and said that this aggression of Israel is a serious threat to regional and global peace. The international community should take notice of its act of aggression. He said that during the budget session speech of the Finance Minister, the opposition has damaged the microfinace system of opposition benches.The microphone system was installed in the Parliament House in 1994, but the opposition has never protested in any era that caused damage to property. Ahsan Iqbal said that the current opposition's protest has damaged the The cost of replacing the microphone system will be Rs 350 million and I think this money should be collected from the salaries of these opposition members - But I want to remind them that when this brave man was in the House, he used to say on the Indian false flag operation, tell me what should I do, should I attack India, during his government he had released Abhi Nandan within 24 hours and handed him over to India. He said that I don't know whose eyes the PTI members are throwing dust in, when India attacked Pakistan in 2019, Imran Khan was standing helplessly in the House and they are calling it bravery. During his rule, he did not have the money to pay the IMF installment, salaries and pensions were also paid on loan, he left the country close to bankruptcy and on April 1, 2022, PTI bankrupted the country, but Alhamdulillah today, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan is now heading towards growth again. The restoration of Pakistan's economy is being appreciated all over the world, international rating agencies are appreciating economic improvement and performance. Our rating is moving towards high, and for this we do not need any certificate from PTI. Ahsan Iqbal said that till May 6, PTI's narrative was that Pakistan's fate was ruined, PTI did not tire of criticizing the Pakistan Army. He said that now again PTI is spreading disappointment among the nation. He said that today PTI is calling for a demonstration on the visit of Field Marshal to the US. He said that there is no difference between the narratives of PTI and India and that is why PTI used to get foreign funding from India and Israel and that is why this party is working on the agenda of Israel and India. Ahsan Iqbal said that there is no room for PTI's style of politics in Pakistan, the founder of PTI is not a political prisoner but has been caught stealing 190 million pounds. The Federal Minister for Planning said that PTI should hold its leader accountable for the economic downturn. He said that Imran Khan has committed the biggest political robbery in the history of Pakistan. Instead of playing the desk in the assembly, they should grab the collar of the founder PTI in Adiala Jail. The founding chairman has committed corruption worth sixty billion rupees. A modern and well-equipped Danish University will be established with the amount of sixty billion rupees. Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal said that the Tehreek-e-Insaf has damaged Pakistan's relations with friendly countries and isolated the country on the economic and diplomatic front. The current government has restored relations with friendly countries again. He said that today there is criticism against India all over the world. In response to a question, he said that the PML-N has always maintained that the army should stay away from politics and there should be no political engineering and when the army is asking to stay away from political processes, the founder PTI is not taking the name of a political leader for talks but wants to talk to the establishment.",
