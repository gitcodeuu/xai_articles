    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 13 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar on Friday strongly condemned the \"unjustified\" Israeli attacks on Iran, calling it a brazen violation of Iran's sovereignty. The deputy prime minister, in a statement on his X timeline, said that this abhorrent action had shaken the foundations of international law as well as the conscience of humanity. Besides, the Israeli strikes also gravely undermined regional stability and international security, he added. The deputy prime minister reiterated that Pakistan stood in solidarity with the Government and the people of Iran. Earlier, the Foreign Office spokesperson also said that the Israeli military strikes violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran and clearly contravene the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the FO spokesperson added.",
