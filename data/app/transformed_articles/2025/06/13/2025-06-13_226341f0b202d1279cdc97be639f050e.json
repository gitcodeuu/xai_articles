    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 13 (APP):Federal Minister for Railways, Muhammad Hanif Abbasi Friday strongly condemned the recent Israeli aggression against Iran, calling it a grave threat to regional peace and stability. In a statement issued here, Hanif Abbasi said the Israeli attack on Iran is \"unacceptable and highly condemnable.\" He expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of Chief of Staff of the Iranian armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri and paid tribute to his service. He also denounced the killing of Major General Hossein Salami, Commander-in-Chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), saying that such targeted assassinations are a dangerous escalation and deserve global condemnation. The minister said that prominent Iranian nuclear scientists Dr. Mohammad Mahdi Tehranchi and Dr. Fereydoon Abbasi were also martyred in the attack. \"The loss of innocent lives is a crime against humanity,\" Hanif Abbasi added, urging the international community to take strong notice and respond decisively to Israel's blatant aggression.",
