    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, June 13 (APP):Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) Chairman, Dr. Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi on Friday strongly condemned Israel's military assault on Iran, warning that the Zionist state's expansionist ambitions pose a serious threat to global peace and stability. Speaking at the Friday congregation at Darul Uloom Jamia Naeemia in Lahore, Dr. Naeemi expressed grave concern that Israel's actions could potentially trigger a third world war, urging major world powers to intervene immediately to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Iran. \"This blatant act of aggression is a clear violation of Iran's sovereignty and a direct threat to the region's peace and stability,\" he said. \"The international community must not remain silent. It must take urgent notice of Israeli aggression and act swiftly to prevent a larger humanitarian catastrophe.\" He emphasized that Iran, under international law, reserves the right to defend itself and respond to unprovoked military aggression. \"Such military strikes not only endanger Iran but could ignite a wider conflict with devastating long-term consequences,\" Dr. Naeemi added. The CII chairman also condemned the killing of Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists, saying that the people of Pakistan stand in solidarity with Iran. \"Had the international community taken serious action against Israel's oppressive actions in Gaza, it would not have dared to launch this attack on Iran,\" he noted, adding that the Muslim world's collective weakness is emboldening Israel to advance its agenda unchecked. In his address, Dr. Naeemi also commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of his father, the late Dr. Sarfraz Naeemi, a revered Islamic scholar and anti-terrorism advocate. He recalled how his father issued a landmark Fatwa (religious decree) against terrorism on October 14, 2008, which ultimately led to his assassination in a suicide bombing on June 12, 2009, alongside four of his close disciples. \"Dr. Sarfraz Naeemi sacrificed his life for the protection of Islam and our beloved country. His services to the nation, religion, and humanity will always be remembered,\" he said. Dr. Naeemi concluded by calling on the Muslim world to unite in the face of rising aggression and to collectively safeguard the interests of peace, justice, and sovereignty in the region.",
