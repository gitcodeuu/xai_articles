    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 13 (APP):Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, on Friday strongly condemned the recent Israeli attack on Iran, saying the move has dangerously destabilized the region. \"This act has put regional peace at serious risk,\" he expressed these views while initiating debate on budget 2025-26 in the National Assembly. Ayub also praised the Pakistan Armed Forces for their timely and powerful response to recent Indian aggression. \"Our military responded quickly and effectively, sending a clear message to India. Their bravery and sacrifices deserve our deepest respect,\" he said. He warned that any future hostile move from India would trigger an even stronger reply. \"The nation is united. If India crosses the line again, Pakistan's response will be far more powerful,\" he said. Ayub underlined the need to strengthen Pakistan's defence. \"We must keep upgrading our armed forces with modern weapons. He emphasized that the country's sovereignty must be protected at all costs. \"There can be no compromise on national independence,\" he stressed.",
