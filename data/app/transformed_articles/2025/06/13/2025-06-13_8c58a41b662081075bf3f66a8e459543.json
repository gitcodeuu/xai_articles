In his statement, Barrister Chaudhry emphasized, \"Pakistan stands in unwavering solidarity with Iran, our brotherly Muslim nation that was the first country to recognize Pakistan after independence in 1947. This unanimous resolution reflects Pakistan's united stance against Israeli aggression.\" He urgently called upon the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to convene an emergency session immediately to formulate collective action against Zionist atrocities.",
