Taking part in the budget debate in the National Assembly, members underscored the importance of continued investment in agriculture to enhance food security and uplift rural areas. They also highlighted the need to expand hydropower generation to provide affordable, sustainable energy and reduce dependence on expensive imports. Resuming the budget debate, Raja Qamar-ul-Islam of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) praised the budget as historic and lauded the role of Pakistan's armed forces in sending a firm message to India. He expressed confidence that the budget 2025-26 would pave the way for sustainable economic growth in the country.

Rana Muhammad Hayat, a senior leader from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), criticized the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government for plunging the country into economic and energy crises. He lauded the current leadership under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, saying that economic indicators are now moving in the right direction, and expressed optimism about continued national progress. Rana Hayat proposed the creation of a special House committee to focus on the problems faced by farmers, a vital segment of the economy. He also strongly condemned Israeli aggression against innocent civilians of Iran, calling on the international community to take meaningful action for restoring regional peace. Rana Hayat paid tribute to PM Shehbaz Sharif, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the armed forces for delivering a strong and timely response to Indian provocations. Usama Ahmed Mela, MNA from the SIC also condemned the Israeli attack on Iran and urged the government to convene a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to formulate a united and forceful response from the Muslim world.
