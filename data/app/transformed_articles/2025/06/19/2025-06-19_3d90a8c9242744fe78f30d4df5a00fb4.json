    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 19 (APP):The Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), in collaboration with the Petroleum Institute of Pakistan (PIP), held the launch of their joint research study titled \"Pakistan's Energy Sector: Need for Strategic and Commercial Storages (Oil and Gas)\" here. The study presents an examination of the need for oil and gas storage infrastructure in Pakistan amid global energy transitions and domestic challenges, said a press release issued on Thursday. The event brought together guests including representatives from think tanks, academic institutions, the diplomatic corps, journalists, and stakeholders from Pakistan's energy and policy sectors. The discussion focused on the need to develop a national strategy for energy storage to improve energy security, reduce vulnerability to supply disruptions, and stabilize supply chains. The event was opened by President IPRI, Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Majid Ehsan, HI(M), who spoke on the importance of policymaking in energy security and cooperation between public and private sectors. He noted that the launch of the study is part of ongoing efforts to support policy discussions and identify practical steps for the energy sector. The keynote address was delivered by Ambassador Inam-ul-Haq, Chairman of the Board of Governors at IPRI. He said energy is a key strategic issue and called on policymakers and industry professionals to focus on energy storage as a necessary part of Pakistan's economic planning and national security. The speaker panel included Brigadier Dr. Raashid Wali Janjua (Retd.), Director Research at IPRI; Mr. Shehryar Omar, CEO of the Petroleum Institute of Pakistan (PIP); and Mr. Muhammad Aamir Salim, Executive Director (Petroserv) at Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL). Brigadier Dr. Raashid Wali Janjua, while outlining the study's main points, called it \"a humble first step in the roadmap towards strategic storages.\" He discussed the need for a policy approach that brings together long-term planning, technical input, and private-sector involvement to create oil and gas storage capacity. Mr. Shehryar Omar shared an industry perspective, saying that \"energy security is the cornerstone of national progress.\" He noted that in a time of global change across political, economic, and technological areas, Pakistan must take steps to ensure continuous access to affordable energy. Mr. Muhammad Aamir Salim spoke about trends in energy demand before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The energy demand came back post-COVID,\" he said, explaining that demand fell during the pandemic and increased afterward, adding pressure to energy systems. He highlighted the role of strategic reserves in protecting against price changes and supply problems. The research study is intended to support further discussion and provide recommendations for developing energy storage as part of Pakistan's energy planning.",
