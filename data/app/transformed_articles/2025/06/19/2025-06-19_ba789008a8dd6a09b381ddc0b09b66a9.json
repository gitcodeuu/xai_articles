    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 19 (APP):For over a decade, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) has served as Pakistan's largest social protection intervention through offering crucial relief to families living below the poverty line. Established as a legacy of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, BISP was envisioned as a pro-poor, people-first model designed to provide dignity and support during economic hardship. With a portfolio that includes Benazir Kafalat, Benazir Taleemi Wazaif, Benazir Undergraduate Scholarships, Benazir Nashonuma etc., the programme addresses multiple dimensions of deprivation. But now, BISP is embarking on a transformational shift-moving from support to self-reliance-with the upcoming launch of the Benazir Hunarmand Programme (BHP). For the first time in its history, BISP is launching a structured skills development initiative focused on building the capacity of its beneficiaries through market-relevant, competency-based training. The goal is to equip families of BISP beneficiaries with the practical skills they need to secure sustainable livelihoods. \"BISP is no longer just about financial support. With the Benazir Hunarmand Programme, we are enabling people to stand on their own feet with dignity and direction,\" Senator Rubina Khalid, Chairperson BISP said. She emphasized BISP's deep commitment to the long-term uplift of its beneficiaries, saying: \"We are not only helping ease their lives but also working to enhance their livelihoods and increase their income. We understand that acquiring valuable skills leads to better opportunities and higher incomes. What sets us apart is our focus on not just offering training, but ensuring that the trained youth are fully equipped and employable in the job market.\" This shift is anchored in the enduring vision of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, who believed that \"skill is your asset\" considering the reality that financial assistance can offer temporary relief, but skill-building offers long-term transformation. The Benazir Hunarmand Programme is designed to help individuals move beyond survival and take steps toward economic independence. BISP's impact has transcended political divides. Over the years, it has been owned, supported, and continued by every successive government regardless of political affiliation due to its effectiveness. This rare national consensus is a testament to the programme's effectiveness, transparency, and direct reach to the most vulnerable segments of society. While the Benazir Kafalat assistance offers critical support-often used for basic household needs or children's education-it is not enough to meet all the needs of a family. Beneficiaries are well aware of this reality, and many see the Hunarmand Programme as an opportunity to strengthen their income and secure a better future. \"The cash assistance from BISP and educational stipends helped us keep our children in school and manage small household expenses, but it's never been enough on its own,\" says Shazia Bibi, a widow from Multan. \"I wish to learn tailoring through this new programme as even a small skill can help me bring in regular income to meet my household expenses and live a dignified life\", she added. In Peshawar, Rubina Khan who is a BISP beneficiary, said, \"BISP's financial support gave us some breathing space, but I still struggle daily to earn enough. If any of my sons can get proper training in welding or plumbing, I might be able to earn better and more consistently.\" For Sughran bibi, hailing from outskirts of capital, the stipend helped her family during hard times, but she sees the new programme as the real opportunity. \"If my children could learn digital skills, we can start earning online. That's the kind of change we need-not just help, but a way forward.\" This is an undeniable fact that BISP support has never been a replacement for proper income, but it has been a vital buffer, however now, with the introduction of BHP, the focus is on unlocking potential-not just easing hardship. By offering structured training in the market-oriented skills, the Benazir Hunarmand Programme seeks to open doors that were previously closed to the underprivileged. Special emphasis is being placed on training women, youth, and rural beneficiaries, enabling them to participate in the workforce in new and meaningful ways. A dedicated Hunarmand portal will help connect beneficiaries to training opportunities across the country, track their progress, and eventually facilitate employment access. As the programme launches on June 21, the birth anniversary of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, it does more than honor her legacy-it reaffirms her belief in the dignity and strength of Pakistan's -people. The Benazir Hunarmand Programme is not a replacement of BISP's core support; it is the next step. It is the opportunity to rise beyond subsistence to live with purpose, to earn with pride, and to contribute to the country's economy with skill and confidence. Because for the millions who struggle every day to make ends meet, what they need is not just relief but a real chance to rewrite their futures.",
