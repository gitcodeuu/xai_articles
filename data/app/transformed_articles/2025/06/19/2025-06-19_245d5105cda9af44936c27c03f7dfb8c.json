    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 19 (APP):Leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F), Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Thursday said that the job of the opposition is to highlight the government's mistakes and guide it towards better policies. While speaking in the National Assembly during the budget session, Maulana said that he is not an expert in economics but has been listening to budget speeches in Parliament since 1988. \"Every year, every government says the same thing that this budget will help the economy grow and benefit the people. But when we look at the past 15 to 20 years, we have to ask: have we really made progress or are we going backwards?\" He pointed out that Pakistan has even seen times when its GDP growth went negative. \"Last year, we couldn't even reach half of the growth target set by the government. No major reforms were introduced, and no new hope was given to the people,\" he said. Chief JUI-F added that he regularly follows news reports and talks with people from different walks of life, and almost everyone is critical of the current budget. \"No one is calling this a good or hopeful budget. Then how can you expect me to praise it?\" he asked. \"The public opinion is clear this budget disappointing.\" Talking about the country's security and peace, he said that a peaceful environment is necessary for economic growth. \"Since 9/11, our country has seen violence and unrest. Things that were once seen as crimes have sadly become normal in our society. People no longer feel safe,\" he said. He said that although India is 10 to 15 times bigger and stronger than Pakistan, the Pakistani military bravely defended the country. \"This was not just a Pakistan-India war, it was a Pakistan-Modi war,\" he said. \"Even minorities in Pakistan stood with the government and army, while India's people were divided.\" Maulana appreciated the sacrifices made by Pakistan's people and armed forces for the country's safety. \"We have given our blood for this country. I fully respect the sacrifices of our soldiers.\" Talking about the situation in Palestine, he said that around 60,000 Palestinians have been martyred, and Israel continues its attacks on countries like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and now Iran. He criticized world powers for not taking action. Maulana called on Pakistan to take a leadership role in the Muslim world. \"We are a strong country with a strong army. We must stand with our Muslim brothers, especially in Gaza and Palestine.\" He called for a major change in the country's politics. \"We don't need traditional politics anymore. We need a revolution. Real justice for the people will lead to a better economy,\" he said.",
