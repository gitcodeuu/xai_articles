    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 19 (APP):The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has launched a stringent recovery campaign, directing all defaulters to clear their outstanding dues by June 30, 2025, or face legal action, including property seizures and public naming. The decision was finalized during a high-level meeting at the CDA Headquarters, chaired by Acting Chairman Talat Mehmood on Thursday and attended by senior officials, including members of the Environment, Planning, and Recovery wings. A dedicated committee, led by DG Recovery, has been formed to expedite the retrieval of long-pending dues. The authority aims to recover unpaid property and development charges, outstanding water bills, defaulted instalments on commercial/residential plots and unsettled transfer fees. To facilitate payments, the CDA's One Window Facilitation Center will extend its operating hours from 9 AM to 9 PM until the deadline. Defaulters failing to meet the June 30 cutoff will face heavy some fines and penalties, legal proceedings, including property sealing and auction as well 3 public disclosure of names and property details in newspapers. Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa has taken personal charge of the initiative, ensuring strict enforcement. The recovered funds will be channeled into Islamabad's infrastructure development and civic projects. The CDA has issued a final warning, urging citizens and businesses to settle dues immediately to avoid punitive measures. For assistance, the public can visit the CDA's facilitation center or contact the designated helpline.",
