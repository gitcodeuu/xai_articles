    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 19 (APP):Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das Thursday said that Pakistan's minorities are the 'Crown of the Nation' and that the country has given them respect and status. Responding to points raised by MNA Naveed Amir Jeeva during the budget session of the National Assembly, he said \"We are the sons of this soil and reaffirming the government's commitment to the rights and welfare of minorities. The minister said that after the 18th Constitutional Amendment, the Ministry of Minority Affairs was devolved to the provinces and the provincial governments are now allocating appropriate funds for minority communities. Kesoo Mal said that he would speak to Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif about allocating development funds for minority and women members elected on reserved seats. \"Despite the devolution, the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination still holds funds for minority-related initiatives,\" he said. Highlighting Pakistan's commitment to religious freedom, the minister contrasted the situation in Pakistan with that of a neighboring country, where, he said, minorities face far more discrimination. He emphasized that Pakistan's Constitution ensures protection and religious freedom for all minority communities. Meanwhile, Parliamentary Secretary for Communication Gul Asghar Khan said that Pakistan has taken strong diplomatic stances against Israeli aggression by passing resolutions in both the National Assembly and Senate. He urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to also play its due role on the issue. \"We have taught India a lesson,\" and highlighted the government's efforts in institutional reforms, including mining reforms and significant downsizing. He said that 40,500 government positions had been eliminated under downsizing initiatives and that reforms in Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are expected to save the country around Rs 3 trillion. On climate change, Asghar Khan said that international financial institutions are expected to provide $40 billion in support to help Pakistan tackle environmental challenges. Asghar Khan said that Tehsil Noorpur Thal in his constituency remains the most underdeveloped area in the province, lacking road infrastructure and a university. He expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister for establishing a COMSATS campus, an organic food park, an expressway and an industrial zone in the area.",
