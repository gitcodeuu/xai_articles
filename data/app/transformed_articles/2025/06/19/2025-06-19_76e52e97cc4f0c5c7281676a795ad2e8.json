    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 19 (APP):Students and faculty members from the Department of English at Capital University of Science and Technology (CUST) visited the Allama Iqbal Open University on Thursday. The primary objective of this visit was to introduce the students to Pakistan's national and regional languages, their literature, and the integration of modern technology with these linguistic traditions, said a press release on Thursday. The visit began at the Center for Language and Translation Studies, where the students were given a detailed briefing on the academic, cultural, and social significance of Pakistani languages. During the session, the students listened to a radio program based on Saadat Hasan Manto's short story \"Tamasha,\" translated into Punjabi. This program was inspired by the tragic Jallianwala Bagh massacre and was the result of extensive research by PhD scholars at the university. Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Ghulam Ali, Director of the Center, announced that the university is producing a radio movie based on this timeless Urdu short story, which will soon be aired on national radio. He emphasized the need to align national and regional languages with modern technological platforms such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to enhance their global representation and ensure their preservation. Dr. Ghulam Ali further stated that the protection of languages should not remain confined to academic activities, but must be adapted to the needs of the digital age. The students were also briefed about various research, creative, and technical projects undertaken by the Center. Professor Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan, Dr. Lubna Umar, Dr. Farukh Abbas, and Director of Student Affairs Syed Ghulam Kazim Ali also addressed the students. They provided insightful perspectives on the evolution, future, and modern dimensions of language and literature. At the conclusion of the visit, the students highly appreciated the research and literary initiatives of Allama Iqbal Open University and described the experience as an academic, intellectual, and memorable journey. They noted that it not only enhanced their understanding and insight but also instilled a renewed vision for the preservation and promotion of national languages.",
