    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 29 (APP):Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police have finalized an extensive security plan for Muharram-ul-Haram, deploying over 16,000 personnel from police, Rangers and other law enforcement agencies to ensure peace and order during 181 mourning processions and 965 Majalis scheduled to take place across the federal capital from 1st Muharram to 19th Safar. A public relations officer told APP on Sunday that the comprehensive plan is being implemented under the direct supervision of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, who is personally monitoring the overall arrangements. He said a central control room has been established at Safe City Islamabad to monitor all religious gatherings and processions through more than 3,000 surveillance cameras and aerial drones. Ten vigilance teams have also been formed to inspect and ensure the effectiveness of security deployments. He said all DIGs, SSPs, and AIGs of Islamabad Police have been assigned duties at various sensitive points, while daily search operations are being conducted across the district to prevent any untoward incident. He said special Dolphin Force squads will be patrolling the surroundings of Majalis and procession routes, while over 500 traffic officers have been deployed to maintain traffic flow and facilitate citizens. He said coordinated efforts are underway among multiple departments including Operations, Security Division, Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP), Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), Special Branch, and Logistics Wing. He said male and female volunteers and police officers have been given detailed briefings and special training sessions for their respective Muharram duties. Female police personnel have been deployed to ensure checking and security at female-specific Majalis and gatherings. He said all senior police officers, including DIGs, SSPs, and SPs, are paying regular visits to Imam Bargahs and procession sites to inspect on-ground arrangements. He said separate parking zones have been designated for cars and motorcycles near Majalis and procession routes to prevent congestion and maintain emergency access. He appealed to citizens to extend full cooperation with police during the sacred month and report any suspicious activity immediately by dialing emergency helpline PUKAAR-15. He also advised residents to stay tuned to FM Radio 92.4 for daily traffic and security updates during the Muharram period.",
