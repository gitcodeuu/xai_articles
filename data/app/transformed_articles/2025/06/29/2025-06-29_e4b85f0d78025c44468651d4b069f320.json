Addressing the meeting, Zarar Hasham Khan, Chairman of the Board, said that under the leadership of Federal Minister for IT & Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja, the USF is revolutionising the digital landscape of Pakistan. \"Not only we are launching new projects, but we're also ensuring the timely completion of our ongoing initiatives, strictly adhering to our targets.\" Chairman of the Board added that USF's transformative projects have empowered over 37 million people, bridging the digital divide and unlocking opportunities for talented youth and women from remote areas to thrive as freelancers and start-ups. This monumental achievement underscores USF's pivotal role in catapulting Pakistan's IT industry to new heights and significantly boosting IT exports, thereby cementing the nation's position as a burgeoning tech hub. Chief Executive USF, Chaudhry Mudassar Naveed, briefed the meeting on ongoing, completed, and upcoming projects. The Board appreciated USF's contributions to spreading connectivity in far-flung areas, noting that its projects not only provide digital connectivity but also significantly support the development of Pakistan's IT and telecom sector, particularly by enhancing input connectivity in rural and remote areas, which has a substantial impact. According to the details of a landmark decision, the USF Board approved the award of seven transformative projects to the lowest bidder after fulfilling the due process, ushering in a new era of digital connectivity in Pakistan.
