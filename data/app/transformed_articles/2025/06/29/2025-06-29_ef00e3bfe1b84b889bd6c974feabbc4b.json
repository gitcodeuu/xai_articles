    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 29 (APP):Engineers are widely regarded as the backbone of any nation's development by designing the infrastructure, technology, and systems that power modern life. Yet in developing countries like Pakistan, despite their qualifications, skills and tireless contributions, engineers have long struggled to attain the recognition, status, and opportunities they deserve both at home and abroad. In this context, the landmark Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) signed between the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and the Chinese Society of Engineers (CSE-CAST) is nothing short of a breath of fresh air and for many in Pakistan's engineering community, a long-awaited breakthrough. The agreement formally grants PEC-registered engineers the right to work in China without undergoing additional assessments or licensing exams, offering not just jobs but validation, dignity, and a gateway to global practice. It's a game-changer-one that lifts the weight of years of structural limitations and unlocks doors to some of the world's most advanced and demanding engineering sectors. With just a PEC registration in hand, Pakistani engineers can now contribute to mega-projects across energy, smart infrastructure, ICT, and research in China, and by extension, across many Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member countries-without navigating complex administrative processes or licensing obstacles. The agreement, signed recently in Chengdu, is not just a bilateral formality-it is a powerful endorsement of the technical caliber of Pakistan's engineering community. It places Pakistani engineers on equal footing with their Chinese counterparts and sends a strong message of trust, mutual respect, and professional parity. This breakthrough is largely attributed to the proactive vision and diplomatic engagement of the PEC Governing Body (2024-2027), which has made global recognition a cornerstone of its reform agenda. The leadership's strategic foresight has translated into a rare moment of international validation for Pakistan's engineering standards. \"This agreement is a clear vote of confidence in Pakistan's engineers,\" said Engr. Waseem Nazir, Chairman of PEC. \"It reinforces our mission to raise the standing of Pakistan's engineering profession on the global stage. It will not only help our youth access better opportunities abroad but will also promote Pakistan as a hub of reliable technical expertise.\" Beyond symbolic recognition, the agreement has practical and far-reaching implications. Degrees from PEC and CEEAA-accredited institutions will now be accepted in both countries without revalidation. The scope of practice is wide-allowing licensed engineers to participate in a range of infrastructure and innovation sectors, provided they comply with local regulations and codes of ethics. A joint PEC-CSE working group will handle professional oversight, continuous professional development (CPD) programs, and credential verification. This is a historic opening for Pakistani engineers among many of whom have the talent and ambition but lacked the international channels to fully utilize their skills. As engineers cross into Chinese markets, their presence will not only boost Pakistan's service exports and remittance inflows but also elevate the country's image as a source of world-class human capital. The timing of this breakthrough is deeply aligned with the broader institutional reforms PEC has been pursuing under Engr. Waseem Nazir's leadership. Talking to APP, the Chairman had outlined his vision for transforming Pakistan's engineering education and practice to meet 21st-century demands. He emphasized the need to revise outdated policies, integrate emerging technologies like AI, and prepare engineers for global competitiveness. \"The world has changed dramatically, and policies that worked even two years ago may no longer be relevant,\" Nazir had said. \"If our engineers move abroad, they should contribute to innovation, not just settle for survival jobs.\" That philosophy has fueled a series of strategic initiatives by PEC. Over 78 reforms were launched within a few months of Nazir's appointment. A standout among them is a three-year national program to train 45,000 engineers in Generative AI, with thousands already certified by Silicon Valley experts. New \"PEC Desks\" are being established in universities to fast-track engineering registration, while curriculum upgrades are being carried out to align with international benchmarks. Nazir's emphasis on professional ethics, quality assurance, and engineer-technologist-technician coordination also reflects a broader cultural shift PEC is driving-one where engineering is not just about projects, but purpose. \"Every structure we see-the buildings we work in, the cars we drive-exists because of engineers. Their contributions must be acknowledged, and their standing elevated,\" he said. The MRA with China is a real-world realization of that vision. It's not a future promise-it's a present achievement. Engineers trained in Pakistan are now equipped not just for domestic projects but for global participation, innovation, and leadership. As this new chapter unfolds, one thing is clear: Pakistan's engineers are no longer waiting at the gate. They are stepping onto the global stage-credentialed, capable, and finally recognized.",
