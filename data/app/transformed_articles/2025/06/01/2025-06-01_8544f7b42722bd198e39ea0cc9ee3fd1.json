    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 01 (APP):Pakistan Navy (PN) successfully conducted a comprehensive two-day exercise focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours of Pakistan. The exercises were aimed at validating and refining Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to ensure robust defence of critical maritime infrastructure against evolving asymmetric threats, according to a news release from the Director General of Public Relations (Navy). The exercise involved coordinated operations by PN Fleet units, Pak Marines, SSG (Navy) and Naval Aviation assets. The exercise scenarios were designed to simulate a range of sub-conventional threats, including sabotage, infiltration and unconventional attacks, enabling participating units to enhance inter-agency coordination, situational awareness and rapid response capabilities. During exercise Commander Coast Rear Admiral Faisal Amin visited various operational setups at ports and harbours and witnessed live action simulations carried out by participating units. COMCOAST appreciated the high level of preparedness and professional conduct demonstrated during the exercises. He emphasised the importance of maritime installations and added that the secure functioning of ports and harbours is directly linked to national economic stability and growth. Pakistan Navy remains committed to maintaining a high state of readiness to respond to all forms of threats and continues to strengthen its capacity to defend the maritime frontiers against emerging challenges.",
