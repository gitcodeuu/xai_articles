    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 1 (APP):The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) has successfully conducted the National Registration Examination (NRE-I) 2025 in four cities. According to PMDC, the National Registration Examination NRE-I was held on Sunday in compliance with Section 18 of the PM&DC Act 2022 in examination centers in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar. The NRE is a mandatory licensing exam designed to evaluate the competency of foreign-qualified MBBS and BDS graduates of Pakistani nationality who seek full registration as General Practitioners in Pakistan. A total of 5,036 graduates nationwide were registered for the NRE-I exam, in which 4,995 were MBBS graduates and 41 were BDS registered graduates. In Karachi 390 MBBS and one BDS graduates appeared. In Islamabad 1,583 MBBS, 19 BDS, in Peshawar 442 MBBS, three BDS and in Lahore 2,538 MBBS and 15 BDS graduates appeared simultaneously. The theory examination began at 9:30 AM and lasted 03 hours and 30 minutes. The NRE examination consists of two parts NRE I and NRE II. The Candidates must pass both components separately with a minimum score of 60%. President PM&DC, Prof. Rizwan Taj, in a statement, said that the examination has been conducted under the supervision of the National University of Medical Sciences (NUMS) in a transparent and disciplined manner. Prof. Taj advised the aspiring medical students to only enroll in recognized international institutions listed by the PM&DC and they must provide quality education so that when these graduates come back to Pakistan can pass the licensing exam and can get absorbed in the national health system and serve their country. He added that all parents and students must check the recognised list of international medical and dental colleges, as no graduate from an unrecognised institution will be registered with PM&DC. He stated that the PM&DC is committed to ensure excellence in medical and dental education while pursuing uniform minimum standards. He added that the NRE II examination schedule will also be communicated on the PM&DC official website as soon as the NRE I exam result is announced.",
