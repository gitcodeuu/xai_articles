    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 01 (APP):The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration has taken steps to regulate the sale of sacrificial animals by limiting trade to six approved cattle markets. In this regard, the district administration has launched an operation to remove illegal sale points and urged citizens to avoid buying animals from unauthorized sellers, said the spokesman of ICT administration here Sunday. Despite these arrangements, some traders have set up sale points at various other locations, including roadsides, causing inconvenience and traffic problems. In response, the district administration has launched a crackdown on these unauthorized sale points. Several such points have already been dismantled. Deputy Commissioner Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon, has appealed to the residents not to purchase animals from illegal sale points. He said these traders not only violate the rules but also block traffic and disturb public movement. \"Selling animals on roadsides creates traffic jams and safety concerns,\" said the Deputy Commissioner. \"People should cooperate and only buy animals from the markets set up for this purpose.\" Meanwhile, Assistant commissioners have been instructed to take strict action against traders operating outside the approved markets. The operation aims to ensure that animal trade remains organized and doesn't affect the city's daily life. Officials say that maintaining discipline in animal trading during Eid season is important for public safety and smooth traffic flow. In previous years, the presence of animals on busy roads has caused several problems, including accidents and traffic blockages. This year, the administration has marked six areas within the capital for legal animal trade. These designated markets have been set up with arrangements for buyers, sellers, and animals. They include space for animal pens, basic facilities, and proper management to handle the crowd. So far, buying and selling at these markets is underway without any major issue. Authorities are monitoring the situation closely. Additional teams have been formed to identify and remove any new illegal sale points that may emerge in the coming days. The district administration has also issued warnings to traders and buyers. Those found violating the rules may face legal action, including fines and seizure of animals. To spread awareness, announcements and posters have been placed across the city, guiding people to the approved markets and informing them about the rules. Deputy Commissioner Memon said that cooperation from the public is essential. He requested residents to help the administration by reporting any illegal sale points in their areas. \"We want to make this Eid safe and organized for everyone,\" he added. \"Following the rules will benefit both the citizens and the traders.\"",
