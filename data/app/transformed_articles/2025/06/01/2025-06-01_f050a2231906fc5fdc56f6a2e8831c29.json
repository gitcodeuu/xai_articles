Speaking at a reception hosted to Bangladesh and Pakistan Men's cricket teams at the Governor's House here on Sunday, he said the Pakistan government is trying to work together to build a stronger relationship, adding that it cannot happen overnight but we need to keep investing in people and come up with solutions to take our relations to new heights. The Bangladesh cricket team is in Pakistan to play a three-match T20I series and is due to play the third and last T20I on Sunday night. Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, Chairman PCB Mohsin Naqvi, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan Muhammad Iqbal Hussain, BCB cricket Operations Head Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, Advisor to Chairman PCB Amir Mir, team officials, and members of Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket teams were present.

He also recognized the progress made by Bangladesh over the past 50 years, adding Bangladesh is a success story in the world both financially as well as in human resource capital and everybody knows. \"Allah has given you strength financially and in the form of manpower,\" he added. President Zardari said Bangladesh was destined to progress and prosper vis a vis exports business and Pakistan will contribute as much as it can. Reminiscing on the shared history and pangs of separation as brothers when the two brothers parted ways in 1971, President Zardari said the younger generation was not aware of the pain we had gone through as the older generation, adding that we had broken each other's hearts in the past and there was a need to mend the hearts today, emphasizing the need for reconciliation and mutual understanding-a message that resonated deeply in his address.

And I hope that there will be many such trips\". President Zardari also expressed the desire to visit Bangladesh, adding that he had not been to Dhaka for a long time.
