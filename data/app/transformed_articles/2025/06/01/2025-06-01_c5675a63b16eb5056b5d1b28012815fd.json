    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 01 (APP):The Global Water Organisation (GWO) officially launched its operations from its headquarters in Riyadh. The event marked a major milestone in fostering international collaboration to address global water challenges, said a press release received here on Sunday. Pakistan is one of the founding members of GWO. Federal Minister for Water Resources, Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo represented Pakistan in the event on the invitation of Saudi Arabia's Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture H.E. Abdul Rahman Bin Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadley to share Pakistan's perspective. Pakistan along with other founding members signed the GWO charter formally committing to the organisation's shared vision of strengthening international cooperation on water scarcity, sustainable resource management, and climate resilience, particularly in arid and water stressed regions. Pakistan also offered to establish GWO sub-office in Pakistan. It is pertinent to mention that GWO has started its operations under the visionary leadership of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince H.E. Mohammad Bin Salman and patronage of Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture H.E. Abdul Rahman Bin Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadley.",
