    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP):MNA Major (R) Tahir Iqbal stated that Israel had violated Iran's sovereignty, and under the United Nations Charter, Iran has the full right to defend itself. Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House, he said that Israel is acting as a terrorist state and is continuously expanding its aggressive actions. He added that Pakistan will continue to extend its diplomatic, political, and moral support in this matter. Commenting on the broader implications, he said that a war between Iran and Israel would have a serious impact on the region, and neighboring countries would also suffer severely. He emphasized that it is high time for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to take concrete and practical steps, rather than issuing mere verbal statements, to stop the conflict as soon as possible. In response to a question, he said that the government had presented a commendable budget, especially in light of global inflation trends. He further mentioned that the government is taking various measures to provide maximum relief to the public.",
