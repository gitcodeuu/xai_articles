    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP): The Prime Minister's Youth Programme (PMYP) and Fauji Foundation (FF) signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) to promote youth empowerment, academic excellence, and skill development across the country. A landmark meeting was held at the Prime Minister's Office, chaired by Chairman Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan of the Prime Minister's Youth Programme (PMYP), which marked a significant step towards empowering Pakistan's youth. This strategic partnership would bring together the institutional strengths, resources, and vision of both organizations to create meaningful opportunities for high-performing students in academics and sports. By working together, PMYP and Fauji Foundation aim to enhance educational outcomes, groom young talent, and build employability skills that prepare youth for success on both national and international platforms. The collaboration will benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including students and faculty from Fauji Foundation's Education Division, youth engaged in PMYP interventions, and associated support staff. The two organizations plan to launch a series of joint programs, including scholarships, academic and sports competitions, global education partnerships, technical training, digital skill-building, teacher training, and civic education. Through this partnership, PMYP and Fauji Foundation are committed to fostering inclusive and sustainable youth development, supporting literacy, promoting arts and culture, and strengthening connections between youth and the corporate sector. The ultimate goal is to cultivate a generation of capable, responsible, and globally competitive young leaders who can positively represent Pakistan on national and international platforms. The signing ceremony was attended by senior officials from both organizations, including Brig Abid Hussain Shah SI(M) Retd, General Muhammad Ihsan HI(M) Retd, and Dr. Atta Ur Rehman from Fauji Foundation, and Chairman Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan and Dr. Muhammad Ali from PMYP. This historic partnership marks a major milestone in collaborative national efforts to unlock the full potential of Pakistan's youth and guide them toward a brighter future.",
