    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP): A high-level team from MCI and Capital Development Authority (CDA) conducted an inspection of the F-7 Markaz to initiate measures for its beautification and improvement on Tuesday. The delegation, comprising the Director of the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), Director Electrical, Director Sanitation, representatives from the Environment Department, CDA and the Assistant Commissioner City, held a meeting with elected representatives of the traders' association. Detailed discussions were held to formulate a joint strategy for enhancing the market's aesthetics and functionality. Key immediate actions include the repair and maintenance of streetlights, cleaning and construction of public restrooms, overall sanitation improvements, and the removal of unauthorized encroachments (with designated sitting areas to be strictly enforced). Additionally, phased tree trimming will be carried out to ensure clear visibility for shops and pathways. All identified issues will be addressed on a priority basis, with relevant departments held accountable for timely execution. The administration has pledged to extend such initiatives to other sectors and commercial centers across Islamabad, aligning with the CDA Chairman's vision of transforming the capital into a clean, beautiful, and citizen-friendly city.",
