    "article_body": "Taking part in the budget debate, Senator Khalida Ateeb emphasized the need for a comprehensive audit of the previous national budget, highlighting that although a new budget is prepared annually to manage the country's affairs, insufficient attention is given to learning from past financial experiences. She questioned whether lawmakers' recommendations would be incorporated into the upcoming fiscal document. Highlighting the economic significance of Karachi, the country's largest revenue-generating city, she called for equitable distribution of national resources. She proposed the establishment of a \"Karachi Urban Development Fund\" to ensure sustainable urban development in the metropolis. Senator Ateeb further stressed the importance of instituting a robust local government system across all provinces, including Balochistan, to devolve power at the grassroots level. \"Without empowering the local population, issues like sanitation and access to potable water will remain unresolved,\" she said. Referring to the ongoing K-IV water supply project critical to Karachi, she expressed concern over inadequate budgetary allocations and urged the government to prioritize the project for the benefit of the city's residents. The senator also criticized the imposition of taxes on solar panels and added that such measures could discourage the public from transitioning to renewable energy sources. \"We should be encouraging the shift towards solarization, not penalizing it,\" she noted. Commenting on the geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, she warned that rising international oil prices could have a direct impact on Pakistan's economy. Senator Ateeb also lauded the armed forces for the successful Operation Banyanum Marsoos, and added that \"We feel proud that our defense is in safe hands.\" Senator Bilal Ahmed Khan said that although the budget has not yet been finalized, its impact is already visible in market prices. He questioned when Pakistan would be able to formulate a budget without relying on loans, emphasizing the need for a serious discussion on unmet targets from previous years.

He said the shortage of drinking water in Balochistan was a sheer injustice and stressed the dire need for equitable development. Referring to the N-25 highway, he lamented that despite funds being allocated annually; the project remains incomplete and continues to claim nearly 10,000 lives each year. He raised objections to the FBR's point-of-sale system, questioning its practicality in areas lacking basic infrastructure like electricity and internet.
