    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP): Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi distributed financial assistance cheques Tuesday in a special ceremony held in Islamabad to the families of Railway Police Constables Muhammad Umar and Muhammad Waqas, who were martyred during an anti-encroachment operation in Mardan in 2024. While addressing the ceremony, the Federal Minister paid rich tribute to the martyrs and said, \"There is no price for a human life. Constables Muhammad Umar and Muhammad Waqas embraced martyrdom while performing their official duties-this is a sacrifice that can never be forgotten.\" He added that ever since assuming charge of the Ministry of Railways, his foremost priority has been to ensure the safety of railway personnel and to prevent such tragic incidents from recurring. \"Referring to this support as mere 'compensation' would not be appropriate. This is a symbolic gesture-real grief is borne by the families. We stand with them in this hour of sorrow.\" Minister Abbasi also cited the Jaffar Express incident, stating that prompt measures were taken for the victims and similar commitment will continue in safeguarding the rights and welfare of railway employees in the future. \"Pakistan Railways stands firmly with its employees. Providing them with basic facilities such as education, healthcare, and sanitation remains a top priority. We are committed to fostering a secure, dignified, and enabling work environment.\" In conclusion, Minister Abbasi personally addressed the families of the martyrs and said, \"You are our elders. Your presence here is an honor for us. Please feel free to reach out to me regarding any matter related to your martyred loved ones.\"",
