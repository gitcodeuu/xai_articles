    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP): Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch on Tuesday underscored that innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) must be guided by principle; human control and judgment must remain paramount. The Foreign Secretary inaugurated the Regional Consultations on Responsible AI in Military Domain (REAIM) here, a news release said. In her keynote remarks, the Foreign Secretary underlined, \"Military AI is transforming warfare, but legal and political frameworks are lagging behind. This transformation was unfolding in a deeply fragile international landscape and was lowering threshold for use of force. Ambassador Baloch pointed out that in South Asia, autonomous weapon capabilities were used for the first time in a nuclear environment and was compressing decision time during crises. She added that global governance must remain anchored in the UN system whereas REAIM offered a valuable complement. Developing States, she said needed capacity-building and regional dialogue to ensure inclusive rule-making. Some 17 States from West, Central and South Asia are participating in the two-day Regional Consultations of REAIM, being held in partnership with the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands and Spain.",
