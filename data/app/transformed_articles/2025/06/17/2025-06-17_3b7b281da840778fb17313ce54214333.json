    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP):Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), in collaboration with the Islamabad Police, conducted a rigorous vehicular emission testing drive on the busy Islamabad Expressway on Tuesday. The operation targeted vehicles entering the federal capital, a major transit route for heavy traffic, including goods carriers and passenger vehicles. A team from Pak-EPA's Environmental Monitoring Team (EMT) inspected emissions from 60 vehicles, issuing fines to 17 and warnings to 10 others for violating the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS). \"This campaign is part of our broader strategy to enforce environmental laws and reduce hazardous emissions,\" a Pak-EPA spokesperson told APP. \"Vehicles failing the test will face penalties, and repeat offenders may be taken off the road,\" he said. The Islamabad Expressway, a critical artery for the city's traffic, has seen worsening air quality due to unchecked emissions. Authorities warned that such operations would continue, urging motorists to ensure their vehicles comply with emission standards.",
