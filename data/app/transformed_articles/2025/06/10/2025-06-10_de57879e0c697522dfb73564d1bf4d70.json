    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Tuesday expressed optimism about federal budget for the next fiscal year would be relief-oriented. Talking to media informally before the cabinet meeting for approval of the budget 2025-26, he said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has always talked about providing relief to the people. To a question, he said that the opposition played a good role during the Indian aggression in the recent past. He said they should also adopt a constructive approach on economic issues. He said that he was disappointed over opposition's press conference yesterday. The minister said the opposition did not have economic data, so they were making personal attacks. \"They have nothing to criticize in the budget, so they are looking for various excuses\", Attaullah Tarar maintained. The minister recalled that the country was on the verge of default in 2022 but now due to prudent policies of the present regime, it witnessed economic stability. Tarar reminded that opposition leaders used to bet on Pakistan's default, but with the grace of Allah Almighty and untiring efforts of the government under leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, economy was stable all economic indicators have improved remarkably. He said inflation had decreased in Pakistan and overall growth had shown upward trend.",
