    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):Parliamentary Secretary, Farah Naz Akbar has hailed the budget as \"excellent\" and \"people-friendly,\" despite the country's challenging economic circumstances. Talking to the media outside the Parliament House, she said that the budget was presented under extremely difficult conditions, including the aftermath of the May 6 Pak-India war and International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions. Despite these pressures, she praised the government for delivering a \"remarkable\" budget that prioritizes public welfare. \"This budget is for the betterment of the country,\" she stated. \"As Pakistanis and as one nation, we must come together and make sacrifices for the stability of our nation. We must work collectively to steer Pakistan toward further progress.\" Samina Khalid Ghurki of Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has lauded the federal budget, calling it \"remarkable\" despite the country's limited financial resources. She highlighted key features of the budget, particularly the 10% increase in salaries for government employees, which she described as a \"commendable move.\" She also praised the simultaneous 7% increase in pensions, stating that it reflects the government's commitment to supporting retired workers and vulnerable segments of society. \"This is a very impressive budget presented under difficult circumstances,\" Ghurki said. \"If the public stands united and supports these measures, we will be able to achieve success and move the country forward.\"",
