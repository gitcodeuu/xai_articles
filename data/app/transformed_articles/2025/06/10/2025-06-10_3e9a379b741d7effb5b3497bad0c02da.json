    "article_body": "LONDON, Jun 10 (APP): The high-level Pakistani parliamentary delegation, led by Pakistan People's Party Chairman and former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, on Tuesday briefed the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Indian aggression and violations of Pakistan's sovereignty. During a meeting hosted by the APPG on Pakistan Chair Yasmin Qureshi MP, at Westminster Palace, which was attended by the cross-party British parliamentarians, Bilawal Bhutto categorically rejected the baseless Indian allegations leveled against Pakistan without any credible investigation or verifiable evidence. The delegation is a part of Pakistan's ongoing diplomatic outreach to the international community on the deteriorating regional security situation due to Indian aggression against Pakistan after the Pahalgam incident. The delegation head highlighted that the Indian attack on the civilian population, violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and unilateral holding in abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty - in blatant violation of International law and the modern rules-based system - could have dangerous consequences for the regional and international peace and security. Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Musadik Malik apprised the parliamentarians of the environmental hazards of holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance by India, threats to food security and survival of 240 million population of Pakistan, primarily an agrarian economy. The delegation emphasized that Pakistan's response to Indian aggression was calibrated, responsible and fully consistent with international law, including the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The delegation underscored Pakistan's commitment to restraint, revival of the Indus Waters Treaty and initiation of a composite dialogue between the two countries on all outstanding issues, particularly the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.",
