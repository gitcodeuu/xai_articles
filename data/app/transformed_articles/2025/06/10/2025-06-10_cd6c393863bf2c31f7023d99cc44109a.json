    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):The federal government, through its flagship social protection initiative of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), disbursed Rs. 592 billion in unconditional cash assistance to 9.9 million low-income families during the fiscal year 2024-25. This was shared during the budget speech for 2025-26 delivered by Finance Minister, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday. The financial support was aimed at helping economically disadvantaged households cope with rising inflation and income instability. The programme played a critical role in easing economic burdens through targeted cash transfers. Under the Benazir Nashonuma Programme, 1.5 million pregnant and lactating mothers were provided with essential nutrition, and 1.6 million children were supported with financial assistance and dietary supplements. Children under the age of two received additional focused care to address malnutrition and stunted growth. The government also awarded education stipends to 11.6 million children of BISP beneficiaries to encourage school enrollment and reduce dropout rates among disadvantaged families. To promote economic self-reliance, 250,000 individuals received financial literacy training, empowering them with the tools to manage their finances and participate in economic activity more effectively. These interventions reflect the government's ongoing commitment to supporting the most marginalized segments of society through a comprehensive and inclusive social protection system.",
