    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):The Embassy of the People's Republic of China on Tuesday organized an event on 'Global Civilization Initiative' to mark the International Day for Dialogue among Civilizations. Addressing the participants, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong has expressed deep admiration for the ancient Gandhara civilization, calling it a profound symbol of cultural fusion and a cornerstone of the enduring friendship between China and Pakistan. \"Gandhara is not only the pride of Pakistan but also a treasured chapter in the shared spiritual and artistic journey of our two nations,\" Ambassador Jiang said. \"The legacy of Gandharan monks and their role in transmitting peace thought across the Silk Road resonates deeply with the values of openness, mutual learning, and harmony that we champion today.\" He said studying Gandhara and Buddhism creates a historical and spiritual bond that continues to inspire cooperation today. The ambassador emphasized that cultural exchange remains essential in today's world and praised institutions working in China and Pakistan for their role in fostering mutual understanding. \"Let the artistry of Gandhara guide our path toward building a global community of shared values,\" he remarked. He said, \"Dialogue among civilizations fosters awareness of the universal values shared by all humankind. It promotes peaceful coexistence based on mutual respect and paves the way for joint solutions to the great challenges of our time.\" He urged to facilitate exchanges among civilizations, advocating for gaining insight through conversations between civilizations to tackle global issues and expand the options for global development. He said that the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI)- a diplomatic initiative of China complements the Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and serves to establish a multipolar world order and to seek progress for humanity and harmony for the entire world. He said that China and Pakistan have agreed to take the lead in implementing the GCI by enhancing civilizational exchanges and amity between their peoples. He added that China and Pakistan have also agreed to make joint efforts regarding GSI. Other speakers at the event focused on the urgent theme, \"The Imperative of Dialogue among Civilizations in a Changing World.\" They warned that as the world faces interconnected crises-ranging from conflict and inequality to mistrust and environmental degradation-dialogue remains the most effective tool to bridge divides and build peace. They described dialogue to eliminate prejudice, foster mutual understanding, and strengthen global cooperation. The International Day for Dialogue among Civilizations, they added, serves as a reminder of the importance of cultural diversity, inclusivity, and shared humanity in an increasingly polarized world. \"The world is celebrating the contribution of Chinese civilization to what the world is today, and we are also celebrating the diversity of humanity, and out of this diversity we make a beautiful tapestry and a beautiful mosaic of the world,\" speakers said. Speakers praised China for proposing the initiative, saying that dialogue among civilizations can help solve global challenges such as climate change, poverty, pandemics, conflicts and migration.",
