    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):Minister of State for Religious Affairs, Kesoo Mal Kheeal Das, on Tuesday welcomed the government's proposal to reduce taxes on salaried individuals, calling it a major relief measure. Speaking to APP, the minister said the proposed 10 percent salary increase in the budget for 2025-26 would also help ease the burden on the general public. He praised the government's initiative to support the construction sector, stating that it would stimulate several allied industries and contribute to overall economic activity. Highlighting key priorities, the minister said the government is committed to eliminating terrorism and strengthening the national economy. He added that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has consistently worked towards economic stability, and recent steps have helped the country avoid default. Criticising the opposition, he accused them of avoiding serious discussions on key national issues such as terrorism, the economy, and water, claiming their actions were driven by a desire to appease the PTI founder.",
