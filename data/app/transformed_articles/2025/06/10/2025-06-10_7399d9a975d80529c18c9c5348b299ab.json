    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):Federal Secretary, Ministry of Federal Education & Professional Training, Nadeem Mehbub, paid an official visit to the Inter Boards Coordination Commission (IBCC) Secretariat, where he received a comprehensive briefing on the Commission's operations, key functions, and recent reform initiatives. The presentation highlighted IBCC's digital shift, showcasing the improved online application system, complaint management interface, equivalence processing timelines, and reduction in pendency rates. Mr. Mehbub commended the institution's efforts to modernize service delivery and make attestation and equivalence procedures more accessible and student-centric. During his visit, the Executive Director IBCC, Dr. Ghulam Ali Mallah has given a briefing on the operational framework of IBCC, which covered key areas such as attestation and equivalence pendency, the annual number of equivalence applicants, processing timelines, the complaint management interface, public facilitation center and the online application system. The Secretary closely reviewed all the management system, and emphasized that student convenience must remain at the core of all reforms and encouraged further coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other departments to streamline procedural frameworks. Recognizing IBCC's transformation into a technology-driven body, Mr. Mehbub praised its initiatives in examination reforms, enhanced engagement with international boards, capacity-building programs, and co-curricular development. He also reviewed the Annual Performance Report and expressed satisfaction with its outcomes. Stressing the need for systemic change, Mr. Mehbub reiterated the urgency of implementing examination and assessment reforms, including the creation of a national question bank. He assured the Ministry's full support for executing decisions endorsed by the Forum of Chairmen and urged the Commission to leverage its platform for nationwide academic progress. He also endorsed IBCC's upcoming credit-based system, which aims to move students away from a marks-driven approach, fostering holistic academic development and reducing the unhealthy competition for top positions. The visit concluded with a reaffirmed commitment to innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement across all educational boards under the umbrella of IBCC.",
