    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP):Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) MNA Shahida Akhtar Ali on Tuesday said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)'s members disrupted the budget session instead of contributing useful suggestions to provide relief to the masses. Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House after the budget session for 2025-26, Shahida Akhtar Ali said that the way PTI protested in Parliament was not appropriate. She said PTI should have presented proposals to provide relief to the people in the fiscal budget. She said her party would present its formal stance and share suggestions aimed at helping the public. People did not vote for PTI to create disorder in the National Assembly, she added. They should participate in parliamentary proceedings instead of creating unrest. According to her, PTI members made noise during the session to target the government instead of offering constructive input for reforms. She also urged the government to provide maximum relief to the masses and hoped that the various positive initiatives by this government will provide relief to downtrodden segments of the country.",
