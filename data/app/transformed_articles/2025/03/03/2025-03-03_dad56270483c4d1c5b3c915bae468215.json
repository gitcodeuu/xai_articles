This initiative aims to promote Romanian culture and foster artistic exchange between the two nations. Renowned Romanian soprano and opera singer, Georgiana Costea-Gluga, will conduct the sessions twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM at the PNCA premises in F-5/1, Islamabad. The courses are open to individuals aged 14 and above, with participants under 14 focusing on basic technique elements.
