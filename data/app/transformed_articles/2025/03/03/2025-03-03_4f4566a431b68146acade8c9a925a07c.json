The inauguration ceremony was jointly presided over by Federal Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to Pakistan, Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki. Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki emphasized that the Iftar and dates distribution initiative is part of a series of humanitarian projects launched under the directives of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud during the holy month of Ramadan.
