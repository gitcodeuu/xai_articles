He praised the security forces for successfully thwarting the attack and commended their bravery. Ayaz Sadiq emphasized that the nation takes great pride in its armed forces, which are countering enemy threats on all fronts. He further asserted that anti-state elements will never succeed in their nefarious designs, and security forces, along with law enforcement agencies, are determined to eliminate such threats with full force.
