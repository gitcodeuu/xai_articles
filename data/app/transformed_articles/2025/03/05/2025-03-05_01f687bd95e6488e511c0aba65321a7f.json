    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 05 (APP):Senator Irfan Siddiqui, a senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and the parliamentary party leader in the Senate, visited Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak on Wednesday to offer his condolences and recite Fatiha for the martyrdom of Maulana Hamid ul Haq. During his visit, Senator Siddiqui met with Maulana Abdul Haq II, the son of the late Maulana Hamid ul Haq, and expressed his heartfelt sympathies, said a press release on Wednesday. The gathering was also attended by Maulana Rashid ul Haq Sami, deputy administrator of Darul Uloom Haqqania, along with other prominent leaders of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S). Senator Siddiqui described the martyrdom of Maulana Hamid ul Haq as a profound loss for the nation, praising his exceptional leadership in steering the affairs of Darul Uloom following the martyrdom of his father, Maulana Sami ul Haq. He also commended Maulana Hamid ul Haq's efforts in maintaining the active role of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S) in national politics. Reflecting on his longstanding association with Darul Uloom Haqqania, Senator Siddiqui condemned the terrorist attack on the seminary and the targeted killing of Maulana Hamid ul Haq. He called for national unity in the fight against terrorism, stating, \"The attack on Darul Uloom Haqqania and the martyrdom of Maulana Hamid ul Haq serve as a stark reminder that we must stand united to eradicate terrorism from its roots. The government is fully cognizant of its national responsibility, and InshaAllah, the blood of Maulana Hamid ul Haq will not be shed in vain.\" Before concluding his visit, Senator Siddiqui penned his thoughts in the condolence book, paying tribute to the late Maulana Hamid ul Haq.",
