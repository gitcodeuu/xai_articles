Expressing strong displeasure, the Deputy Speaker said it was unacceptable that ministers failed to attend the session despite clear instructions from the Prime Minister. He said that the ministers were not taking their responsibilities seriously, which was unfortunate. The House was adjourned until tomorrow (Friday) at 11:30 a.m.",
