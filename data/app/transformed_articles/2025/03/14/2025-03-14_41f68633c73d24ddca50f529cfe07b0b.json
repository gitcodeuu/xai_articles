    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 13 (APP):Federal Minister for Communications, Abdul Aleem Khan while presiding over a high-level meeting of the National Highway Authority (NHA) gave a two-month deadline to the Members and senior officers of the department, urging them to change their approach and bring improvement in their performance. He emphasized that delays will not be tolerated and any officer failing to perform up to the mark will be sent home. Federal Minister expressed his displeasure with the output of the NHA and directed all Members to ensure transparency in developmental projects, said a press release issued on Thursday. He stressed that the timely completion of road construction projects should be top priority for the NHA as delays significantly increase their costs.
