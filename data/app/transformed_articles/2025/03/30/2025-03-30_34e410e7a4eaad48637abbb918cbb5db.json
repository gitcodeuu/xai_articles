    "article_body": "LAHORE, Mar 30 (APP):Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif held a telephonic conversation with President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev on auspicious occasion of Eidul-Fitr, and reaffirmed the strong fraternal ties between the two nations. During the call, PM Shehbaz extended heartfelt Eid greetings to President Aliyev, his family, and the people of Azerbaijan. He expressed his best wishes for their continued peace, prosperity, and well-being. Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations. Building upon the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's recent visit to Baku, they agreed on enhancing economic cooperation. It was confirmed that Azerbaijan's Minister of Economy would visit Islamabad in the first week of April to hold discussions with Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister and also meet Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The visit aims to finalise key investment agreements, paving the way for President Ilham Aliyev's anticipated visit to Pakistan later in April. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasised that President Aliyev's upcoming visit would mark a significant milestone in Pakistan-Azerbaijan relations. Both sides are expected to sign investment agreements worth US$2 billion, signifying a new era of strategic partnership and economic collaboration between the two countries. The strengthening of ties between Pakistan and Azerbaijan is expected to bring mutual economic benefits and further consolidate diplomatic relations between the two brotherly nations.",
