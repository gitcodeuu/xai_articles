    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 06 (APP):Jazz, Pakistan's leading digital conglomerate, has partnered with Huawei to deploy solar power at 1,000 telecom sites nationwide. This initiative, powered by Huawei's iSolar technology, will significantly enhance Jazz's transition to a sustainable telecom network by integrating renewable energy solutions. The solarization of these sites, expected to be completed in the coming months, will generate approximately 15,000 MWh of green energy annually. This aligns with Jazz's long-term commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Aamir Ibrahim, CEO of Jazz, stated: \"We are dedicated to delivering an ideal experience for our customers while mitigating our environmental footprint. The deployment of iSolar sites takes us further in our sustainability journey, enabling us to provide reliable connectivity powered by renewable energy to our customers. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to taking the steps that are good for business and the planet, contributing to responsible use of energy resources in Pakistan.\" Steven Yi, President, Joint Chiefs of Staff for All Regions, Huawei, added: \"We are very pleased to work with Jazz to create a global green industry benchmark, continue to reduce operator Opex, drive Pakistan and the entire communications industry to go green, and deliver on Veon's green strategy.\" Beyond its immediate environmental and operational benefits, the successful deployment of iSolar sites is expected to serve as a scalable model for future expansion. As the project advances in 2025, Jazz and Huawei remain committed to integrating innovative technologies that drive sustainability and contribute to a low-carbon digital future.",
