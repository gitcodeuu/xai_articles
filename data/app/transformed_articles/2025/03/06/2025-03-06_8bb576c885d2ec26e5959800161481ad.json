    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 06 (APP):Senator Sherry Rehman on Thursday called for a detailed briefing by relevant officials and the allocation of specific days for a comprehensive debate on terrorism. Speaking on the Senate floor, she urged the House to address the issue with utmost seriousness and said that terrorism is a collective concern and responsibility. She stressed the need to pass a resolution that not only identifies the root causes of terrorism but also proposes concrete solutions. \"We are lawmakers, and we must deliberate on this pressing issue. If necessary, an in-camera briefing can be arranged, but we must not remain mere spectators. People should not question whether we are only here to discuss our privileges and vote on benefits-we must take decisive action,\" she said. She expressed deep concern over the resurgence of terrorism, calling it a critical issue requiring immediate attention. Referring to the recent terrorist attack in Bannu, she said,\"Today, we have prayed for the martyrs, but we must go beyond prayers. We need a briefing, a debate, and a resolution-these three steps are essential.\" She also urged the House to ensure full attendance during discussions and suggested that the issue be taken up in a joint sitting of Parliament for a more unified approach.",
