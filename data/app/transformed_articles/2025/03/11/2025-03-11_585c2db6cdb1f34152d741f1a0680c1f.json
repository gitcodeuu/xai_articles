Additional District and Sessions Judge Adnan Rasool Lark approved the bail. The case was registered at Margalla Police Station, with charges of assault, harassment, and snatching cash and gold. During the hearing, the complainant, Hajra Khattak, along with witnesses Kainat Khattak and Malaika Khattak, appeared in court. They informed the judge that the incident was a misunderstanding and that they had no interest in pursuing the case against the accused. The complainant submitted a written statement and a notarized affidavit, confirming that they did not object to the bail. Following this, the court granted bail against surety bonds of Rs. 10,000.
