    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 11 (APP):The literary organization Qalam Karwan has organized an insightful online session on 'Muakhat-e-Madina' under the banner of the global literary circle Seerat-un-Nabi(SAWW). The event, held online, attracted participants from across Pakistan and beyond, fostering an international dialogue on the life and teachings of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The session was presided over by Dr Khalid Madni, Head of the Islamic Studies Department at Government Postgraduate College, Sargodha. The keynote speaker, Dr Ayesha Jadoon, Head of the Department of Islamic Studies at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, delivered a thought-provoking address on 'Muakhat-e-Madina'(The Bond of Brotherhood in Madina). In her speech, Dr Jadoon highlighted the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) historic initiative of establishing brotherhood between the Muhajireen (migrants) and the Ansar (hosts) of Madina. She explained how the displaced and destitute migrants found themselves in a new city, yet through the divine wisdom of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), they were paired with local residents who welcomed them with open arms. She further emphasized that instead of becoming a burden on their hosts, the Muhajireen took an active role in the economy, engaging in trade and business, which ultimately contributed to the overall prosperity of the community. This remarkable event in history stands as an exemplary model of unity and solidarity. The session concluded with Dr Khalid Madni's closing remarks, appreciating the speakers and the participation of attendees from various parts of the world.",
