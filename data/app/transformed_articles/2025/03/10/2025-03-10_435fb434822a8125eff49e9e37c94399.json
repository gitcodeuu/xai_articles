    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 10 (APP):Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Information Secretary and Member of the National Assembly, Shazia Marri, on Monday termed President Asif Ali Zardari's address to the joint sitting of Parliament as historic. Talking to media outside the parliament, she said the President, in his speech, underscored democratic values, inclusive development, and a balanced foreign policy. \"The address outlined a comprehensive vision for economic recovery, political stability, regional equality, and enhanced security,\" Marri remarked. She said that President Zardari emphasized the need for national unity and collective efforts, urging the government to adopt a consultative approach by incorporating the views of all stakeholders in governance. Highlighting key points from the President's address, Marri said he called on Parliament to rise above personal and political differences in the greater national interest. \"He advocated reducing the tax burden on salaried individuals, increasing wages, and lowering energy costs to provide relief to the common man,\" she added. Marri also pointed out that special attention was directed toward the development and integration of Gilgit-Baltistan and Balochistan into the national development framework. She said President Zardari lauded the sacrifices of the country's security forces in the fight against terrorism and reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve to eliminate the menace. \"The President stressed the importance of cooperation among institutions, provinces, and political parties to ensure national progress,\" she said. Commenting on the conduct of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers during the session, she criticized their behavior as \"unparliamentary and disruptive.\" \"It appears PTI has no concern for the country or its challenges. Their one-point agenda is to spread chaos and divide the nation,\" she alleged.",
