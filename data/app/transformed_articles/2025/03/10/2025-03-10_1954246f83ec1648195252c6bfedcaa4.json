    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 10 (APP):Capital Development Authority (CDA) in a unique approach, planned to use helicopter for spraying and seed-dropping in the Margalla Hills to promote plantation in hard-to-reach areas. It was decided in a meeting presided over by Chairman Randhawa here on Monday, attended by environmental expert Rizwan Mahboob, members of the Baku environmental team, and senior officers from the CDA's Environment Wing. The meeting also decided to launch a comprehensive campaign to remove paper mulberry trees and replace them with environmentally friendly plants. The initiative, spearheaded by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, aims to address the growing concerns over pollen allergies caused by paper mulberry trees while promoting a sustainable urban environment. During the meeting, Randhawa emphasized the importance of the initiative, stating, \"Planting environment-friendly trees is a continuous charity. We believe in a Green Islamabad and a Green Pakistan, and no effort will be spared to achieve this vision.\" The campaign has already seen significant progress, with 5,072 paper mulberry trees removed from F-9 Park and replaced with 10,000 new trees. The CDA plans to plant approximately 30,000 eco-friendly plants in F-9 Park during the spring season. Similarly, in the Shakarparian area, 10,000 paper mulberry trees will be removed, and 50,000 new plants will be planted. Along the slopes of drains and roads, 1,000 paper mulberry trees will be replaced with 80,000 local, eco-friendly plants. Across other sectors of Islamabad, an additional 10,000 paper mulberry trees will be removed, with 50,000 new plants taking their place. The CDA has also decided to involve the private and corporate sectors in this year's plantation campaign. Chairman Randhawa directed that fruit-bearing, shade-providing, and flowering trees be prioritized to enhance the city's greenery and biodiversity. He also called for the participation of students, teachers, and staff from both private and public educational institutions to ensure the campaign's success. Additionally, private housing societies will be encouraged to participate in the campaign, and plant stalls will be set up in low-price markets established under the Ramadan Relief Package to engage the public. To raise awareness, the CDA will display a list of suitable plants and trees for the local environment on its website. Chairman Randhawa also emphasized the role of media in promoting the campaign, urging various outlets to spread the message of environmental conservation. In a symbolic gesture, the CDA has committed to ensuring that each of its 15,000 officers and employees plants at least one eco-friendly tree. \"We believe in taking practical steps,\" said Randhawa, highlighting the authority's dedication to leading by example.",
