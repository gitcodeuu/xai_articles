    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 10 (APP):The Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) has made significant strides in transforming Pakistan's research and innovation landscape, driving economic growth, and strengthening global collaborations. Since February 2024, the ministry has implemented groundbreaking reforms, resulting in billion-dollar import substitutions, enhanced exports, and improved governance. According to an official source, the ministry's demand-driven research and industry collaboration contributed to a $1 billion increase in exports and significant foreign exchange savings, in a major boost to Pakistan's economy. The ministry facilitated $166 million in citrus exports, conducted crucial environmental research on seawater intrusion, and deployed AI technology in crime prevention, demonstrating its commitment to science-backed solutions for national progress. Organizational restructuring played a key role in improving efficiency, with several inefficient entities reformed or recommended for closure. The ministry actively supported over 1,000 industry clients, ensuring Pakistan's industries benefited from cutting-edge research and technological advancements. Recognizing the importance of international collaborations, the ministry signed 12 global agreements, fostering knowledge exchange and technological partnerships. The establishment of 120 new startups has further positioned Pakistan as an emerging hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. The efforts to streamline trade and industrial standards have been a major focus, with Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) integrating into Pakistan Single Window for smoother trade facilitation. Meanwhile, Pakistan National Accreditation Council (PNAC) developed 300 new standards and enhanced risk management systems for imports, ensuring better compliance and product quality. Public engagement and education have been central to MoST's initiatives, with science awareness programs reaching a record number of participants. More than 52,994 students and 97,365 members of the general public visited the Pakistan Museum of Natural History. 93,437 individuals participated in Science Caravan Exhibitions, while 3,500 scientists, students, and professionals were actively involved in World Science Day celebrations. In efforts to build the next generation of engineers and scientists, the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) conducted crash courses and seminars, training 450 engineers in professional skill development. All science and technology organizations introduced skilled-based internship programs, ensuring young professionals gain hands-on experience in emerging fields. MoST's reforms have led to better governance, transparency, and institutional efficiency. Reviving inactive organizations and ensuring merit-based recruitment have strengthened Pakistan's research and development (R&D) ecosystem. The implementation of the Integrated Risk Management System for Import Inspections with Pakistan Single Window has further streamlined trade regulations, making business operations smoother. These reforms have resulted in greater economic self-reliance, stronger diplomatic ties, and an improved business environment. New policies have enhanced product quality control, trade facilitation, and compliance, ensuring Pakistan meets global standards in various industries. The ministry's initiatives have received high praise from experts and industry stakeholders. Engr Dr Waseem Ashraf, HoD Electronics Engineering at GCU Lahore, commended PEC's Generative AI Training, describing it as \"highly impactful and a crucial step in equipping engineers with future-ready skills.\" Meanwhile, Pakistan Halal Authority's digital transformation through ERP implementation has been termed a \"game-changer for the Halal export industry in Pakistan,\" highlighting its role in boosting the country's global competitiveness. With a vision to position Pakistan as a leader in research, innovation, and technological development, the Ministry of Science and Technology remains committed to driving economic growth and strengthening global partnerships. As the country continues to make strides in AI, industrial standards, and scientific research, MoST's efforts signal a new era of progress and self-reliance for Pakistan's science and technology sector.",
