The attempt to enter the post was effectively thwarted by own troops, which forced the khawarij to ram an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall,\" said an ISPR news release. Own troops fought bravely, effectively engaged the assailant, and after an intense fire exchange all ten khawarij including a suicide bomber were sent to hell, outside the perimeter wall of the post.
