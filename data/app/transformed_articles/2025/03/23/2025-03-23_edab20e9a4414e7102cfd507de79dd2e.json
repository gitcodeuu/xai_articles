After an intense fire exchange, all sixteen Khwarij were sent to hell\" the release said. Pakistan has consistently been asking the Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border. The interim Afghan Government is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij for perpetuating acts of terrorism against Pakistan. The security forces of Pakistan are determined and remain committed to securing its borders and eliminating the menace of terrorism from the country.",
