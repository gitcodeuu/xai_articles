    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 08 (APP): This International Women's Day, Daraz Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to creating a world where women and girls have equal rights, opportunities, and the empowerment they deserve. An equitable future is one where no one is left behind, and it is up to society to make it a reality. Under this year's theme, \"For All Women and Girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment,\" Daraz Pakistan honors the remarkable contributions of women in all aspects of life, celebrating their roles as leaders, caregivers, nurturers, and changemakers. The company emphasizes the importance of striving for a world where all women and girls have access to equal opportunities and the ability to shape their own futures. At the core of this vision is the empowerment of the next generation-young women and adolescent girls-who hold the potential to drive transformative change in society. Across industries, countless women are breaking the glass ceiling and challenging stereotypes, proving that no field is beyond their reach. Two remarkable women, Saadia Siddiqui and Amina Sohail, exemplify the spirit of this year's International Women's Day theme. Their journeys highlight the importance of opportunities, resilience, and support in empowering women to thrive in traditionally male-dominated fields. Saadia Siddiqui, a station manager at Daraz Pakistan, has always been passionate about supply chain and logistics. However, like many women in such industries, she faced challenges in finding opportunities to advance her career. When Daraz opened a position for a station officer, Saadia seized the chance to align her expertise with her ambitions. Drawing on her knowledge of operations and logistics, she transitioned from a recovery officer in real estate to a key player in Daraz's logistics network. Since joining Daraz in 2021, Saadia has found an environment that fosters growth, inclusivity, and learning. Encouraged by her positive experiences, she now aspires to pursue a formal degree in supply chain management to further explore and specialize in the field. \"I have always wanted to grow in this field, and Daraz gave me the opportunity to do just that. The support and encouragement I received here made me realize that there are no limits to what women can achieve in logistics,\" she shares. Her story underscores the significance of workplace support and educational growth in empowering women to excel in their chosen careers. Another inspiring story is that of Amina Sohail, a DEX Hero at Daraz. Amina has always enjoyed exploring new places and meeting different people. When she discovered the opportunity to work as a rider, she saw it as a chance to turn her passion into a profession. As the only female rider in the South region, Amina has navigated an environment that is predominantly male. Yet, she has never let that deter her. She receives immense support and encouragement from her team and colleagues, which has helped her thrive in her role. Amina also acknowledges the unwavering support of her family, which has been crucial in her journey. \"I always wanted to do something different, and Daraz gave me that opportunity. Women must be strong, take advantage of the chances they get, and never limit themselves,\" she says. Her advice to other women is clear: be strong, seize available opportunities, and refuse to set self-imposed limitations. Amina's story is a testament to how resilience and community support can help women succeed in any field. These stories challenge the long-standing stereotypes that restrict women to certain professions. Often, women are told that fields such as logistics, transportation, and operations are not meant for them. However, Saadia and Amina's journeys prove otherwise. As of 2023, women held 26% of C-level positions in the supply chain sector, up from 15% in 2022. The notion that women do not get opportunities in male-dominated industries is a misconception. Organizations like Daraz Pakistan are actively working to change this narrative by providing women with equal opportunities to grow and succeed. Women face challenges in the workplace, but none are insurmountable. With the right support, resources, and mindset, they can overcome obstacles and thrive in any field. Daraz Pakistan continues to champion this cause, ensuring that every woman and girl has the opportunity to achieve their full potential.",
