Stressing the critical role of young people in driving the digital revolution and advancing technology in the country, he reaffirmed the government's commitment to equip young individuals with modern skills. During the meeting, the PM stated that the government was providing all possible support to ensure youth were prepared for the evolving digital landscape. He highlighted that Huawei's ICT training programme would not only enhance IT exports but also create employment opportunities for young professionals. A delegation from Huawei Technologies attended the meeting, where various initiatives aimed at imparting digital skills and providing world-class IT training were discussed.
