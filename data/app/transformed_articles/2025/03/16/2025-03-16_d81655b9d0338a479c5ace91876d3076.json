    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 16 (APP):Pakistan's aviation sector is reaching new heights as the Ministry of Aviation unveils major reforms, infrastructure development, and international breakthroughs aimed at enhancing air transport services and aligning with global standards. A key milestone is the lifting of the ban on Pakistani air carriers operating in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom, opening new revenue streams and enabling direct, cost-effective flights for passengers traveling to Europe, says the one year performance document released by the government of Pakistan at the completion of one year term. This marks a major comeback for Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL), which reported a profit of Rs. 7.6 billion in 2024, doubling its earnings from the previous year. Another highlight is the inauguration of Gwadar International Airport (NGIA) in January 2025, a crucial project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The airport's 12,000-foot runway can accommodate wide-body aircraft, boosting passenger capacity, trade, and regional connectivity, with an expected 10% annual increase in passenger traffic and 30,000 metric tons of cargo handling annually. Additionally, the separation of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA), and Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) aligns Pakistan with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations, strengthening oversight and transparency. In meteorological advancements, the launch of the Hydromet Services of PMD in Pakistan (MHSP) project, funded by the World Bank, is set to revolutionize weather forecasting. The installation of 300 automatic weather stations, five weather radars, and a high-performance computing system will enhance climate monitoring and disaster preparedness. With a focus on safety, efficiency, and modernization, these initiatives not only improve global connectivity but also make PIACL's privatization more attractive to investors by separating its liabilities into a newly formed holding company. As Pakistan takes bold strides towards a more resilient and globally integrated aviation sector, these accomplishments promise greater investment, improved services, and a brighter future for air travel in the region.",
