    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 01 (APP):The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed a polio case from District Thatta, Sindh. This is the fourth polio case from Sindh and the sixth case from Pakistan at large this year. Last year in 2024, a total of 74 cases were reported. Of these, 27 were from Balochistan, 23 from Sindh, 22 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five is essential to provide children high immunity against this terrible disease. The Polio Programme is implementing a rigorous vaccination schedule to protect children from paralytic polio and interrupt virus transmission. The first nationwide polio campaign of 2025 reached over 45 million children with the vaccine earlier this month, while a fIPV-OPV campaign in Quetta Division and Karachi was held between 20 and 28 February vaccinating around 0.9 million children with the injectable and oral polio vaccines for an added immunity boost. This campaign is aligned with the Big Catch-Up also being implemented nationwide by the Expanded Programme on Immunization to immunize missed or under-vaccinated children against 12 preventable childhood diseases. Moreover, a targeted vaccination activity in 104 union councils bordering Afghanistan or having Afghan refugee camps or populations was also held this week to reduce the risk of cross-border and internal poliovirus transmission, vaccinating over 0.6 million children. The Polio Programme urged all parents to get their children vaccinated against polio at every opportunity to keep them protected from this devastating disease.",
