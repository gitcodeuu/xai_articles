    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 18 (APP):The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has launched Phase-II, Batch-VI of the Interim Placement of Fresh PhDs (IPFP) program. This initiative aims to provide recent PhD graduates with academic experience and mentorship opportunities before they formally enter the academic job market. The program will place fresh PhDs in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and postgraduate government colleges for a one-year tenure. Selected candidates will receive a fixed remuneration package of Rs. 150,000 per month for 12 months. As per eligibility criteria, applicants must meet specific requirements to qualify for the program. They must be Pakistani or AJK nationals under the age of 40 at the time of application. A PhD degree from an HEC-recognized university, either Pakistani or foreign, completed within the last two years is mandatory. Additionally, applicants should have at least two research publications in HEC-recognized or indexed journals. They must also be unemployed at the time of application, with those working in temporary or contractual positions required to resign if selected. The IPFP program follows a structured process to ensure proper placement and training. HEC will circulate a list of successful candidates to HEIs, allowing institutions to select candidates based on their needs. Selected candidates must complete four weeks of mandatory training under the National Faculty Development Program (NFDP), led by renowned trainers. Upon successful training completion, candidates will be placed at HEIs for one year as IPFP. Interested applicants must submit their applications online via the HEC e-portal by April 15, 2025, at 4:00 PM. A non-refundable application fee of Rs. 3,000 must be deposited in Habib Bank Limited (HEC Account Number: 1742-79001334-01). Hard copies of the application form and required documents should be sent to the designated HEC office. A pre-assessment test will be conducted on Sunday, May 11, 2025, and candidates scoring 50% or above will qualify for NFDP training. Successful completion of NFDP training is mandatory before placement as an IPFP Fellow in an HEI. This initiative aims to help fresh PhD graduates gain valuable academic exposure and enhance their prospects in the higher education sector.",
