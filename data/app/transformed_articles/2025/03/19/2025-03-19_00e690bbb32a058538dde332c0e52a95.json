    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 19 (APP):The Parliamentary Party Leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in the Senate and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator Irfan Siddiqui, has criticized the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's boycott of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, calling it consistent with PTI's political approach. In a statement shared on his social media account 'X' on Wednesday, the senior PML-N leader stated that it was only PTI that could prioritize meeting with a convicted prisoner over formulating a strategy to combat terrorism, a threat that has claimed the lives of 93,000 Pakistanis. Senator Siddiqui further emphasized that this was the same individual, a former Prime Minister, who, during his tenure, had never attended any parliamentary forum focused on national security.",
