In a statement on the social media platform aXa , he stated that PTIas decision to boycott the committee aligns with its usual political approach. He accused the party of prioritizing a meeting with a convicted prisoner over devising strategies to combat terrorism, which has claimed the lives of 93,000 Pakistanis. Siddiqui further criticized the imprisoned leader, saying that even during his tenure as Prime Minister, he never participated in any parliamentary forums related to national security.",
