    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 19 (APP):The Supreme Court has sought response from provincial governments regarding the mandatory teaching of the Holy Quran. The five-member Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard the petition, in which the federal government, as well as the governments of Punjab and Balochistan, submitted their responses to the court. The governments of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, however, requested additional time to submit their replies. During the hearing, Justice Jamal Mandokhail remarked that the federal government had already initiated measures regarding Quranic education, so let the government do its work, and there was no need for court intervention. The petitioner's lawyer, Aniq Khatana, argued that if the governments were actually working on the matter, they wouldn't have been coming to the courts for the past five years. He further stated that federal approval is necessary for the translation of the Holy Quran.",
