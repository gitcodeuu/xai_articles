The foreign remittances during December 2024 increased to US$3.1 billion against November 2024, posting month-on-month growth of 5.6%. In a press statement, the prime minister said the remittances witnessed a record growth of 29.3% in December 2024 against same month (December 2023) of last year. \"Record increase in the foreign remittances reflects the strong commitment of the overseas Pakistanis for playing their role in development of the country,\" the prime minister said. After achieving economic stability, Pakistan is now on the path of economic growth, the prime minister said adding that the government was determined to ensure national development and public welfare.",
