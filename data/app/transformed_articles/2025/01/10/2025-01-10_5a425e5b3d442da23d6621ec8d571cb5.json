    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 10 (APP):The Overseas Employment Corporation (OEC) under the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (MOPHRD) here on Friday hosted a landmark event celebrating the launch of the IT & Japanese Language Internship Program in collaboration with Plus W Inc., Japan. The event marked a significant step forward in OEC's mission to promote emigration opportunities and facilitate workforce placements in global markets, said a press release. The program, themed \"Bridging Cultures and Careers - Empowering IT Graduates through Japanese Language and Advanced IT Training Opportunities in Japan,\" aims to align Pakistan's youth with international employment demands. The initiative focuses on equipping IT graduates with advanced skills in data science and cloud technologies while also preparing them in Japanese language proficiency (JLPT N5 & N4) for seamless integration into the Japanese workforce. Federal Minister, MOPHRD Chaudhry Salik Hussain emphasized the importance of such initiatives in showcasing Pakistan's IT potential to the global market. He remarked that the IT sector is the backbone of modern economies and that Pakistan, with its talented youth, is well-positioned to contribute globally. The minister also highlighted the critical role of Japanese language skills in bridging cultural and linguistic barriers, enabling Pakistani professionals to excel in international markets. He lauded the collaboration with Plus W as a beacon of mutual progress, reiterating the Ministry's commitment for increasing foreign employment opportunities for Pakistanis to bolster remittances and strengthen the national economy. Managing Director, OEC Naseer Khan Kashani expressed pride in OEC's efforts to integrate general education graduates into structured migration streams. Highlighting the collaboration with 15 universities, he emphasized that this inaugural batch of 54 IT professionals represents the beginning of a journey that will expand to 4,000 professionals within the next year. He underscored OEC's strategic focus on bridging gaps in talent alignment and fostering international collaboration for sustainable workforce development. Federal Secretary, MOPHRD, Dr. Arshad Mahmood detailed the Ministry's broader vision to enable Pakistan's workforce to compete on the global stage. He acknowledged the transformative potential of this program, which aligns seamlessly with the Ministry's goals of enhancing skill development, streamlining migration processes, and fostering bilateral partnerships. He highlighted the strategic alignment between stakeholders, including universities, foreign employers, and training partners, as key in addressing global workforce needs. Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan Shuichi Akamatsu emphasized the historical ties between Pakistan and Japan, tracing them back to the 1950s when Pakistan supported Japan's postwar recovery. He noted that Japan's aging population and declining workforce present an opportunity for Pakistan to export its IT talent, creating a win-win situation for both nations. He reaffirmed Japan's commitment in deepening bilateral collaboration through such programs, which reflect a long-standing spirit of mutual support. Founder & CEO, Plus W Inc. Japan, Wakako Sakurai highlighted Plus W's dedication in bridging the gap between Pakistani IT talent and Japanese organizations. She expressed optimism that this program would equip Pakistani professionals with the technical and linguistic skills needed to excel in Japan's workforce, strengthening ties between the two nations and addressing Japan's skilled labor shortage. Executive Vice President & COO, Plus W Inc. Japan, Takashi Horiuchi provided an overview of the program, which will train IT students from top Pakistani universities in advanced IT skills and Japanese language proficiency. He emphasized the focus on practical, real-world IT development projects and IT-specific Japanese language training to prepare participants for impactful roles in Japanese companies. The event concluded on a high note, with all speakers acknowledging the immense potential of this initiative to transform Pakistan's workforce and contribute to Japan's economic needs. This program exemplifies OEC's efforts in emigration promotion, opening new avenues for skilled workers and fostering bilateral partnerships. As a pioneering project, it sets the stage for many such initiatives that will not only enhance employment opportunities for Pakistanis but also strengthen economic ties with partner countries.",
