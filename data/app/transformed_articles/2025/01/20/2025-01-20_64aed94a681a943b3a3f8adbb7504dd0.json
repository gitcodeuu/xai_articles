    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 20 (APP):The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday restored the membership of 26 parliamentarians after they submitted their statements of assets and liabilities. An ECP official confirmed that the restored memberships included five members of the National Assembly, 14 members of the Punjab Assembly, three members of the Sindh Assembly, and four members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. These parliamentarians had previously faced suspension for failing to submit annual asset and liability statements for themselves, their spouses, and dependents. The ECP's move follows compliance by the affected members with the required declarations, allowing for the restoration of their parliamentary status.",
