    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 20 (APP):Speaker of the National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday adjourned the House proceedings until Tuesday at 2:00 PM due to a lack of quorum. During the Question Hour, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) member Mehboob Shah raised the issue of quorum while State Minister for Finance and Revenue, Ali Pervaiz Malik, was responding to a question posed by MNA Asia Naz Tanoli. Ayaz Sadiq immediately called for a headcount, and upon confirming insufficient attendance, he said, \"The House is not in order,\" and temporarily adjourned the session until the quorum was met. However, upon reconvening the session after a short break, the Speaker asked again for headcount and found the quorum still was incomplete. Consequently, he adjourned the proceedings until Tuesday, January 21, at 2:00 PM.",
