    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 20 (APP):Jazz, Pakistan's leading digital operator, has introduced affordable UAE Data Roaming Bundles, providing seamless connectivity for Pakistani travelers and the diaspora in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to a news release these bundles eliminate the need for expensive foreign SIMs or complex eSIM setups, offering high-speed data at competitive rates to ensure a hassle-free travel experience. The bundles come in three convenient options: 1 GB for 7 days at Rs 999, 2 GB for 15 days at Rs 1799, and 5 GB for 30 days at Rs 4499. A standout feature is the unrestricted access to VoIP audio and video calling services like WhatsApp, BiP, Messenger, and FaceTime, addressing a common challenge for users of local UAE SIMs. Customers can easily activate these bundles by dialing *7626#, through the Jazz SIMOSA app, or via Jazz's WhatsApp self-service here. Adeel Asad, Head of Carrier & International Business at Jazz, remarked, \"These new UAE Data Roaming Bundles reflect our ongoing commitment to meeting the evolving needs of our customers. By leveraging partnerships with leading UAE networks like Etisalat, we are able to offer affordable, reliable, and high-quality connectivity that ensures our customers stay connected with their loved ones and work seamlessly, no matter where they are.\" These new data bundles complement Jazz's extensive roaming portfolio, which includes World Bundles covering over 90 countries and Saudi Bundles for data services in Saudi Arabia. Customers can also access voice and SMS services in the UAE at base tariffs, with details available here. With these affordable solutions, Jazz continues to provide smooth connectivity for its customers, whether traveling for Hajj, leisure, or business.",
