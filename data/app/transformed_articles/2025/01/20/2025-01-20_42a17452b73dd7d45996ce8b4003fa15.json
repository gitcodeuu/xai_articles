    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 20 (APP):Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) took action against non-compliance with environmental regulations at Centaurus Mall, confiscating all prohibited plastic items on-site, and shops found in violation were sealed immediately. The Director General Pak-EPA, along with her team, conducted a visit to The Centaurus Mall to assess compliance with environmental regulations. During the inspection, significant violations were observed, including the use of single-use plastics by several brands and food outlets, despite their ban in the capital city, an EPA official told APP on Monday. He said the inspection at the Centaurus Mall uncovered major environmental non-compliance issues. Key findings included the absence of indoor air quality and vehicle emission reports, generators emitting black smoke, and failure to display Pak-EPA-provided compliance banners. The official noted that waste segregation was not practiced, and waste disposal data was inaccurate, with reports of dumping at non-CDA-approved sites. Additionally, he said the lack of qualified environmental professionals in the management team raised serious concerns about their capacity to adhere to environmental standards. The DG Pak-EPA emphasized the importance of adhering to environmental regulations to mitigate pollution and safeguard public health. She directed immediate corrective measures to address the highlighted issues and warned of stringent actions against continued non-compliance. Pak-EPA remains committed to enforcing environmental laws to create a sustainable and Eco-friendly Islamabad.Businesses and individuals are urged to comply with regulations and actively contribute to environmental conservation efforts.",
