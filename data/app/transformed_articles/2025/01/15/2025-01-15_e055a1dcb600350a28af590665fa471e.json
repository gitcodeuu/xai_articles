    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 15 (APP): Speaker National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to conducting House proceedings strictly in accordance with parliamentary rules and regulations, and said that he would not succumb to any pressures. His remarks were made during the question hour when opposition members wanted to speak on point of order. Highlighting the importance of the House's operations, the Speaker underscored that addressing public concerns should remain the primary focus of parliamentary discussions. He said that an agreement had been reached with the opposition to avoid quorum calls or points of order during the question hour, emphasizing its critical role in addressing public grievances. \"We are elected by the people to solve their problems, and this responsibility should not be taken lightly,\" he said. The Speaker criticized the opposition for engaging in political distractions rather than focusing on substantive issues. He urged opposition members to refrain from protests and disruptions during the question hour, describing it as a crucial segment of parliamentary proceedings where ministers are held accountable for addressing key public issues. Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also pointed out the significant effort invested in preparing for the question hour and called for sessions to remain free of political interruptions. He reiterated that ministers and senior ministry officials had been repeatedly warned to ensure their presence and respond to members' queries. He termed the opposition protests and disruptions as counterproductive to the nation's interests, urging all members to approach public issues with seriousness and ensure that parliamentary proceedings are constructive and meaningful. Federal Minister for Law and Justice, Azam Nazeer Tarar, expressed disapproval of the disruptive protests during the National Assembly session, calling them inappropriate and detrimental to the House's decorum. \"Mr. Speaker, these protests are unacceptable. The members involved are interfering in photography and videography, which disrupts the decorum of the House,\" Tarar said. He urged the Speaker to take necessary actions to maintain order. The minister emphasized the need for all members to uphold the dignity of the House and focus on resolving public issues, aligning with the core purpose of parliamentary proceedings.",
