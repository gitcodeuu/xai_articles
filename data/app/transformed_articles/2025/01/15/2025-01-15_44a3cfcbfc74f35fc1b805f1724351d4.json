    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 15 (APP):Dense fog enveloped parts of Punjab, upper Sindh, and the plains of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the morning and night hours, disrupting visibility and impacting transportation. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned of continued moderate to dense fog patches in these areas over the next 24 hours. The Met Office forecast mainly cold and dry weather for most parts of the country, with very cold conditions prevailing in hilly regions. Light rain and snowfall are expected at isolated locations in Kashmir and adjoining mountainous areas, while continental air dominates most regions. Over the past 24 hours, moderate to dense fog persisted across Punjab, with a few areas in northern Balochistan experiencing light drizzle. The temperatures dropped to as low as -12C in Leh, followed by -10C in Skardu and -9C in Gupis, intensifying the chill across the northern areas. The residents are advised to exercise caution while traveling in fog-affected regions and to stay updated on weather developments.",
