    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 15 (APP):Capital Development Authority (CDA), in collaboration with the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), has unveiled its latest residential venture, Margalla Enclave. This ambitious project, promises to redefine urban living with its modern design, strategic location, and flexible payment options, CDA spokesman told APP. He said Margalla Enclave will offer residential plots in three categories: 5 Marla, 10 Marla, and 1 Kanal. He said with a variety of flexible payment plans spanning 1, 2, and 3 years, the project aims to cater to the diverse financial needs of citizens, ensuring affordability and accessibility for a broad audience. Meanwhile, Chairman CDA, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, termed this joint initiative as a \"significant milestone in Islamabad's urban development.\" He emphasized that the collaboration between CDA and DHA ensures not only a secure investment opportunity but also a promise of quality living in a meticulously planned urban environment. The enclave will feature state-of-the-art infrastructure, modern utilities, and abundant green spaces, creating a sustainable and high-standard living experience. Complete information about Margalla Enclave is available on the official CDA website. This announcement follows the remarkable success of Sector C-14, where an overwhelming response during the balloting process underscored the high demand for quality residential projects in Islamabad. Successful allottees of Sector C-14 have been encouraged to confirm their plot allocations by submitting the first installment. The CDA assured that development work in Sector C-14 is progressing rapidly, with possession to be handed over upon clearance of the final installment. Margalla Enclave exemplifies CDA's commitment to meeting the growing housing demands of Islamabad's citizens and overseas Pakistanis. It sets a new benchmark in urban planning and development, reflecting Islamabad's aspiration to become a hub of modern living. For more details, citizens can visit the CDA's official website.",
