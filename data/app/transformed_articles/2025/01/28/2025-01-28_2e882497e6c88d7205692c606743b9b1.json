The partnership, unveiled at a ceremony in Islamabad, focuses on helping these women become self-sufficient and respected members of society by providing job opportunities and enhancing their professional skills. The event was graced by PBM Managing Director, Senator Capt. Shaheen Khalid Butt, who served as the Chief Guest. Also in attendance were Amnah Aftab, Chairperson and Founder Director of HMR Foundation, and Amir Shahzad, CEO of Punjab Charity Commission, along with other distinguished guests.
