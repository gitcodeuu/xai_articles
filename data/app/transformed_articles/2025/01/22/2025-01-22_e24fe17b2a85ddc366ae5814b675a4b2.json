Salik said that the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resources had signed MoUs under state-to-state arrangements in the field of labour migration with Iraq while a proactive approach had been adopted to sign more MoUs with countries in the European Union region like Germany, Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Greece and others. Parliamentary Secretary Dr Darshan told the house that 1174 officials were appointed in the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on a contract basis for the last three years and no one has been regularized so far among them. Meanwhile replying to another question, he said that the Directorate General, Immigration and Passports was managing the Machine Readable Passport (MRP) system at 49 Pakistan Missions abroad. Responding to another question, he said that because of unplanned development along the banks of the Korang River, it was contributing to the pollution of the Rawal Dam due to the inflow of untreated wastewater. He said that wetlands had been constructed to reduce contamination, moreover, before the water was supplied to Rawalpindi it underwent treatment at the water filtration plant being managed by the Small Dam Organization under the Irrigation Department, Punjab. Dr Darshan added that a sewage treatment Plant (STP) project has been proposed to collect and treat wastewater before it enters Rawal Lake to address the issue.",
