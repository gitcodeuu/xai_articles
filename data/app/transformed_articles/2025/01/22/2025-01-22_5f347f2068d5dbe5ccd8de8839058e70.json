    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 22 (APP):The first day of the 5th Annual Rectors' Conference, organized by the Association of Private Sector Universities of Pakistan (APSUP), was held at a private hotel in Islamabad. The event witnessed the participation of over 130 vice-chancellors, rectors and prominent educators from Pakistani universities, alongside representatives from 40 international universities and OIC member countries. The conference, themed \"Character Mastery: The Key to Success and Sustainability,\" emphasized the importance of character development in students. Speakers highlighted that nations neglecting the character-building of their youth cannot achieve sustainable progress. They also lauded the efforts of APSUP and Superior University in preparing graduates for global leadership roles. The opening ceremony was attended by notable figures, including Senator Irfan Ul Haq Siddiqui, Chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) Prof Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, Member of the National Assembly Syed Mustafa Kamal, former Governor of Punjab Engr Baligh-ur-Rehman and COMSTECH Coordinator General Prof Dr Iqbal Choudhary. Senator Irfan Siddiqui emphasized that strong moral values form the foundation of progressive societies. He stressed that universities should not only serve as centers of academic learning but also promote ethical behavior and responsible citizenship. Chairman HEC Dr Mukhtar Ahmed appreciated APSUP Chairman Chaudhry Abid Rehman's efforts in organizing the conference. He remarked that a nation's true progress is reflected in the integrity and ethics of its citizens. MNA Syed Mustafa Kamal underscored the need to prioritize moral training alongside technical education. Former Governor Punjab Chaudhry Baligh-ur-Rehman stated that character education fosters social harmony. APSUP Chairman Prof Dr Chaudhry Abdul Rehman, in his keynote address, stressed the importance of character development for young graduates. He highlighted the implementation of the \"Character Mastery Framework\" at Superior University and called for its adoption across all universities in Pakistan. Dr Rehman's initiative received praise from Advisor to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs Rana Mashhood, who expressed commitment to integrating this framework into public sector institutions in collaboration with the HEC. Dr Rizwan Taj, head of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), highlighted the moral decline in society and emphasized the urgent need for character-building initiatives. He revealed that PMDC has incorporated character-building elements into the curriculum for doctors and nurses, a development that was absent before his tenure. The conference will continue on its second day, where the Rectors of Superior University and representatives from Birmingham and Oxford Universities will share their Character Mastery Work Framework with the participants. The event underscores a collective effort to prioritize ethics, integrity, and sustainability in higher education, aiming to nurture a morally responsible and globally competitive youth.",
