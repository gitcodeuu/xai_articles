    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 30 (APP):The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) organised a seminar titled \"International Year of Peace and Trust: Cooperation for Peace,\" in collaboration with the Embassy of Turkmenistan and the UN Resident Coordinator Office in Pakistan. The event included speeches by Atadjan Movlamov, Ambassador of Turkmenistan to Pakistan; Mohamed Yahya, UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan; and Ambassador Syed Haider Shah, Additional Secretary (UN and OIC) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said a press release issued here on Thursday. The working session featured talks by Ambassador Masood Khalid, former Ambassador of Pakistan to China; Ms. Ammara Durrani, Assistant Resident Representative UNDP; and Dr. Maria Saifuddin Effendi, HOD Department of Peace and Conflict Studies, NDU. In his welcome remarks, Ambassador Sohail Mahmood congratulated Turkmenistan on playing a leadership role globally in steering the process of advancing the objectives enshrined in UNGA Resolution 78/266 declaring 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust. He emphasized that peace is not merely the absence of conflict but rather is a dynamic and participatory process which requires dialogue, mutual understanding, and the ability to accept and respect differences. Ambassador Mahmood noted that the resolution's emphasis on preventive diplomacy, peaceful settlement of disputes, and peace as a lived experience is pertinent to the contemporary international environment, which is beset by divisions, discord and conflict. He highlighted the genocidal war in the Middle East, conflict in Europe, and the unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and stated that the UN and international community must fulfil their obligations towards ensuring just and lasting solutions of these issues. Ambassador Sohail Mahmood added that the International Year of Peace and Trust also serves as a moment of reflection on the contributions of various actors to the global peace agenda including women, youth, regional organisations, civil society, academia and the private sector. He also emphasised Pakistan's role in promoting international peace and security, noting that the country has a proud history of contributing to global peace efforts from UN peacekeeping to advocating peaceful resolution of disputes. These efforts are rooted in the belief that dialogue and diplomacy are the most effective means of addressing conflicts and building sustainable peace. As an elected member of the security council for the term 2025-26, Pakistan would remain in the vanguard of the efforts for promoting these objectives, he underlined. Ambassador Atadjan Movlamov noted that we are witnessing a complexity in global politics. In this backdrop, Turkmenistan advocated to consolidate international efforts for purposes of peace and trust by introducing a General Assembly resolution on \"International Year of Peace and Trust 2025.\" He said the resolution projected fundamental principles and commitments of the UN charter, particularly peaceful settlement of disputes. Turkmenistan also adopted a special program called \"The Concept of Activities and Priorities of Turkmenistan within the Framework of International Year of Peace and Trust 2025.\" He said Turkmenistan sees the implementation of the resolution as a global-scale event and a genuine opportunity for the qualitative transition of a new stage in international relations. Muhammad Yahya, the UN Resident Coordinator, remarked that the unanimous support for the International Year of Peace and Trust is an achievement in the contemporary international relations. He also noted that Pakistan has been instrumental in supporting the resolution and commended the country's diplomatic efforts. He noted that in an increasingly fragmented and intolerant world, the need for building peace and trust is becoming imperative. Peace and security are one of the three key pillars of the United Nations, along with sustainable development and human rights. Ambassador Syed Haider Shah during his address commended the efforts of Turkmenistan for promoting peace and neutrality and expressed hope that the initiative for the International Year of Peace and Trust will result in inculcating the culture of peace across the globe. He noted that without building trust and commitment to international principles we cannot see lasting peace in the world. Conflicts in different parts of the world including in Kashmir, Ukraine, Gaza, Africa, etc., are problematized by the fact that the solutions do exist without implementation. Ambassador Masood Khalid commended Turkmenistan for initiating the UN General Assembly Resolution proclaiming the International Year of Peace and Trust. He noted that the Doomsday Clock is set at '89 seconds to midnight' now, symbolizing the severe existential threats the world faces. Factors like nuclear risks, climate change, AI-driven military advancements, and failures in global governance contribute to this dire assessment. The silence of powerful nations on these atrocities undermines their claims of championing democracy and human rights, leading to a global decline in moral consciousness. Ms. Ammara Durrani noted that five areas were identified by the United Nations for enabling multilateralism. These include sustainable development and finance, international peace and security, science and technology innovation, youth and future generations, and transforming global governance. She also noted that South Asia is described as a region with strong potential, however, the potential has never been met due to tensions and vested interests in the region. Dr. Maria Effendi shared an academic perspective on UNGA Resolution 78/266, with a focus on the role of academia. She focused on three areas for people in academia to contribute to promotion of peace and trust. First, teaching and training human resource to not only speak and write on peace but also to practice it as a value. Second, the role of civil society in promoting peace advocacy. Lastly, promoting policy-oriented research to bring meaningful change in academia and policy making circles. Earlier, Dr. Talat Shabbir noted that Pakistan, as a staunch advocate of peaceful coexistence, has always supported international efforts aimed at conflict resolution and dialogue-based diplomacy. In this context, Turkmenistan's policy of permanent neutrality offers a unique model for strengthening global peace and stability. In his closing remarks, Ambassador Khalid Mahmood, Chairman BOG ISSI, noted that the United Nations was principally founded with the aspiration to promote international peace and prevent coming generations from the scourge of war. He concluded stating that celebrating and recognising the importance of international peace should not be limited to just one year but rather should be celebrated every day and every year.",
