    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 30 (APP):Zong 4G, Pakistan's leading connectivity provider, partnered with Waste Hero to organize impactful activities focused on waste management and eco-friendly practices. This collaboration underscores Zong 4G's commitment to environmental sustainability through green and low-carbon initiatives, said a news release. Key activities included an interactive session at Excellence College, where 75 students learned about waste segregation and recycling, fostering eco-conscious habits among youth. This was followed by a workshop with NICAT in Rawalpindi, where over 50 professionals and entrepreneurs explored innovative electronic waste management solutions. Building on this momentum, an awareness drive was held at Zong's headquarters, where employees took part in discussions and activities focused on e-waste disposal. The campaign concluded with a clean-up hike at Margalla Trail 5 in Islamabad, where volunteers removed 7kg of waste, highlighting the importance of preserving natural spaces. \"Through these events, we've witnessed the power of collective action in driving sustainability,\" said Andleeb Aslam, Zong 4G's spokesperson. \"At Zong, we aim to do more than just connect people. We strive to connect them with a sense of purpose and responsibility toward our planet. Together, we can lead the way to a greener, healthier Pakistan.\" Zong 4G continues to lead by integrating environmentally responsible practices into its operations, promoting waste reduction, recycling, and conservation efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and foster a culture of environmental responsibility.",
