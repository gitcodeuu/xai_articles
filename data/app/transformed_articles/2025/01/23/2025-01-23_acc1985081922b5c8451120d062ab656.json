    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 23 (APP):Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has underscored the importance of education as the cornerstone of societal development. He has said that no nation can achieve progress and development without promoting education. Speaking on the occasion of International Day of Education, observed globally on January 24 under the United Nations, the Speaker highlighted that quality education is the key to securing a prosperous future for Pakistan. \"Improving literacy and providing quality education will pave the way for national development and economic growth,\" the Speaker said. He added that education goes beyond obtaining degrees and plays a pivotal role in imparting values and societal traditions.The Speaker reaffirmed Parliament's commitment to enacting effective legislation aimed at enhancing the education system and improving literacy rates. He stressed the need for equipping the youth with modern knowledge, stating that a robust education system is essential for empowering young people and driving socio-economic progress. Underlining the constitutional obligation of the state, Ayaz Sadiq noted that providing free education to children aged 5 to 16 is the government's responsibility. He expressed concern over the alarming number of out-of-school children in the country. \"Approximately 26.8 million children, nearly half of the population in this age group, are currently out of school,\" he revealed. Many of these children are engaged in labor in workshops, homes, and other workplaces. He called for urgent measures to address this issue, emphasizing that ensuring every child's access to education is a collective responsibility, he added. The Speaker urged the implementation of the National Education Policy and Vision 2030 educational goals, describing education as not merely an individual necessity but a prerequisite for national development and prosperity. Praising Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif's initiatives for promoting education, the Speaker said, \"The Prime Minister's steps to facilitate students will serve as milestones in increasing literacy and improving education quality.\" The Speaker also appreciated the efforts of the Parliamentary Caucus on Child Rights, which recently organized a national symposium titled \"National Education Emergency: The Issue of Out-of-School Children.\" He described the symposium as a significant step toward raising awareness and building consensus on education reforms. \"The symposium's focus on educational challenges and its call for a national education emergency will strengthen our efforts to bring out-of-school children into schools,\" he said. He reiterated the need for a unified commitment to ensuring access to quality education for every child, stating, \"Today, we renew our resolve to utilize all available resources to make education accessible to every child in Pakistan.\" Deputy Speaker National Assembly, Syed Mir Ghulam Mustafa Shah also emphasized the significance of equitable access to quality education in his message. \"Education is not only a fundamental right but also the foundation for a strong and developed society,\" he said. The Deputy Speaker called for prioritizing the removal of deficiencies in the education system and ensuring quality education for children from marginalized communities. He stressed that positive reforms in the education sector and increased literacy rates are crucial for Pakistan's development.",
