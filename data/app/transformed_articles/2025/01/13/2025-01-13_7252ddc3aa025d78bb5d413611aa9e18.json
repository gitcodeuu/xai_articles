    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 13 (APP):Senator Talal Chaudhry, a senior leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N), on Monday sarcastically accused the PTI leadership of fabricating a false narrative about negotiating a deal with the government to evade accountability. Speaking to the media alongside the Minister for Information, Broadcasting, Heritage, and Culture, Attaullah Tarar, Chaudhry emphasized that no leniency would be granted to those involved in the 190 million corruption scandal. He stated that the case clearly implicated the PTI founder and his spouse, who are employing delaying tactics to evade accountability. He pointed out the contradiction between the PTI founder's ambition to establish a \"Riasat-e-Madina\" and the corruption accusations against him, particularly regarding his appropriation of entire Toshakhana gifts. Critics accuse him of wrongdoing while presenting himself as a proponent of Islamic values, yet his actions resemble those of Yazeed. Additionally, PTI government has been accused of misusing state resources and donating a portion to charity to create a false image of generosity, raising doubts about the authenticity of PTI leadership. Chaudhry also firmly rejected PTI's claims that the government offered to move the PTI founder to Nathiagali or place him under house arrest at his Banigla residence, asserting that these claims were fabricated by PTI, with no such offer from the government. Furthermore, he stated that no amnesty, similar to the NRO, would be granted to those responsible for the violence on May 9, adding that instead of defending their cases, PTI leadership seems focused on striking deals with the government. Talal Chaudhry claimed that the Al-Qadir Trust was established to conceal the 190 million corruption scandal, alleging a secret agreement to cover it up. He revealed that the British agency NCA investigated and recovered the stolen funds, which were subsequently returned to Pakistan. Chaudhry also accused Shehzad Akbar, a key figure in the PTI government, of holding regular meetings with a prominent land developer, and pointed to the involvement of PTI founder and Bushra Bibi, the wife of the PTI founder, in corruption that has caused significant harm to the country. Chaudhry praised former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for allowing the law to take its course in his own cases, even returning from London to hear the verdict. He criticized the PTI founder for using delays to prolong his legal battles.",
