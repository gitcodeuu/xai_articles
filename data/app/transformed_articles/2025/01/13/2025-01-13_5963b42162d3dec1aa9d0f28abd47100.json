    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 13 (APP):The armed forces of Uzbekistan have emerged as a cornerstone of national pride and security, reflecting the country's renewed strength under the leadership of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The Uzbek Embassy, in a statement, said the reforms initiated by the government in recent years have fundamentally transformed the country's military structure and capabilities, enabling Uzbekistan to ensure its national security, border protection, and societal stability. The Day of Defenders of the Motherland, celebrated annually on January 14, pays tribute to the valiant service of the Uzbek armed forces. The statement highlighted the unwavering dedication of military personnel, who uphold the country's sovereignty and peace while embodying the spirit and traditions of their great ancestors. The Uzbek Constitution, recently amended through a nationwide referendum, has paved the way for further strengthening the country's defense potential. The ongoing reforms aim to enhance the combat readiness of troops and modernize the armed forces to meet contemporary security challenges. The \"Uzbekistan-2030\" strategy, adopted under a presidential decree, underscores the prioritization of defense advancements. Over the past three years, more than 35 conceptual directive documents have been developed to refine troop preparation methods, drawing from the best practices of developed nations. The statement also outlined key advancements in military training and readiness. Combat and special training hours for permanent-readiness brigades have increased significantly, with 70% of exercises conducted practically and 50% taking place at night under conditions simulating real combat. Since 2018, the intensity of troop readiness exercises has increased by 2.5 times. Modular training systems have been implemented, focusing on combat coherence at various levels, while professional skills development remains a priority. The Uzbek Ministry of Defense has expanded its infrastructure, establishing 19 specialized training centers compared to just two five years ago. These centers have garnered international recognition, with military specialists from the United States, United Kingdom, France, and other nations proposing joint experience-sharing initiatives. Uzbekistan currently operates over 20 general-purpose training grounds, with 16 designated for hosting international military events. The Armed Forces actively engage in joint exercises with foreign counterparts, ensuring the continued evolution of their capabilities. In the face of global geopolitical shifts and evolving security threats, Uzbekistan's Armed Forces stand as a powerful, mobile, and well-equipped entity safeguarding the peace and harmony of the nation - a testament to the vision of New Uzbekistan.",
