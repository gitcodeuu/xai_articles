    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 13 (APP):An intra-court appeal (ICA) has been moved to Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday challenging the withdrawal of incentives from the pensioners of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The ICA is moved by the more than 300 pensioners of the CAA against the verdict of single member bench of IHC, which had previously declared the decision of CAA board as legal. The petitioners adopted the stance that medical facilities have been withdrawn from the parents and children of pensioners. They said that incentives including house grants and others were also withdrawn by the CAA. The petition prayed the court to set aside the decision of CAA and single member bench of IHC.",
