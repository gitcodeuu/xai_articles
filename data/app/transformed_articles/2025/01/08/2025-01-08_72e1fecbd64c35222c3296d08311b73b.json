Prime Minister's Coordinator for Climate Change, Romina Khurshid Alam, commended RCCI for its First Green Road initiative, calling it a vital step in addressing climate concerns. She stressed that practical actions are more impactful than mere announcements and highlighted the crucial role of the private sector in combating climate change.
