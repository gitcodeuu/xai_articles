    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP): The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Friday announced the commencement of mandatory training sessions for government-designated Hajj pilgrims across the country. According to the ministry spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt, the first training workshop will take place on Saturday, January 18, 2025 in Peshawar. Training session for pilgrims in Tando Muhammad Khan is scheduled for Sunday, January 19. On Monday, January 20, training camps will be organized in Hyderabad. Pilgrims from Kohat, Sheikhupura, and Mirpur Khas will receive their training on Tuesday, January 21. The first phase of the mandatory Hajj training program will conclude on February 27. Nationwide, training will be conducted at 147 designated locations to ensure comprehensive coverage. Participation in these training workshops is mandatory for all government Hajj pilgrims. Attendance will be recorded through a QR code system available in the Pak Hajj mobile app. Overseas Pakistanis intending to perform Hajj are required to undergo training at the respective Hajj camp prior to their journey. The ministry has urged pilgrims to strictly follow the schedule and ensure their participation in the assigned training workshops to facilitate a smooth pilgrimage experience. In addition, the ministry has intensified its preparations for Hajj 2025, with the fitness tests for assistants entering the final stages of planning. Under the supervision of Joint Secretary Hajj, Sajjad Haider Yildirim, comprehensive arrangements for the fitness tests are underway. As part of these preparations, a trial run was conducted at the Shalimar Ground for the ministry's employees to determine the optimal timing for the fitness tests. Notably, the trial run saw active participation from Joint Secretary Hajj Sajjad Haider Yildirim, Deputy Secretary Nasir Aziz Khan, and other senior officials. The fitness tests are a crucial step to ensure that the assistants are physically capable of managing the strenuous tasks and challenges associated with Hajj. The ministry intends to guarantee that Pakistani pilgrims receive seamless assistance and all necessary facilities during Hajj 2025. In conclusion, Umar Butt said this initiative underscores the ministry's commitment to providing a smooth and comfortable pilgrimage experience for Pakistani pilgrims.",
