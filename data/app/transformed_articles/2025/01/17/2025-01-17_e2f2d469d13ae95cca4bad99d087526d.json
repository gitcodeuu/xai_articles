    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP):The state-of-the-art Facilitation Center of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) has served 466,872 students and processed 66,617 applications by December 2024. While the Call center has addressed 614,574 calls related to admissions, CMS, course materials, LMS, tutors, workshops, examinations, results, and degrees, with satisfactory responses recorded for all calls. According to the official source, the Facilitation and Call Center were established by AIOU at its main campus in October 2022 to cater to the needs of its students, both nationwide and overseas. Keeping student convenience in mind, these centers were set up near Gate No. 2 of the university. As soon as students enter the university through this gate, they find these centers just a few steps away. The facilitation center offers solutions to all educational problems under one roof, eliminating the need for students to visit different university departments. Equipped with modern facilities, the center includes three counters for student advisory services, addressing issues related to workshops, tutors, CMS, LMS, admissions, examinations, NOCs, migration, applications for certificates and degrees, degree verification, corrections, and fee matters. Bank services are also available for fee submissions. Services are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, with a seating capacity for 130 students at a time. Separate washrooms for males and females, free Wi-Fi, and printing services are also offered. Priority services are extended to differently-abled students, who are provided with wheelchairs as needed. The facilitation center operates with a modern queuing system. Students generate a token from an electronic kiosk near the entrance and wait comfortably for their turn. Token numbers are displayed on screens and announced via microphone. This efficient system ensures minimal waiting time. The center's overall operations are overseen by Director Student Affairs, Syed Ghulam Kazim Ali, and Facilitation Center Incharge, Atif Farooq Solangi-two highly dedicated officials who report daily to Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr. Nasir Mehmood. The call center, with its 35 cabins, handles student inquiries over the phone. Students can call the university's helpline at 051-111-11-2468, where their queries are directed to the relevant operator. Before the establishment of these centers, students faced significant delays in resolving their issues, often requiring multiple visits to various departments. This caused frustration, leading to false narratives about inefficiency and negative publicity for the university, which adversely impacted enrollments. However, with the facilitation and call centers now operational, students' issues are resolved swiftly, enhancing their experience and satisfaction. Many students who previously criticized the system now praise it and promote the university in their communities, encouraging others to enroll. Talking to APP, AIOU's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Dr. Nasir Mehmood, emphasized that illuminating every household with the light of education and addressing students' needs is a top priority. He stated, \"Students are our greatest asset, and they have the first claim on our resources. We spare no effort in ensuring their convenience.\" His focus on educational quality has also resulted in notable achievements. In the 2024 Impact Rankings by the globally respected Times Higher Education, AIOU ranked first among Pakistan's 89 universities and seventh among 2,175 universities from 125 countries for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education. With over 1.1 million students enrolled, AIOU is Pakistan's largest university, boasting more students than the combined total of all other universities in the country. Managing such a vast number of students, addressing their issues, and fulfilling their needs is no small feat. However, persistence and determination make the impossible achievable. Following its mission, the university has reached new milestones.",
