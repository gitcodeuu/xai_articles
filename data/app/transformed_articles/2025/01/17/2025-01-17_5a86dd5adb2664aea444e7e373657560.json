    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP):The 1st three-day International Stakeholders Workshop on Industrial Hemp Value Chain, organized by the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (UAF) in collaboration with the Industrial & Medicinal Hemp Foundation of Pakistan (IMHF) concluded on Friday. The Ministry of Defense recognized the importance of sustainable agricultural practices and their role in economic development, said a press release. This workshop aims to convene experts, policymakers, and industry leaders to discuss the developments, challenges, and opportunities within the industrial hemp value chain. Over the past four years, both the UAF and IMHF have made significant strides in establishing comprehensive value chains for the textile, food, and bio-composites industries, particularly through collaboration with international partners. Industrial hemp has been globally recognized for its sustainable and resource-efficient properties. Its cultivation offers numerous environmental benefits by encouraging land and water stewardship and regenerative agriculture practices. Furthermore, the recent approval of the Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority Act 2024 (CCRA), positions Pakistan to capitalize on this high-value crop, thereby fostering industry development and creating new job opportunities across various sectors. CCRA has been established to regulate the cultivation of the cannabis plant, extraction, refining, manufacturing, and sale of derivatives of the plant for medicinal and industrial use in various sectors. The versatility of industrial hemp allows it to meet diverse market demands, ranging from textiles and food to paper, plastics, packaging, construction, and biofuels. The remarkable carbon sequestration abilities of industrial hemp will also allow Pakistan to participate in the global voluntary carbon credit market. By promoting the industrial hemp value chain, we will not only enhance our agricultural productivity but also contribute to the economic resilience of Pakistan. All stakeholders are encouraged to participate in this important workshop, which represents a step forward in harnessing the potential of industrial hemp for the benefit of economy and environment.",
