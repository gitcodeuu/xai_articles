An official told APP that during the meetings, the IGP Rizvi demoted the Station House Officer (SHO) of Sihala to the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) over poor performance. Similarly, the Investigation In-charge of Koral Police Station was transferred to the police lines for unsatisfactory work, while the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Investigations in Sawan Zone and Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Koral were asked to provide explanations for their weak performance. On the other hand, SHO Humak and the Investigation In-charge of Humak Police Station were commended for their exemplary work. Both officers were awarded appreciation certificates and cash rewards of one lakh rupees each. The IGP Rizvi emphasized that all officers must work with a spirit of public service to control crime effectively. \"Officers delivering exceptional performance will be rewarded, while those failing to meet expectations will face consequences,\" he said.
