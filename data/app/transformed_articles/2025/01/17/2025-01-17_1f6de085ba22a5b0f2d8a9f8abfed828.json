    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP):Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting, National Heritage and Culture Attaullah Tarar said on Friday that the defense counsel fought 190 million corruption case on political grounds and did not submit any evidence to counter proofs given by the prosecution. During media talk outside Parliament House along with Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, he said that 190 million pounds scam was the mega corruption case in Pakistan's history. The minister said the judge in the verdict stated that the defense counsel could not present evidence to prove innocence of the accused. He said that the defense team could not even respond to the evidence of bribery, corruption and misuse of power and authority provided by the prosecution. The founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf could not present solid evidence in court to prove his innocence in the court. He lamented that the PTI had the habit of using religion card and in this case they tried to hide behind the religion. He said that in Zaman Park Lahore, a house was built with the confiscated money received from the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency. The Al-Qadir Trust,he opined was created to launder black money earned through corruption and bribery. Attaullah Tarar said that they had the right of appeal but they will have to prove that no sealed envelope was brought to the cabinet meeting and it did not approve the agenda item. The defense counsel will have to prove that no house was built in Lahore with that money. He said it was ironic that the money confiscated by NCA and returned to Pakistan government was returned to the person from whom it was taken. \"Corruption and bribery are proven in this case, misuse of authority is also proven, \" Attaullah Tarar maintained. The minister said that sentence was awarded to the accused while fulfilling the legal requirements. The sentence passed was on merit, the accused had failed to prove their innocence, he remarked. He said that reputed lawyers and neutral analysts were saying about this verdict was in accordance with the law as bribery, corruption and robbery have been proven by the prosecution. He said the government had in its possession the documents of Asset Recovery Unit headed by Shahzad Akbar. In those documents it was written that 190 million amount was recovered money received from NCA.",
