    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday removed the objection to the review application concerning prison conditions for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) founder and directed the Registrar's Office to schedule a hearing on Monday. Chief Justice Aamer Farooq of the Islamabad High Court set aside the Registrar Office's objection to the petition filed by the PTI founder's legal team. Advocates Faisal Farid Chaudhary and Bina Faraz appeared before the court to present the case. During the proceedings, the court asked Advocate Faisal Chaudhary about the basis of the application. He explained that the trial court's January 10 order by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand, addressing prison facilities, had been challenged. The petition raised concerns about the lack of proper facilities for a high-profile prisoner, describing the prison authorities' attitude as inconsistent with the law and the Constitution. It urged the court to ensure compliance with legal standards for justice and humane treatment. The petitioner demanded several measures, including weekly phone calls with children, access to books and newspapers and regular meetings with family members and legal representatives. The court directed the Registrar's Office to address the matter promptly and schedule the hearing for Monday.",
