Although, some of the witness including 1.0 IPW-35 had to undergo lengthy and exhaustive cross examination yet the same could not even shake the creditability of these witnesses. During the appreciation, their deposition were found consistent and coherent as a whole. There might be certain minor discrepancies and contradictions in the prosecution evidence which are but natural in such like cases of white collar crimes.

NAB prosecutors Irfan Ahmed, Sohail Arif, Owais Arshad Adiala, PTI founder's sister Aleema Khan, PTI lawyer Barrister Salman Akram Raja, and Bushra Bibi's daughter and son-in-law were also in attendance.

The 190 million pounds case involves a reference filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against former prime minister Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others in December 2023. The case centres around an alleged settlement between the PTI government and a property tycoon, which reportedly caused a loss of 190 million pounds to Pakistan's national exchequer. Khan and the other accused are alleged to have misused 190 million pounds sent by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) as part of the settlement. Bushra Bibi was named an accused for her role as a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust. Additionally, the couple is accused of receiving undue benefits, including over 458 kanal in Mauza Bakrala, Sohawa, for the establishment of Al-Qadir University. During Khan's tenure, the NCA seized 190 million pounds worth of assets from the tycoon. The assets were meant to be handed to Pakistan, with the settlement deemed a civil matter by the NCA. However, the details of the confidential agreement were not disclosed when Khan's cabinet approved it in December 2019. Subsequently, the Al-Qadir Trust was established in Islamabad.",
