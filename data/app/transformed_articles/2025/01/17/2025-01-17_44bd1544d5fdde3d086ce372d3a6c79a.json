    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP): Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) Muhammad Ali Randhawa, accompanied by relevant officers, inspected the ongoing construction work at the Serena Interchange project on Friday. During the visit, he reviewed progress and issued directives to expedite the completion of the project. The CDA Chairman was briefed on various aspects of the development, including the rapid pace of cleaning activities at the Serena Underpass on Khayaban-e-Soharwardy. Officials also reported that structural work on the underpasses at Srinagar Highway has entered its final phase, with construction advancing simultaneously across all sections of the project. Chairman Randhawa emphasized the importance of completing beautification and horticulture work around the underpasses without delay. He directed that the finishing touches on the Srinagar Highway underpasses be completed within this month to open them for public use. He further instructed teams to prioritize landscaping and plantation on adjacent green belts to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the area. To ensure timely delivery, Chairman Randhawa called for round-the-clock construction activities and reiterated that no compromise on quality standards would be tolerated. \"The highest quality of construction work must be ensured to provide long-term benefits to the city,\" he stated. He added that the completion of the Serena Interchange project would resolve longstanding traffic congestion issues in the capital, offering residents signal-free travel and reducing environmental pollution. \"This initiative will significantly improve the quality of life for Islamabad's residents,\" he remarked. The Serena Interchange project is seen as a crucial step in enhancing the city's infrastructure and addressing the growing traffic needs of the capital. With strict timelines in place, the CDA aims to deliver the project promptly, ensuring better connectivity and sustainable urban development.",
