    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 19 (APP):The Gandhara Resource Centre Pakistan (GRCP) has announced the third annual Gandhara Citrus Festival, scheduled to take place on January 26, 2025 at the Taxila Garden. This festival promises to be a unique celebration of the region's agricultural prosperity, cultural heritage, and the ancient Gandhara civilisation, the organisers told APP. Following the success of previous events, this year's festival aims to promote agri-tourism, showcase the renowned Khanpur oranges in their many varieties, and highlight the exquisite stonework of the Gandhara civilisation on an international stage. One of the festival's key objectives is to foster appreciation for the cultural heritage and tourism potential of Gandhara. By highlighting the historical significance and grandeur of Gandhara's ancient sites, the event seeks to strengthen local tourism while raising global awareness about the importance of preserving this region's rich legacy. According to organisers, the festival will feature an array of engaging activities, including food stalls, orange stalls, tours of citrus orchards, live painting sessions, exhibitions of stone carvings, book stalls, and displays of traditional clothing and textiles. A particular focus will be placed on showcasing the diverse varieties of Khanpur oranges to strengthen connections between local farmers and exporters, ultimately boosting the recognition of these citrus fruits on national and international levels. The event will also serve as a platform for Gandhara's stone carvers, connecting them with global buyers and introducing their unique craftsmanship to the world. Visitors will have the opportunity to purchase locally grown oranges, handicrafts, and other agricultural products. Meanwhile, artists participating in live painting sessions will creatively interpret themes inspired by Gandhara's cultural and citrus heritage. The exhibition of stone carvings will highlight the extraordinary talent of local artisans. For exporters, researchers, and academics, the festival offers a vital platform to build networks and exchange ideas on significant issues such as cultural heritage conservation, environmental sustainability, and food security. The event is not only a celebration of Gandhara's cultural and historical wealth but also a meaningful step towards community development and the promotion of local agriculture and craftsmanship.",
