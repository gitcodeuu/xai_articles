    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 16 (APP):The Executive Engineer (EXN) of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), Sohaib Abbasi, issued a three-day ultimatum on Thursday to the jetty owners at Khanpur Dam, instructing them to halt all water sports activities and remove all jets and boats from the dam reservoir by the end of the deadline. The decision comes in response to complaints about the contamination of the dam's water supply, which serves the residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. According to reports, the water sports activities, along with boats and litter left by participants, were found to be polluting the water environment. Sohaib Abbasi emphasized that this action was essential to prevent further pollution and protect the water quality for the citizens of both cities. The goal is to ensure a continuous supply of clean and safe water for residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The notice has called on the jetty owners to comply with the order, stressing the importance of protecting the dam's ecosystem and the quality of water for public health.",
