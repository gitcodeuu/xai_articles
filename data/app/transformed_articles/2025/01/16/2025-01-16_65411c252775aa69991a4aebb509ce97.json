    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 16 (APP):Federal Minister for Education Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has called for tangible actions to promote the mental development of school-going children, highlighting the issue of stunted growth among children in Pakistan. Speaking at the Educational Emergency Program on Thursday, the minister expressed concern over the various reasons why children are not attending school, while also questioning the lack of teacher presence in many educational institutions. The minister stated that in recent years, our region has seen tremendous development, particularly in neighboring countries. However, in Pakistan, change remains limited to mere slogans and he stressed the need to shift this approach. Siddique also emphasized the urgent need to control population growth, drawing attention to the global approaches to managing population levels.",
