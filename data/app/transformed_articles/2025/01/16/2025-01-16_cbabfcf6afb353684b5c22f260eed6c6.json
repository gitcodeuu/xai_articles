    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 16 (APP):Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Islamabad, Syed Ali Raza, has announced to reactivate the mediation committees (Masalhati Kameti ) under the Islamabad Capital Police on Thursday during a ceremony held at Shalimar Police Station. A Public Relations Officer informed APP that DIG Raza, after discussions with members of the mediation committees and citizens, made the decision to reactivate these committees in collaboration with the local police stations. DIG Raza further stated that these committees will operate 24/7 at the police station level, offering immediate and merit-based solutions for minor issues. On the occasion, DIG Raza emphasized that the primary goal of these mediation committees is to separate personal matters from police station duties and provide relief to citizens. He added that this initiative would save valuable time for both the police and the judiciary, allowing them to focus on more significant matters. \"The committees will help resolve minor issues at the local level, enabling citizens to find quick solutions. The mediation process will be conducted in a manner that ensures fairness, with members selected from various sectors of society,\" DIG Raza explained. DIG Raza also highlighted that the mediation committees are built on key values of transparency, impartiality, and merit, ensuring an inclusive and fair process for resolving disputes. \"The members of the mediation committees include citizens from all walks of life,\" he said, stressing the importance of diverse participation.
