    "article_body": "FAISALABAD, Jan 16 (APP):Forced labour remains a significant challenge in Pakistan, with estimates suggesting that over three million people are trapped in exploitative conditions, speakers a workshop said Thursday. This was highlighted at a two-day training workshop organized by International Labour Organization (ILO), in collaboration with the US Department of Labour (USDOL) in Faisalabad. The workshop was part of the BRIDGE Project, aimed at eradicating forced labour and promoting fair recruitment practices. The workshop brought together 30 journalists from print, electronic, radio, and digital media platforms. It was pointed out that migrant workers are particularly vulnerable, being three times more likely to experience forced labour compared to non-migrants. Over the past decade, more than 6.5 million Pakistanis have migrated abroad for employment, mainly to Gulf Cooperation Council countries, underscoring the urgency of addressing this issue. Dr. Faisal Iqbal, National Project Coordinator at ILO, emphasized the media's critical role in raising awareness about forced labour and labour migration. \"Media can significantly influence public perceptions and accountability on forced labour issues,\" Dr. Iqbal noted. He shared the ILO's 11 indicators of forced labour, such as wage retention, debt bondage, and abusive working conditions, and discussed findings from ILO's 2024 report, which highlights the $236 billion in annual profits generated globally by forced labour. He also stressed the importance of tackling forced labour in Pakistan's supply chains, particularly given the EU's new regulations banning products made with forced labour by 2027. Award-winning journalist and media trainer Aoun Abbas Sahi led sessions focused on the media's responsibility in addressing forced labour and fair recruitment. \"Forced labour and migration are not priority areas in Pakistani media, despite their relevance to millions of people and the economy,\" he said. He stressed extensive coverage of the regions like Faisalabad, where forced labour is prevalent in sectors such as textiles, agriculture, and brick kilns. Sahi emphasized the need for a rights-based and gender-sensitive approach to reporting, particularly when interviewing survivors, and trained participants in identifying compelling stories, collecting data, and crafting human-centered narratives across media platforms. The workshop concluded with interactive sessions, group discussions, and practical exercises, reflecting a growing commitment among journalists to tackle forced labour and promote fair recruitment practices. \"While accurate data on forced labour in Pakistan is unavailable, estimates suggest that over 3 million individuals are affected,\" noted Dr. Iqbal. \"Media must play a vital role in highlighting these issues and advocating for solutions,\" he said.",
