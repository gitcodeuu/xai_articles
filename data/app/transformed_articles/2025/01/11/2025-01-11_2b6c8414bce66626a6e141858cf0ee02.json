    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 11 (APP):The 47th death anniversary of eminent Urdu poet and travelogue writer Ibn-e-Insha is being observed on Saturday by paying glowing tribute to him. Born in Jalandhar district of Indian Punjab in 1927, he later migrated to Pakistan. Ibn-e-Insha's poetry was simple but had depth. The real cause of his popularity was his humorous poetry and columns. His humorous books are \"Khumar-e-Gandum\" and \"Urdu Ki Aakhri Kitaab\". His collection of letters is titled \"Khat Insha Jee Kay\". Ibn-e-Insha was awarded Presidential Pride of Performance Award in 1978. He died on January 11, 1978 and was laid to rest in Karachi.",
