Organized by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training in collaboration with the National Heritage and Cultural Division, the Cultural Evening was held in honour of the delegates attending the International Conference on Girls' Education, which was attended by academics as well as representatives from UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank. Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ms. Ambreen Jan, along with senior officials of the National Heritage and Culture Division, welcomed the delegations.
