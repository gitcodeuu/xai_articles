    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 11 (APP):Speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said on Saturday that neither the government nor the opposition has contacted him to convene a meeting of the negotiation committees. In a statement, he said, \"There has been no communication from either side to schedule a meeting, but I am ready to convene a session with one- or two-day notice whenever both parties agree.\" Addressing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) negotiation committee's demand to meet the party's founder, the Speaker clarified, \"It is the government's responsibility to facilitate such a meeting. This matter does not fall under my jurisdiction.\" He further said that the government and its allies should decide whether the meeting is feasible or not. He said that during a telephonic conversation with PTI leader Asad Qaiser on January 4, he informed him that the demand for a meeting with the PTI founder had been conveyed to the government.\" He advised PTI leaders to directly approach Rana Sanaullah or other senior representatives of the government.",
