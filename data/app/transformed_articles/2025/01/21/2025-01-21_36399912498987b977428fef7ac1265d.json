    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 21 (APP):Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday granted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) additional time until February 11 to respond to the foreign funding case. A three-member bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja heard the PTI intra-party elections case at the Election Commission of Pakistan. Chairman PTI Barrister Gohar represented the PTI. Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja expressed concern that the PTI intra-party elections case has been ongoing since April 30, 2024, yet the party has failed to submit a written response. CEC Raja instructed PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan to respond five petitions and notices. In reply, Barrister Gohar stated that they have already responded to the notices and will submit replies to the petitions at the next hearing. The lawyer for petitioner Akbar S. Babar requested the Election Commission of Pakistan to freeze PTI's bank accounts until a decision is reached in the foreign funding case. However, the commission instructed PTI to submit its response by the next hearing, and adjourned the hearing case until February 11.",
