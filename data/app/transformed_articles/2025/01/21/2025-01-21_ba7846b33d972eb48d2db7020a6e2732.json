    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 21 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA), Muhammad Ali Randhawa, accompanied by Member Engineering and other officials, visited the Serena Interchange construction site on Tuesday to review ongoing development activities. During the visit, Chairman Randhawa received a comprehensive briefing from project officers, who reported significant progress on the project. Officials highlighted that the structural work on both underpasses along Srinagar Highway has been completed, with asphalt work advancing rapidly. To ensure timely delivery, construction activities are being carried out simultaneously in multiple segments and around the clock. The Chairman was also informed that beautification efforts are underway alongside construction. Once the underpasses are opened for traffic, landscaping, tree plantation, and the installation of permanent aesthetic lighting will enhance the project's visual appeal. Directing the project team, Chairman Randhawa emphasized the urgency of completing all construction activities within the current month. He instructed that permanent lighting installations and landscaping on the surrounding green belts be expedited. Additionally, he stressed that construction quality must adhere to the highest standards and warned against any compromise in quality. \"The Serena Interchange is a milestone in modernizing Islamabad's infrastructure. Its completion will resolve the longstanding traffic congestion at Serena Chowk and provide citizens with a seamless, signal-free commuting experience,\" Chairman Randhawa stated. He further directed consultants and resident engineers to maintain strict quality assurance protocols on-site to ensure the project meets international standards. The Serena Interchange is a flagship initiative aimed at addressing traffic congestion and improving road connectivity in the capital. Once completed, it is expected to significantly enhance the flow of traffic and provide a modernized commuting experience for residents and visitors alike.",
