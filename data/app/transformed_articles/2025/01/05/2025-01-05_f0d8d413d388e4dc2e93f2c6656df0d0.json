He said that people of Khyber Pakthunkhwa had also voted during referendum in favour of Pakistan in 1947. Engr Amir Muqam said that on the other hands, the people of Khyber Pakthunkhwa were deceived on the name of so called change for third time by PTI where problems of masses increased significantly due to poor governance, ramage of corruption and the use of financial resources on agitation politics. He said that it would have been made better if the share of NFC award given to KP was used on the people welfare, strengthening of counter terrorism department and police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa rather than launching attacks on Islamabad. He said that PTI agenda was not welfare of masses rather person-specific. He said that PMLN was the only party that can give tough time to PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
