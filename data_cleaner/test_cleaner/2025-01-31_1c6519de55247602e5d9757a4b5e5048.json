A helpline will be established between NAB and the OPF for constant liaison to address complaints.\n\nEarlier, an OPF delegation gave a detailed briefing on the working of the OPF and issues faced by oversees Pakistanis.\n\nOn the occasion, the NAB chairman emphasised that overseas Pakistanis are a valuable asset of the country, and the bureau, in collaboration with the OPF, will take all possible measures to resolve their issues. He said NAB would ensure that those who cheated overseas Pakistanis would be given appropriate legal punishments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025",
