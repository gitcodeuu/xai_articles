    "# Step 1 — Purpose & Overview\n",
    "#\n",

    "# on a single example JSON. It is organized into small, numbered steps so you can run them\n",
    "# one-by-one or end-to-end.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# What this notebook is for\n",
    "# - Quickly test changes to `cleaner.py` on a single file before batch processing.\n",
    "# - Verify the transformation output structure and a short preview of the content.\n",
    "# - Troubleshoot common issues (missing imports, missing input file, or bad JSON).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Inputs and outputs\n",
    "# - Input: a raw article JSON file located in the same folder as this notebook.\n",
    "# - Output: a transformed JSON written to the `./transformed_articles/` folder.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# What you will do\n",
    "# - Verify imports and environment (Step 2)\n",
    "# - Define input/output paths and filenames (Step 3)\n",
    "# - Validate the input and prepare the output folder (Step 4)\n",
    "# - Run the processing function (Step 5)\n",
    "# - Verify that the transformed file was produced and is valid JSON (Step 6)\n",
    "# - (Optional) Compare the original and transformed payloads (Step 7)\n",
    "# - (Optional) Reset the output file to re-run cleanly (Step 8)\n",

The main objective of the MoU was to create an efficient and collaborative mechanism whereby the OPF and NAB would jointly address and resolve grievances reported by overseas Pakistanis. According to a press release, such grievances may encompass, without limitation, fraudulent practices in housing schemes, disputes pertaining to property possession, allotment and incidents of financial mismanagement or irregularities perpetrated by housing developers and private individuals. Under MoU, a dedicated facilitation desk or cell at all NAB offices, including the head office, will be established to receive and process complaints referred by the OPF or overseas Pakistanis, directly. A helpline will be established between NAB and the OPF for constant liaison to address complaints. Earlier, an OPF delegation gave a detailed briefing on the working of the OPF and issues faced by oversees Pakistanis. On the occasion, the NAB chairman emphasised that overseas Pakistanis are a valuable asset of the country, and the bureau, in collaboration with the OPF, will take all possible measures to resolve their issues. He said NAB would ensure that those who cheated overseas Pakistanis would be given appropriate legal punishments. Published in Dawn, January 31st, 2025\",\n",
